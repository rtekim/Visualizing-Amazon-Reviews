The author, William Golding, plays with intriguing characters such as Ralph and Simon who are not the stereotypical good- guy and bad- guy, but have their own ways of survival on the island.<br /><br />  The pace of the book as well as the descriptions are well written to give the reader enough information and background to describe the settings and characters rather than over doing every description and boring the reader.<br /><br />  In short, this book is well paced, has good descriptions and characters to relate to, and has enough depth to keep re reading the book.	2015-07-19

I've always loved survival and dystopian novels, so this seemed right up my alley. Over the course of the novel, the group of boys stranded on the island degenerates from a hopeful system of democracy and order into savage chaos.<br /><br />Despite the fact that this book takes place in the confines of a deserted island, Golding uses these boys as a microcosm representing the entire political world and human nature itself. Ralph strives for order and struggles to maintain civilization among chaos. Jack is blinded by power and blood lust, undermining the good of the group for his own ends. Piggy represents the intellectual community with his vast knowledge and practical ideas, but with poor social skills and lack of physical capabilities. Finally, Simon represents the basic good of human nature at it's most base level with his nurturing personality and connection to nature.<br /><br />I saw myself and my childhood memories in the politics of these boys, as well as the political realities that plague my adult reality. We all want to stop the suffering in our world, but how can we do it when the masses are easily swayed by more charismatic people offering fun and games? What do you do when you see how to fix a problem, but no one will listen to you because you're not popular?<br /><br />A masterpiece.	2015-07-12

I don't even know WHY I'm posting this review here, and on Goodreads, since there are already so many... but here goes....<br />Hmm. This book was WAY too long. There was absolutely no build-up to the last four chapters in the first eight, and most of the time I felt bored with the story. However, I normally dislike books classic, or books written in the 20th century. I'm well aware that this book was published in 2003, but the style of the writing is similar to ones like the Hobbit (I enjoyed the Hobbit WAY more than this. All the same, the last four chapters made this story (hardly) worth it, because it did a great job of using these children as a metaphor of our human race (no, I know we don't run around calling ourselves savages and putting war-paint on our faces, striving to kill as many pigs as possible and leaving the head for &#34;the beast.&#34;) I was scared along with Ralph, and this story felt very (almost terrifyingly) real at the end... probably until the Naval officer found them. But that's not really the point of the story, although naval officers don't just swoop in and save you everyday (the fire alerting the officer was understandable, though.)<br />The characters, though, also bugged me. There were way too many of them - Simon, Samneric, the ten or something &#34;liluns,&#34; Roger, Ralph, Piggy, Jack... probably thirty of them. My brother and I were both wondering how all these kids came to be in this plane crash together, and why, by little chance, no adults were left surviving. Were there really so many more kids that not a single adult survived?<br />Overall, this book barely earned two stars at the end for the last four chapters, and though I complained a lot in this review, I'd suggest just skipping to the last four, worthwhile chapters, and then if you're still curious, reading every, excruciating,  first eight chapters.	2015-06-23

I will not rehash the plot of The Lord of the Flies since anyone with an ounce of knowledge about classic literature knows the ‘Robinson Crusoe’ premise. Instead I would like to address an important political ethic in this book—the definition of freedom.<br /><br />Unfortunately, most people today don’t seem to understand what TRUE FREEDOM is. They think it means doing whatever you want. But that’s not what the Founding Fathers or the Pilgrims thought. The Founders weren’t fighting the War for Independence to fornicate whenever they wanted to, intoxicate themselves or beat their slaves to death. Yes, Alexander Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin were womanizers, Thomas Paine was fond of alcohol and George Washington had slaves but THAT is NOT what they were FIGHTING FOR. The Pilgrims didn’t sail to the New World to carouse whenever they wanted—yes there WERE shady characters like the Billington brothers—but THAT is NOT WHY they set sail the Mayflower. These people were breaking loose from England to GOVERN THEMSELVES—NOT UNDER THE THREAT OF ANY GOVERNMENT but rather according to the laws of NATURE and NATURE’S GOD. (Thou shall not steal, thou shall not murder, etc.) Chaos and Freedom are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS. There MUST be AN ORDER for freedom to exist. You CANNOT HAVE FREEDOM WITHOUT MORALITY. If you try you’re not going to build a strong dedication to it.<br /><br />Freedom is the ability and power to choose good over evil even when there are NO POLICE, NO JAIL, NO ELECTRIC CHAIR, NO LETHAL INJECTION, NO HANGMAN’S NOOSE to install a sense of fear in you—because you KNOW in your heart what course of action you SHOULD choose.<br /><br />This concept is best illustrated towards the climax of The Lord of the Flies when Piggy demands Jack return the glasses he stole from him (in order to gain the upper hand on who could start a fire) not out of any desire to make a bargain but rather in plea from having his COMMON RATION OF BASIC HUMANITY taken from him. “Look…you’re stronger than I am and you haven’t got asthma. You can see…with both eyes. But I don’t ask for my glasses back, not as a favor. I don’t ask you to be a sport. Not because you’re strong but because WHAT’S RIGHT’S RIGHT! Give me my glasses back! You’ve GOT to!”<br /><br />How much easier would life on the island have been if Jack just said “Okay Piggy. YOU’RE the one who wear glasses. YOU BE IN CHARGE OF LIGHTING the fires?” Instead of constantly grabbing them off his face until one lens broke? Instead, Piggy had to be denied his sight (and later his life) all because ONE BOY could not swallow his pride and lust for power.<br /><br />Piggy is what one would call the moral compass of the book, for despite being the social misfit, he always sees what the others miss. He brings up the subject of building huts right after all the other boys used the wood they gathered for a bonfire. He says some of the bigger children ought to look after the smaller ones. He emphasizes the importance of giving everyone who raises his hand a right to ‘hold the conch’ during meetings. Even his dying words are a final plea for the avocation of civilization. “Which is better—to be a pack of painted Indians like you are, or to be sensible like Ralph is? Which is better—to have rules and agree, to hunt and kill? Which is better, law and rescue or hunting and breaking things up?”<br /><br />When Maurice throws sand at Percival as a mean joke, he stops to think. “In his other life, Maurice had received chastisement for filling a younger eye with sand. Now, though there was no parent to let fall a heavy hand, Maurice still felt the unease of wrongdoing. At the back of his mind formed the uncertain outlines of an excuse. He muttered something about a swim and broke into a trot.”<br /><br />As Henry explores the beach he comes to a place where “Creatures of tiny transparencies that came questing in with the water over the hot, dry sand, lived…This was fascinating to Henry. He poked about with a bit of stick that itself was wave worn and whitened…and tried to control the motions of the scavengers. He made little runnels that the tide filled and tried to crowd them with creatures. He became absorbed beyond mere happiness as he felt himself exercising control over living things. He talked to them urging them, ordering them. Driven back by the tide, his footprints became bays in which they were trapped and gave him the illusion of mastery.”<br /><br />What I love best about this book is how it opposes the theory that power corrupts people—a person is already either honorable or corrupt—power merely brings it out more. Some would argue Jack became a villain due to the grueling circumstances of survival in the tropics but there were plenty of indications he was no good from the get go even before he dethroned Ralph. Look how he called Piggy ‘Fatty.’ Look how he repeatedly abused the law of silence when he didn’t have the conch during assemblies. Look how divisive he was when he and Ralph were searching for the beast.<br /><br />Even before Ralph was elected chief at the beginning, look how he stood up for Piggy when Jack called him ‘Fatty’ and tried to comfort Piggy when he cried over the teasing. “I’m sorry I said your name was Piggy. I forgot you told me not to. But ‘Piggy’ is still better than ‘Fatty’ so cheer up.” Ralph certainly has his faults but at least he is humble enough to admit them.<br /><br />Class, refinement and good morals are NOT from your background, race or upbringing as the sailor at the end of the book assumes. “REALLY. I should have thought a pack of British boys would have been able to put up a better show than that.” Rather these attributes come from the CHOICES you make as an individual on an everyday basis.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this book. Great for discussions.ot, dry sand, lived…This was fascinating to Henry. He poked about with a bit of stick that itself was wave worn and whitened…and tried to control the motions of the scavengers.

But ‘Piggy’ is still better than ‘Fatty’ so cheer up.” Ralph certainly has his faults but at least he is humble enough to admit them.<br /><br />Class, refinement and good morals are NOT from your background, race or upbringing as the sailor at the end of the book assumes. “REALLY. I should have thought a pack of British boys would have been able to put up a better show than that.” Rather these attributes come from the CHOICES you make as an individual on an everyday basis.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this book. Great for discussions.	2015-06-12

Lord of the Flies deals with deep issues regarding human behavior, therefore I don't think that anyone younger than 10 would be able to fully grasp what was taking place in the story. However, in William Golding's beautifully written novel, we have a contemporary classic that has stood the test of time. Golding does a great job introducing all the characters at the beginning of the book, not focusing too much on any one particular character, not even the main character, Ralph. By the end of the book, the reader will feel as if they've know all the boys stranded on the island for their entire lives, that's how well Golding practices his character development in the novel. Not only will you get to know the characters, but when I was reading the book, I could practically see the island as if I was stranded on it along with Ralph, Jack, Piggy, and the rest of the boys. Golding described everything on the island in painstakingly precise detail, and the result was the feeling that I was actually on the island. I thought that Golding did a great job with the mood and tone of the book. The started off with an adventurous, excited mood. At first, the boys seemed to think that the  island was just a game, and they jested at being adults. However, as time went on and the boys still weren't rescued, the tone changed. Now it was desperate, as fights broke out and allegiances changed. The end of the book was dark and foreboding, telling readers of the worst possible traits human kind possesses, dealing with dark issues present in everyone. I think the reason this book is still commonly read 60 years after it was published is how deep the book goes. The complications Ralph and the rest of the boys in the book are actually deeper than they appear. The common need for survival is deeply-rooted in all humans, and it takes its worst shape during the course of this book. Almost everything in the book is symbolic, even the island itself. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for something to read that will make them think, and maybe even reconsider life itself.<br />By: Nicky Ferraioloeven the island itself.

Conceptually and symbolically this is one of the most complex yet understandable and teachable novels I've ever encountered for gifted middle level students. I don't agree with Golding's dark view of human nature, but one can't argue Golding's artistry and complete mastery of his subject matter. Who can ever forget Simon's &#34;interview&#34; with the Lord of the Flies at the end of Chapter 8, which is one of the great scenes in all literature? This book is a must-read; I rue the day when students no longer read it (like they no longer read &#34;Brave New World&#34; or &#34;1984.&#34;)	2015-04-24

Read this book for the first time in high school and enjoyed it. Now that I am a teacher I finally needed a new copy due to the condition of the old one. The size of this edition is small and does not take up much space. If you have not read this classic you are missing out. The civilization allegory carried throughout is dark and ominous. You forgot as you read that all of the characters are under 12. I will not give it away but I recommend it.	2015-04-22

This book is about multiple British boys getting stranded on an island after their plane pilot dies in a crash. The boys try to govern themselves under a &#34;chief&#34; named Ralf, but soon enough, under a threat of a great beast, the boys separate into two groups. One of the groups slaughter a pig and set its head on a stake for a sacrifice for the beastI chose this book because a friend recommended it to me. My favorite thing about this book is the vast amount of symbolism it has, my favorite symbol being the fall of civilization, which is represented by literally falling. My least favorite part of the book is how slow the story advances, the climax being very late into the story. I would recommend this book virtually anyone; the book was an enjoyable read.	2015-04-18

It demonstrates what can happen to people who are placed in difficult circumstances, like the characters in this book. My year 10 (G1) students love this book.

It was enjoyable, but there were too many characters that I disliked, and to be fair, I was young when I read it, so it definitely gave me more of a negative bias against it at the time.<br /><br />The dystopian theme was very well presented and Golding definitely did a very good job of portraying the escalating chaos and madness as it descended on the more savage boys on the island.	2015-04-12

The style that William Golding is very creative but at the same time it is very hard to understand for my age. My favourite character is Piggy as he portrays a character that I can relate to very much and I also feel sorry for him with all the boys bullying him. This book feels very real life when you are reading it. Over the period of time whilst reading it I got more and more into it. This book is not for the faint hearted as the ending is very upsetting.<br /><br /> In conclusion I think this book is very good but at parts it is very hard to understand which is why I given it 4 stars out of 5. -EWAN PARNELL	2015-03-25

Then again, I never thought my first classic would be a story about a group of civilized boys, turning into wild animals. I wanted to understand what the world has been talking about since 1954. When I finally picked up a copy, it didn't take long before I was drawn into the world of these savage school boys.<br /><br />I feel like this book is in the end, all about the hidden meaning and the symbolism. According to the author, no one can survive without any civilization. The savagery of boys like Jack is much stronger than intelligence or knowing the difference between right and wrong, resulting into a remarkable and well-executed evolution. Honestly, the development of going from preppy school boys to bloodthirsty animals is the best part of the entire book. Unbelievable or not, I was still kind of fascinated when events started to take a turn. After all, scared kids aren't the same as adult leaders. They tried to find their way towards responsibility and obedience, as it was clear how they tried to solve their problems. One way or another, their fear took over.<br /><br />Blood was spilled more quickly than I imagined and the weirdness factor began to increase at an alarming amount. The vivid writing style helped a lot in adding that touch of gore to a book I already found to be disturbing. In the end, it wasn't as horrific as I expected it to be. Also some parts felt unnecessary and a bit confusing for me, and others were just hard to follow.<br /><br />I didn't particularly feel much attachment to any of the characters besides Piggy. It was obvious he was going to be the loser from the moment he and Ralph met. I can't help but secretly love an underdog. Though he too stood for a specific value, he felt more developed and real to me than any other character in this book. Apart from all the other ones whose personalities looked so alike, there were only a few I could properly distinguish.<br /><br />Lord of the Flies was a very slow read for me, despite the fact that is was a thin novel. There no doubt about the excellent symbolism and development to savages, but unfortunately, I look for more in a book than just those two aspects. Not my cup of tea.<br /><br />Lord of the Flies was a very slow read for me, despite the fact that is was a thin novel.

In some ways it remembers me of the movie called \\"Cast Away\\" that starred Tom Hanks. How a group of students' age's ranges from 6 to 12 have a plane crashed and end up on an uncharted island. There are not adult present for the child aid, so now they must figure out to make a civilization. By electing leader on the groups and etc. by what they see in their own society. They started to believe in other gods. They also started to kill one each to offer their god sacrifice. The book really shows the flaws in society, also the nature of human to do in a crisis situation it.  I dislike this book due to the violate nature. Also the many believe that they have in the nature of man I really don't agree with. It was still interesting book but it was something that I really disagree with many of the thoughts it had with book. I wouldn't recommend this book cause the author outlook on society I really disagree with his thoughts and I thought it was really inaccuracy on the flaws of man.	2015-03-19

In the wake of a nuclear war	My book club recently read William Golding's Lord of the Flies (New York: Penguin, 1954), and this discussion confirmed that it still tops my list of all-time favorite books!<br /><br />In the wake of a nuclear war, a group of school boys are being evacuated from England when their aircraft  is shot down and lands on an isolated tropical island with no adult presence.  They have to fend for themselves.  Ultimately the children form two rival gangs and soon cross the line from civilization to savagery.<br /><br />William Golding is a worthy Nobel Laureate.  This - his first novel - is a finely crafted psychological study of the inherent evil that dwells within us all.  Therefore, the Lord of the Flies can be interpreted from many interesting and valid perspectives, each new reading adding another harrowing dimension.  The build-up of suspense is taut and unsparing, Golding's command of language incredibly precise, and his innate understanding of the human condition is ultimately quite convincing.  Although shocking and terrifying, it is also a beautiful read.  The perfect novel!	2015-03-14

Don't go into this expecting a ton of violence and action, there is some, but there is also a deeper story here. I've read books like The Hunger Games, and there was more violence in that book than this one, but you get more complex dialogue and a story here that is a lot deeper in meaning. My main issue is that these deeper meanings were not overly obvious to me, and the average reader like myself isn't going to take the time to sit and study the book. I read to relax, not to do research and find complex meaning. Overall, I am glad I read the book, it is haunting, but not really in an overly violent way. It sticks with you because you know that it is a study on human nature at it's core, and for that I give this book an easy 5 stars!	2015-02-24

Although I sometimes have to restrain myself from thinking of it as Heart of Darkness for juveniles I also appreciate what I understand to be William Golding's point in making them children which was to have people who were less shaped by society and thus more on the nature side of the nature-nuture continuum.<br /><br />The book is generally quite good.  Golding gives a good sense of place and the various plot resolution scenes, especially the hunt at the end, are well done and engaging.  One does need to suspend a measure of disbelief in accepting the plot point that a group of boys with a maximum age of about 12 or 13 would just happen to have the skills to survive on the island.  The overall story, that boys marooned on an island try to maintain an orderly society but that they ultimately decay into savage anarchy, is a convincing one and its evolution is handled well.  For example, I liked how Jack Merridew, the head of the &#34;hunters&#34; and the main symbol for the idea of the id rampant, first starts out being unable to kill the first wild pig he sees and eventually becomes the most feral of the lot.<br /><br />Particularly clever is the use of the &#34;beast&#34;, a fearsome creature ostensibly seen by one of the younger boys (littuns) who is used as an excuse by Jack to eventually split off with his hunters, using the idea of dealing with the beast as an excuse.  This development is a clever tool for developing the type of fear that can breakdown a society, with the survival imperative superseding the need to adhere to its rules.<br /><br />The characters work but they seem two-dimensional.  Perhaps the worst offender is Piggy.  He is the smartest of the group and the one with the greatest adherence to the idea of an ordered society.  However, he is also fat, asthmatic, can't see without his glasses and seems a typical uber-nerd.	2015-02-02

When I began reading Lord of the Flies by William Golding, I had an open mind like I do when I begin any book, but I quickly found that I did not like it.  The theme itself was the main reason.  My teacher told my class that the theme was that left to our own devises, humans are evil.  I strongly disagree.  I am the kind of person that trusts others and believes that people are truly good, so reading a book that tells me that I am wrong just upset me.  But, even though the novel wasn't great for me, I did like some aspects of the writing.  For example, I likes that Golding kept the boys acting and thinking like kids through the story, this made it seem much more realistic.  So, if you are like me and believe in the goodness in everyone, and you don't want to read something that tells you otherwise, this probably isn't the book for you.  But, if you are okay with the theme and are looking for a realistic survival novel about young boys with an unexpected and somewhat ironic ending, this will definitely be a great read for you.	2015-01-29

Will human children retain the civilized social mores of their society or will they give into the natural propensities of the \\"flight or fight\\" primitive reptilian brain?\\"  William Golding novel, Lord of the Flies examines this fascinating dilemma in his disturbing yet sobering story that harkens back to Charles Darwin's idea of survival of the fittest, where only the strong survive when set in an environment absent of social rules.<br /><br />Golding's tale of well-bred, privileged young boys stranded on an island together, san adults or adult rules, is a clever demonstration of humanity's propensity for aggression, tribalism, and territorial behavior. These are deep-seated instincts that society attempts to socialize out of our young. The test is to discover if they will come together as a  group and use all that they have been taught to pull together to survive together. However, instead of working as one social group, these boys slowly devolve into aggression, tribalism, and violence as their savage nature comes forth in the game of survival and power. Obviously, there is no blaming maladaptive behaviors on the tired trope that, \\"the devil made me do it.\\" It turns out that the brain function of primitive instinct is, apparently, the most powerful of coping mechanism when chaos and free will reigns supreme.<br /><br />Stark and haunting, this gem of a story is sobering in its look into the baser side of human nature.	2015-01-28

It is in its own way so real, yet so unbelievable.  Not only did it give me a thrilling adventure, the ideas portrayed in it changed my perspective on the human race itself. It lead me into the depths of humans, and showed me that every one has evil and anger stored inside them, and when we have no order, this evil runs free. I realized that no humans are truly innocent, because our race has already made to many mistakes. William Golding allows you to explore into the depths of human nature, and what you find you find is so disturbing, it changes your perspective on the human race. Through taking you on a journey where innocent kids become murders and savages, you see the true extent of evil that can arise when there is no order. Anyone who likes to explore the unknown of our world, would love this book.	2015-01-16

Parts of the story are a little graphic, but it is necessary to show the disintegration of civilization which is taking place.

Only 25 kids stranded on a island with no adults, as the Naval Officer stated could there have been &#34;a better show&#34; expected from this? What got me so hooked on the books was the way the characters tried to make peace between each other so they could coexist till help arrived. But that Conch's dominance could not allow the S.O.S. importance uncontested, which later sparked heated arguments and more. I think the saddest part was when Roger start hallucinating, becoming mad and chasing Piggy. The most unexpected part is how the book ends, man that plot twist!

They are alone, with no grownups to tell them what to do.  How do they live?  Who leads?  Who resolves conflicts?  Who survives?<br /><br />Ralph is only twelve, but he’s a natural leader and the boys vote him chief.  Jack is strong and wants to hunt.  Piggy is smart, but he’s fat, asthmatic and nearly blind without his glasses.  And most of the boys, especially Jack, hate Piggy for his weaknesses.<br />Lord of the Flies is the ultimate story of group dynamics.  It’s both engrossing and frightening to see the boys struggle with the enormous stresses of survival and the additional problems of trying to govern themselves.  They come up with impressive ideas and seem to be off to a good start.  But as time passes, Ralph and Jack emerge as competing leaders.  Their system begins to crack when priorities alternate in importance.  While Jack and his hunters care only about killing pigs, Ralph knows that keeping the fire is most important.  As Ralph clings to the hope of being rescued, Jack immerses himself in the strategies of the hunt.  Amid questions of leadership and the fear of a mysterious beast, Ralph and Jack position themselves for power and control.  No spoilers here, but what follows is an alarming descent, full of savagery and devoid of morals.<br /><br />I really enjoyed rereading Lord of the Flies.  It’s a great example of how groups break down under stress, how power can shift between people, and how the difference between right and wrong is either held onto or altogether ignored.  While the story would be interesting with a group of adults, placing children in the situation instead shows the how the behavior develops regardless of age.  And the loss of innocence makes the story all the more intense and sad.<br /><br />Golding has included a great combination of characters, with plenty of conflict and things to think about. I especially like the friendship between Ralph and Piggy, how it starts and how it changes.  Simon is the one I think about the most.  He is weak, but he's prophetic and I still want the boys to pay more attention to him.  In addition to these characters, one of the most interesting things Golding shows is how there’s a whole group of boys who are just along for the ride. They don’t seem to care either way what decisions are made – they just follow the one in power. It’s easy to make that parallel to group situations around us, both large and small.  You can just roll your eyes when the situation is an ordinary one, but just imagine when it's a matter of survival.<br /><br />I got a lot more out of this book the second time around and I give this excellent story five stars for its timeless relevance.ut.

Granted, they subtextual elements in this story are wonderful, but when you take this book at face value, you run into some problems. Namely, it is boring. It is a very slow to develop book with TOO MUCH DESCRIPTION! I didn't enjoy the story of the book, but at the very least I can respect this book.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />Like I said before, the subtext was beautiful. Everything was a symbol, and figuring out what the symbolical purpose of each character was like a very intricate puzzle where each piece fits into numerous other pieces. Once you get through all the symbols, this book is about the evil that every person has inside of them, and no matter what, when given the chance, a person will always be evil.<br />The characters were pretty cool. I enjoyed Ralph's persona the most because he was democracy. He was the fair boy on the island -both physically and symbolically.<br />Having said that I liked Ralph, Jack never ceased to entertain me. Him and his clique were so outlandish wight their beliefs and actions that you can't help but have fun reading about him.<br />The way the Golding made fear such a big part of the island was fascinating. I have never read a book where fear became the sole motivator for all of the character's actions. Everything that they did had to do with being scared of the beastie which did end up just being an embodiment of the boys on the island.<br />The Bad:<br />The plot of the book was B-O-R-I-N-G!! Literally nothing happened until about chapter 5 when they had their council meeting. It was just not something that interested me.<br />The side characters just faded into the background. Simon, Samneric, Piggy, Jack and Ralph were the only characters that were helpful in moving the story along. All the others were just painted savages or littluns. And even then, the littluns maybe talked once if they even had that. Most of them didn't even have a name, much less a start to a  personality..

US	34576424	R332OQVCCICIKS	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	4	0	0	N	N	My favorite part of the book was in the second chapter ...	What would you do if you were stranded on an island with no adults or means of escaping the island?  Lord of the Flies is a book about a group of young British boys who crash land on an island.  They must create their own society and rules to survive.  As the story progresses, Golding characterizes the main characters to represent the idealism and faults in human nature and in society today.  Ralph is the main protagonist of the story and starts as the leader of the boys.  He talks of the importance of being rescued and how essential it is to keep the smoke signal going in case of passing ships.  Jack represents the opposite of Ralph.  He is a symbol of savagery and insanity.  At the start of the book, the boys organize and start to build shelters, start fires, and gather food.  As the story unfolds, however, the boys begin to lose sight of the norms of society and what is, or should be, morally correct. Eventually, the violence and corruption instigated by Jack causes the murder of two of the boys, as well as the attempted murder of Ralph.  The novel ends with Ralph fleeing from the group of boys led by Jack to ‘hunt’ him.  Ralph runs into a naval officer and is consequently rescued from the hellish island.<br /> I would rate this book a seven out of ten.  This book was very intriguing but sometimes difficult to interpret.  Golding was able to capture the flaws of human nature in an eerie struggle of power.  Lord of the Flies broadened my perspective on human nature and our society as a whole.<br /> My favorite part of the book was in the second chapter when Ralph first organizes the boys and decides to build a fire to send a smoke signal.  They go up to the mountain and are excited at the prospect of doing something productive and immediately begin.  I enjoy this part of the book because it gives hope for their future.  It also symbolizes the need for productivity and creativity in human nature, as well as the power of cooperation and companionship.  This is one of the few instants in the book when they are working in tandem and enjoying each other’s presences.<br /> My least favorite part of the Lord of the Flies was when Simon was killed.  Simon was a young boy who represented genuine kindness and moral goodness in human nature.  Jack decided to hold a dance for his tribe and pretended to be on a pig hunt.  As the dance became more and more frenzied, they enclosed around poor Simon and killed him.  After his murder, Ralph and his companions pretended it did not happen and that they were absent when it occurred.  I find this part very infuriating because of the injustice and cruelty represented in Jack and his companions, as well as in Ralph.<br /> I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in psychology or human nature.  It is a very well written book and exemplifies the struggle of sanity and lunacy.  Lord of the Flies is a fairly challenging book to read because of the author’s use of words and writing style.  It was written in 1954 and is written using old British terms and phrases.  It is very unique from books that were published recently and offers a different perspective on issues in society today.  It is a great book and is worthy of its title as a literary classic.ne of the few instants in the book when they are working in tandem and enjoying each other’s presences.<br /> My least favorite part of the Lord of the Flies was when Simon was killed.

I hate to say it, but despite its importance in the world of literature, I absolutely despised this novel. I like a story with a happy ending, or at least one with a glimmer of brightness in the dark. My glimmer was murdered by the end of the book (I mean both an actual character and figuratively). I believe this book is the reason I never again finished a required reading book until I reached college. I suppose it's silly to blame such a thing on a book, but I do so anyway. I realize I'm in the minority here; most people seem to love this book and the movie adaptation. Perhaps I'll read it again someday, and perhaps I'll then enjoy it. Truly, though, I doubt it.	2014-11-17

However,  it is the plot here that is so powerful and strong which is why this book is so well known.

This novel that has charmed schoolchildren for decades I think the reason of that the symbology in the book.<br />The story begins with right after a plane crash. And the schoolboys have survived the crash and find themselves on a desert island without any adult with them. The boy Ralph, leads the other kids, is assigning responsibilities for each one and he knows little more than the others. Stands with him, clever Piggy. Ralph’s election is opposed by Jack, the other boy who has the capability of leadership. And Simon, symbolises pure kindness, foreseeing boy. The other one, Roger, pure nefariousness.<br />Under the leadership of Ralph, the plan is lightning a fire for to escape from the island. After a while, Jack can not accept not being a leader and things changes. They accidentally kill one of the boys because they set part of the island on fire and after that they are separated into two groups. They hunt, kill pigs and start dancing absurdly after killing something.<br /><br />There is a few things that we should understand in this book. One of them is what it really means to be immoral and the true meaning of evil. It makes us to realise how thin is the line between pure goodness and evil.<br /><br />I enjoyed finally getting to read this classic and slowly discovering the meanings behind certain things. I also appreciated the symbolism of the characters. Overall, Lord of the Flies is an extremely readable book.<br />Enjoy!	2014-10-26

Personally, I find the book so dark, so difficult to process the horrors of that island, of what the boys go through.  Golding holds a detached authorial  lens over these boys as they go about their business and we readers are spellbound and peer in closer as  those creatures begin to crisp and panic under the intensified heat of the sun.  Know it's a classic.  Know it's a commentary on our own lot.  Know that through Ralph we can glimpse hope.  Know that the deus ex machina appearance of the naval officer and his inability to see that this was more than a game dims that hope.  Grateful that my fall teaching assignment changed at the 11th hour and I can put this one back on the shelf for a time.	2014-08-09

Golding is a fantastic novelist, and he shows his skills the most through this book.  His book shows how there is no one government that can control and keep people civilized.  There is always an evil resting in each and every individual, but in this case, young boys.  Golding does well portraying the different kinds of government roles through characters.  Ralph is the protagonist of the story and is a born leader.  His peaceful attitude and strong focus on his main goal, rescue, shows his leadership in the group of young boys.  Piggy, Ralph's sidekick, uses his intellect to give ideas to Ralph and keep the group in a civilized orientation.  Jack with his group of hunters is the strong, militarized side of civilization.  For a while, things on the island are kept in order, until the savagery escalates within the boys.  Golding did a great choice for the characters on the island to be pre-adolescent boys, because they are between the ages of maturity and recklessness found in young boys.  Jack is the first to fall; he separates from Ralph's group and creates his own tribe where he is the chief.  Most of the boys follow him and begin to accept their savage nature.  Even Ralph and Piggy fall into savagery one night when they began to dance and chant with Jack's group.  One boy did not however, Simon.  Simon was represented as the goodness of humankind through his actions with the littluns and by trying to warn everyone of the dangers of the Lord of the Flies.  The Lord of the Flies, the representation of the evil within humans, taunts Simon and says if he warns the others of his presence then &#34;we shall do you.&#34;  This was a foreshadowing of Simon's death in the next chapter.  Simon's death showed that the innocence of Jack and his followers were no more, and they became the brutal savages that their instincts give into.  Ralph was the only one to oppose Jack and, in doing so, killed Piggy in the process.  Roger, one of Jack's most trusted followers, is the most brutal of the group and is the one who kills Piggy.  This shows that Roger is a representation of the savageness of mankind.  In the end, Ralph is chased by the savages to the beach where they finally meet their rescue.  This is a sorrowful moment, because Ralph now knows the capacity of mankind's evil and cries because of this knowledge.  There were a couple of things in the story that were not satisfactory though.  One, Jack and Roger never really received punishment for the cruel acts they committed on the island, besides the guilt they must live with now.  Two, Golding does not give a solution to mankind's evil instincts.  As shown in the story, a civilized life and atmosphere cannot keep savagery away, and even a visual representation of the evil was ignored by most of the boys.  But all in all, Lord of the Flies is a very well written book, and everyone should read this book for it's creative symbolism and allegorical plot.ages that their instincts give into.

The writing was excellent and easy to understand. It has 202 pages and I read it with ease (in one day!!). The plot line was excellent and so was the killer suspense. There was so many metaphors it was crazy. And that's a good thing. It really made me think and question society. There was a ton of foreshadowing which was done to perfection. My only problem was that I wish there was a different ending. I'm not going to give any spoilers so I won't say more about that. If you have read it, tell me your thoughts. Overall it was a classic and I would recommend it to anyone.	2014-08-05

Ralph, the protagonist, represents civilization—the ideas and morals given by society that surrounds us, teaching us to overcome the sinful instincts we all struggle with. Jack, the antagonist, represents the human desire to leave what is known to be right and fall into chaos and total savagery, even to the point of finding no fault in taking a human life. Golding vividly depicts the battle between savagery and civilization.<br /><br />The character of Ralph portrays leadership and authority. His character gives the reader a feeling of hope with his desire to keep the boys in a civil mindset. He does what he can to add to the hope of being rescued from the island by keeping a fire lit at all times—during the day as a signal fire, and through the night for comfort from the darkness. Ralph believes the fire is their only hope of rescue, a way for passing ships or planes to see the smoke coming from the island.<br /><br />Jack, however, has a starkly different character than Ralph. He portrays dictatorship and power by forming his own group of hunters and eventually dictating everyone on the island. Jack is able to force his power on everyone except Ralph, and everyone is under his reign. He is also able to somewhat overcome Ralph, because Ralph is the only one who has not fallen into barbarism and the only one who is not under Jack’s reign. The story does not end that way, however. Ralph is eventually rescued by a naval officer while running to save his life from Jack’s tribe. Jack becomes so consumed with hunting and becomes extremely bloodthirsty, that he murders Simon because he believes he is the “beast” in disguise that lives on the island.<br /><br />Simon’s character is even more different than the others. His is the only “good” character, the only one unchanged by society. He is the first to believe that the “beast” they have been terrified of actually exists in all of them, and is not some horrific monster that inhabits the island. Simon’s kind personality adds goodness and a stark contrast to Ralph and Jack’s personality that is molded by society.<br /><br />The theme of the novel is the battle between living by society’s ideas of law and order and the struggle with falling prey to the natural instinct in all humans to lean toward violence, bloodlust, and desire for power. This book was very well written, well-constructed, and gives a clear picture of what might happen if man did leave behind what is morally right. Although there were a few incidents that did seem overbearing in grossly visualizing the act of murder, this novel would appeal to anyone who enjoys the constant mind work of connecting the meanings of many symbols. Golding gives hope to mankind, because although Ralph was alone and hunted by the others, he was also the only one that did not fall into Jack’s leadership and he was eventually rescued from the demise of civilization. In this way, Golding gives hope, or a way of escape, for mankind. This is not a pessimistic novel. It just deeply shows the inner savagery that lies beneath the hearts of all human beings.society.

In 200 pages it accomplishes what so many works of art try and fail to do. The same problems of Golding's era are the same ones today. Lord of the Flies brings to new light the atrocities and failings of mankind as not exceptions and horrors, but the hidden norm that only the rules and structure of society can contain. In many ways, Ralph, the symbol of civilization and rational thought, perhaps is not as accurate a picture of true human nature as is Jack, the symbol of primal instinct and buried characteristics. Whether one buys into that theory or not, the ease at which Golding forces us to consider it is what makes this book so recognized. By creating a microcosm of our world, he eliminates all the clutter and distraction and focuses attention on the biggest aspect of modern life without straying from the plot for a moment.<br /><br /> This book is a staple of Western education because it hits home on so many elements of modern life in such a simple, understandable way. With each new generation of readers, the same themes are discussed again and again, but there lies a continuing need to contextualize that discussion. In a world of constant connectivity, violence, and opportunity, what does this book mean now? In Golding's time it was a commentary on man in the aftermath of the most destructive wars of all time. Now, it is a commentary on the endless struggle humanity faces to rise above the easy paths of being Ralph like, (following the rules and maintaining order), or being Jack like, (ignoring the rules of society and doing whatever one desires). Even Piggy represents another way of living that is not quite enough on its own. He symbolizes a purely logical, rational, and scientific thought about the world, which holds great merit, but falls without the support of human emotion.<br /><br />Perhaps the character that we must look to in the modern day is Simon, who represents the genuine good in people. He is caring, selfless, and works for both himself and others. HE works to build a community, not to create one. Lord of the Flies says many things about the wrongs of our way of living, but it also subtly points the way to what we can strive for. Instead of placing those who are like Simon in a category of mediocrity, we should realize that it is only through the infusion of compassion in everything we do will we be able to become more than a collection of ideals, and rather the embodiment of them.ay is Simon, who represents the genuine good in people.

Although being made of children, the society described is in many aspects realistic and plausible. Golding is quite skilled in the exercise of describing anarchy slowly destroying this newly formed hierarchy, and former friends turning into (deadly ?) foes.<br /><br />However, despite all of this, I have to say that the story takes quite a while to become really interesting, and those who enjoy action should not expect to see much in the first half of the book, which I personally found a little boring.<br /><br />That being said, I advise anyone to read it once : it is quite short, doesn't take a lot of time to read, and it's definitely a classic.	2014-06-05

Lord of the Flies by William Golding<br />Reviewed by Matt Frank<br /> April 30, 2014<br />While fear and violence are touchy subjects when it comes to children in books, William Golding nails it just right in Lord of the Flies. Golding is primarily known for his fiction, and Lord of the Flies was clearly his greatest piece. He received many awards including a Nobel Prize in Literature for his fable Lord of the Flies. It exploits the capacities for good and evil in human beings using various symbols for different aspects of human nature. Golding uses his skills in literature to go to the dark side of human nature to reveal what we do not want to know about ourselves.<br />At the start of the adventure, a plane has crashed on an island and roughly 15-20 children survive, no adults. Quickly they attempt to establish a social government for themselves, or a tribe, to be able to enjoy their time while pursuing rescue. While they had the right idea, the tribe leader Ralph’s authority is challenged and it becomes a struggle for control over the tribe. A tale of savagery ensues as the children struggle for power of the small island. We soon find out it is not them who own the island, but their fear. The mind can alter a human being into something they never imagined they could become and create a shift in their character. That is what happens on the island and it allows the reader to have a more in-depth understanding of the characters and of the novel as a whole.<br />A good fiction story is one that leaves the reader with a sense of excitement while giving them an understanding of life or people around them. It may not always be good thing, but it must change the outlook of the reader. I enjoyed Lord of the Flies because it accomplished that feat in many ways. I was allowed to use my imagination and clash along side the characters against fear and even each other. The symbolism is remarkable starting with the title to various objects, and even the island as a whole. The evil is represented in the title as Lord of the Flies in Hebrew is a translation of the prince of demons, Beelzebub. If that is not enough to foreshadow you of the tale to come, then I do not know what will.<br />The use of children and their unshaped minds allows Golding to exemplify how the brain can change in circumstances of survival. Without bias and a full understanding of morality, we can perceive a greater knowledge of how we ourselves have a capability of evil. Lord of the Flies is definitely a personal favorite of mine due to the same reasons it is challenged among parents and educational institutes. I have never before enjoyed symbolism as much as I have in this book and I took something out of it, unlike numerous other books I have read. I’m hoping you give yourself a chance to experience the same results as I have by picking up this book for your next read!e evil is represented in the title as Lord of the Flies in Hebrew is a translation of the prince of demons, Beelzebub.

Lord of the Flies is definitely a personal favorite of mine due to the same reasons it is challenged among parents and educational institutes. I have never before enjoyed symbolism as much as I have in this book and I took something out of it, unlike numerous other books I have read. I’m hoping you give yourself a chance to experience the same results as I have by picking up this book for your next read!	2014-05-02

The description of the book was that it was in good condition. However, there is highlighting in many of the pages....which is distracting for a student who may be learning other essential lines in the book. I ordered this one because the seller said nothing about highlighting/underlining. I thought it was a clean book...meaning no writing in it!!! This was not the case. Also, see the cover which is white background with a fly...well, the cover on our book is totally different. Now, I know the cover does not change the contents. But, again, the description on Amazon was incongruent to what I received!! I purchased this for a school assignment. I wanted the same cover as what the teacher recommended and no where in the description of this book did they say there was underling/highlighting (other book descriptions indicated there was highlighting...did not buy from them). This one said nothing about highlighting...I want my money back and I will return this book. I was trying to save a bit. Very disappointing!	2014-04-13

The story will stick with you for a long time and there is a timeless message hidden within the pages.  Even though I never read this in high school, this is defiantly a high school level book.  The reading is quick and easy once you get into it, just the plot might slow you down.  Everyone should read though if you want to understand great usage of motifs, foreshadowing, allusions to mythology, and get certain references from several books, movies, and television shows.<br /><br />The main reason I started this book now was one I never read it before and two I have read all the Hunger Games.  Yes, Hunger Games is like Battle Royale, but they are both extremely close to Lord of the Flies as well.  Another reason I read this was that I heard Fables refers to it in the Animal Farm story arch, not just the pigs head on a stick, but the fact only one person can hear the “Lord of the Flies” talk to them.  So, I went all Fables Fangirl at that part of the book.  I must say I also was constantly thinking about the Simpsons’ episode were the kids are stranded on a disserted island.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked the book.  It was somewhat predictable at times, but I think that was mainly due to the fact the book has been referenced so many times.  Not to give anything away but there is a lot of talk about Piggy’s glasses and how if he ever lost them.  At times, the dialogue was a little difficult to follow, but I just had to figure out who was talking when.  This is more of a personal issue, but authors need to stop stereotyping twins so much.  We are not the same person and makes it hard for me to follow books when they make them Samneric all the time.<br /><br />I think my favorite character in the book was Piggy.  Right away, you just get a sense of feeling for him and you just want him to stand up for himself.  Ralph you get the feeling he is a complete jerk and you know he is going to be the main villain of the story.  I mean he calls Piggy by his nickname, when Piggy tell him not to call him that.  Although, Piggy was stupid for even trusting Ralph in the first place, as most innocent kids when they meet bad friends.  Clearly, Piggy just wanted a friend.<br /><br />This is the type of book I could go on and on with in my review, but I’m not going to or I know I give away spoilers to those who are living under a rock and never even heard about this book.  As I previously said before, this is a book everyone should rad no matter what types of books you like to read.  I very much recommend it to those who read Battle Royale and Hunger Games though.

The characters he created were so real and each had their own individual characteristics about them. The individuality in this book ranged from a single leader to a psychotic rebel who completely lost his mind. Just imagine a plane full of school children crashing into a deserted island with no adults there to assure them that things will okay and not having any food to survive on. William Golding did an amazing job creating this fictional, but so realistic story.<br />I couldn't stop reading. My eyes kept eating the words right off the page to find out what would happen to these lost children on this foreign island. Ralph, the protagonist, and Jack, the antagonist, were perfectly parallel at one point of the book, slowly but surely they began going their opposite ways. One focused on survival, the other on adaption. The events in this fictional book were so descriptive and colorful in an almost gory kind of  way. This is a must read book!	2014-04-02

Readers are taken on a journey following the lives of a group of schoolboys who are stranded on a deserted tropical island after being the only survivors of a fatal plane crash. Being the only inhabitants of the island, the boys are free from all rules and standards which society formerly imposed upon them. Without any supervision the boys are left to govern themselves. Readers become captivated to see whether the boys’ impulses lead them towards civilization or savagery.<br />At first, the boys follow their human instincts and work together toward civilization, but simultaneously they struggle with the conflicting human instinct to descend into savagery, violence, and chaos. Inevitably, two tribes form with two different leaders and goals to illustrate the difference between civilization and savagery. Ralph’s group wants to build shelters and collect food, whereas Jack’s group would rather have fun and put all of their efforts into hunting. Jack’s tribe ultimately becomes the larger of the two as the boys’ instinct of savagery takes over the instinct of civilization. As time passes, conflicts arise and the tension between the two tribes grows tremendously. The tension causes violent outbreaks and chaos, which ultimately leads to the boys’ complete decline into the natural human instinct of savagery. By the time the boys are rescued, they have lost all innocence and learn that life will never be the same again because the nature of evil will still be a part of them even in the “civilized world.”<br />Lord of The Flies is a fascinating read that forces readers to not only examine the book, but also to look closely at themselves and their civilizations. I enjoyed reading Golding’s novel because it gave me an insight into human nature and the failings of society through a well thought out story with dynamic characters. Readers find themselves so involved in the novel that they cannot help themselves from imagining what they would do if they were put in the same situation.

I am fine with this. I have read dark books before, from Gaiman to the later-written books of the Harry Potter series; To Poe to Orson Scott Card to King, and several other tomes that fill my eyes with tears and my head with thoughts. I enjoy reading these works, for though they are dark and make me despair of humanity, and life and the pain that comes with it, it feels like a mud-bath for the soul; Though messy during the task, afterwards, you feel cleaner and think deeper for it. There is despair, yes, but it makes the triumph (Or grisly ending, in Poe's case) all the sweeter.<br />Golding did not write a book like any of these.<br />Instead, he writes an anvilicious (Look it up on TV Tropes) moralistic slog of why we are all horrible people. His book is like a tar-pit for the soul; It weighs you down, and if you manage to escape, it leaves a grime and a sheen that takes forever to rinse away. From his placid descriptions of the Eden-like island (All but to set it up to be burned to the ground later on, of course) to his outright psychotic characters, this book has brought me no joy, or perspective to humanity. (Other than further justifying my hypothesis that people who write terrible books inevitably get lauded by the academia for it)<br />The characters are stereotypical and infuriating in their actions, the plot-line contrived and based on coincidences, and the tone is cynical and condescending to the average reader. Don't read this book.<br />In fact, if I had a time machine, I would first go and tame a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The, while riding my T-Rex, I would go and punch Mr. Golding in the face.<br />He deserves it.	2014-03-06

A commentary on the mind and heart of man and the struggle between what we can do and what we should do set on an island paradise played out with a rag-tag bunch of boys.<br /><br />What can be said about this classic tale of boys and their hearts. It is a tale as old as time and told in such a way as to last the ages. The struggles between three boys trapped on an island reflects the wars going on in ourselves, but also within society. The intellectuals, the hunters and the leaders all push for dominance and fight for their ways and only one can seemingly win.<br /><br />Every young man should read this book so he can see how the wars inside his head and heart would play out on a desert island. It helps develop the sense of how one should not always follow the desires of the heart or be lead entirely by their head. Neither way is the answer, but rather a balance each and every man must develop on his own must be forged.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to: young men, men, classic enthusiasts, readers and English literature lovers.	2014-02-28

That was the first thought that ran across my mind when I saw this title. I actually had no idea what to expect. Lord of the Flies. The title doesn’t give away much, and the book’s so old the back summary only contained praise. So I plunged straight into a surprise when I began, and I would be lying if I said I loved it right away.<br /><br />Let me inform you what the story is. Maybe this will prevent any more literary ignorance. The Lord of the Flies illustrates a story about a group of boys who get stranded on an island. The island is completely uninhabited, and the boys must learn how to fend for themselves. As time goes by and no rescuers make an appearance, the boys become more and more antsy. Arguments begin and sides are taken. With no adults to calm them, the boys’ antics at playing savage take a turn for the worst.<br /><br />First, I need to make a disclaimer. I have no concept of allegories or symbolism or motifs hidden in stories. It’s ironic, because since I read so much, I should be a little better at this. Sadly, no matter how much practice I’ve had, I still haven’t the faintest idea of the underlying meanings in books.<br /><br />That being said, this one was blatantly obvious. One scene basically summed it all up pretty nicely. The novel shows the loss of innocence, which is especially noticeable towards the end. It also portrays organization vs. chaos. The two sides the children split into represent the difference between order and savagery. One group is concerned with keeping up a smoke signal for ships, and the other has come to terms with their new home and busies themselves with play and hunting. It also demonstrates order is much more difficult to obtain and can be lost faster than chaos. Laying under the stars and eating meat turns out to be much more enjoyable than worrying about shelters and keeping up smoke signals for the boys.<br /><br />I have to say I wasn’t in love with the beginning. It started out slow and confusing. Golding never explained how the children got stuck there, and the multitude of characters without names made it difficult to keep up with events. I even had to Sparknote a chapter towards the middle because I had no idea what was happening. Golding writes in a 3rd person perspective and doesn’t really let the reader connect with any of the characters through anything but actions.<br /><br />The rest of the book, I adored. Once I got past the question how they got stranded (which was never answered), I could enjoy the book much more. Also, after the confusing chapter, the book picked up speed. The boys’ personalities shown through, and the reader began to feel the hopelessness that was edging into the backs of their minds.<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT** (I know, it is old. But you never know who hasn’t read it! I got The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as well as The Great Gatsby spoiled by the same person.)<br /><br />Can we just talk about the deaths in the book? Simon’s death after the scene which explained the deeper meaning in the book killed me. I was horrified the children would literally tear him apart with their bare hands. After his death, the situation became real to me. The boys began to break off into groups and I started to worry about the other characters I liked such as Piggy or Ralph.<br /><br />I was absolutely right to worry. Piggy and Ralph split off from the others, and in a despute, Someone pushed a boulder onto Piggy! From the very beginning I connected with him. He represented the intelligent and rational mind of the kids, and he was so sweet and soft. I could tell from the very first page his death was coming, though.<br /><br />The ending made me just plain sad. I felt so empty after I finished the book. Once the solider rescued Ralph from the other kids hunting him down like a wild pig, everything just stopped. The children, ranging from 5-12, seemed so ridiculous after contact with the outside world. They turned into savages and killed and hunted each other for no real reason.<br /><br />I could just imagine all of them slowly appearing on the outskirts of the trees. Their faces smeared with blood and dirt, and their clothes tattered and filthy. They would look around and realize they can go home, and they’re safe. Then they’ll begin to realize what senile events they’ve gone through and instigated. Those thought will continue to haunt them for the rest of their lives. They have death on their hands. Images of Piggy being crushed and Simon’s small lifeless figure will never leave their minds. All innocence is gone forever.<br /><br />Another symbol was the officer who retrieved the boys. He saved them from a manhunt, but now he’s going to embark on a manhunt just like theirs during the war. The beast inside them all never goes away. The Lord of the Flies is not a live being; it’s a monster which is present inside us all. The children turning to savages represents this idea. Nobody can save you from the monster. It continues whether you reside on a deserted island with children or whether you’re a grown man heading to war.<br /><br />I love books that make me think; this one surely did. Despite the slow start, I grew to love it all the same. The more I think about it, the more I realize how wonderful this book is. Horrifyingly beautiful.<br /><br />[...]e world.

Even now it is being read in countless schools across the nation. A timeless classic, Lord of the Flies explores the depths of civilization, digging down to the core values of humanity. It follows the story of a group of children and their descent into savagery as they battle with the forces of good and evil.<br /><br />Lord of the Flies has caused quite some controversy over the years. Some criticize it for being dark and including &#34;gruesome imagery&#34; at points. While that may hold true to some extent, the literary value of this novel far surpasses any negatives, such as violence, it may contain. As Common Sense Media said, &#34;Parents need to know that Lord of the Flies has been described as dark, brutal, pessimistic, and tragic. Yet it deals with a fundamental issue of humanity... This and other issues in this novel would be invaluable for parent-child discussion, on both theological and humanist levels.&#34; According to Salve Regina University, a study was done in 1964 that showed more than 95% of public schools either had or were using this book. Lord of the Flies is a novel that draws out timeless themes through an outstanding display of breathtaking details, colorful vocabulary, and meaningful symbols.	2014-02-03

(Preface: This review is part of an extra-credit school assignment about whether classic books, such as LoTF, should be banned or not and why, so if the following seems a little different from an average Amazon product review, that's why.) :)<br /><br />Lord of the Flies: Why It Should Not Be Banned<br /><br />Reading William Golding’s famous novel Lord of the Flies recently was a fabulous experience.  Its chronicles of friendship, betrayal, and the battle between civilization/”goodness” and man’s inner evil were both thrilling and intriguing. I read the book for a school assignment, and I must say that I was sorry that I had not read it earlier. It’s fascinating, and a great read for anyone above the age of 10 (there are a few gruesome scenes and images that may scare younger readers). Still, the violence is far from too graphic for middle-school students – for them the pros of reading the book outweigh the cons. Lord of the Flies is an extremely well-written tale with intriguing plots and ideas. Young teenagers should read the book because it teaches about human nature, and because censoring literature that teaches morals in an intense way is not censoring’s purpose.<br />William Golding’s novel Lord of the Flies is one of the best books on human nature ever written. In the story, British schoolboys crash on an island in the middle of the ocean. They try to create a sort of makeshift society, but due to the lack of parental supervision, it breaks down and results in anarchy – several of the boys die due to the chaos that ensues. By reading the story, children will learn about how the human psyche works – and how dependent we are on society. Lord of the Flies is an incredible book that contains many important things – some of these being civilization vs. savagery, individualism vs. community, the nature of evil, man vs. nature, dehumanization of relationship, the loss of innocence, and the negative outcomes of war. (What an incredible list – would anyone deprive a middle-schooler of knowledge on these profound topics simply because of one scene that is a little graphic?) Lord of the Flies is a novel of profound messages, themes, and morals, and censoring is not worth missing out on learning from the book.<br />A second reason why Lord of the Flies should not be banned is that doing so would defy the purpose of censoring books. When a board or organization bans a book, they are doing so logically because the book that they are banning has little or no literary value. Of course, Golding’s novel is far from that – as mentioned, it’s a work of literary genius with countless themes and lessons. Why ban a book and deprive students of such learning because of one scene? Teachers can allow students to skip the graphic parts, as many have done in my school. Besides, even if students choose to read even the scarier scenes, they are reading about human nature – they’re not watching a horror movie with pointless, excessive violence that has no meaning or point for its existence. Lord of the Flies may have gruesome parts, but those parts are educational and only help shine Golding’s messages brighter.<br />In conclusion, The Lord of the Flies should be taught in school, because of its incredible literary and moral value, and because censoring it would defeat the purpose of censoring books in the first place.middle-schooler of knowledge on these profound topics simply because of one scene that is a little graphic?)

It truly show how mankind in its roots will revert to evil, and it is not easy to control that evil. Even what dwells within will not be easily controlled, and how it shows it in such description that creates a perfect atmosphere. Golding’s use of figurative language makes the story feel as if you were really there. He also describes it through a child’s perspective which creates it in such a different atmosphere compared to you or I would see it as. From what I’ve heard about it being inappropriate, I completely disagree with it all. Any gory or gruesome scenes only make the story more in depth, which creates a more beautiful story. The lose only pulls you more into the story, although you shouldn’t read it until your about nine or ten, but it just depends on your level of maturity. I wouldn’t buy it for your five year old, but maybe you’re eight year old if he/she is mature enough for the book. Lord of the Flies is a beautiful story, I would suggest everyone to read it, even twice to truly grasp everything. 10/10	2014-01-29

This book is not beneficial to the children in any way.	2014-01-29

I understand the need to establish mood but I didn't care much about the vegetation etc.<br />I'd say this book should be read by all before their 15th birthday. Some books need to be fed to our youth so they can actually learn morality etc. Someone once said &#34;Religion highjacked morality&#34; and that is a tragedy b/c morality needs to stand alone w/out the religious trappings.<br />I think all boys should read this book before they grow up; the sooner the better.	2014-01-27

Summative Statement<br /> When reading Lord of The Flies, I found it difficult to close the book and put it down. William Golding creates a suspenseful, yet haunting fictional novel with a plot unlike any other. He takes readers to an island where “survival of the fittest” is put into effect with a group of innocent schoolboys.<br /> Character development in the beginning of the novel sets the stage for possible friendships and foreshadows possible rivalries. The division between Jack and Ralph establishes the division between civility and disorder. Jack is a personification of mans natural instinct when faced with the concept of survival. Ralph and the conch symbolize the necessity of order and rules.<br /> Golding creates a disturbing and cynical tale that strips the innocence of children, leaving them to fulfill their true desires concerning survival. I would recommend this book to anyone who can stomach the idea of a hunger games for children. Golding’s unique plot will enlighten you, and form a newfound appreciation for societal rules.	2014-01-18
US	24888388	R2EK1FABBWWWSI	B004O2F82U	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Great Book	Lord of the Flies is a 1950’s novel by Nobel Prize winning author William Golding. The book has won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1983. Lord of the Flies shows that if we leave our civilization, humans can become very barbaric and inhuman just to live another day. We will do just about anything, if it means that we can save ourselves from dying. It is a long story about how some school children become stranded on an island, and must find a way to escape without turning on each other. They must work together to survive, and find a way not to fight with each other. This book takes place on a deserted tropical island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The island is very dark, and always seems to be alive. The boys feel that the island is cursed, and that it is almost making them go crazy.<br /><br />Ralph is an athletic, and rather charismatic. In the beginning, he was elected the leader of the group. Ralph is very logical, and thinks more than most of the other characters. Instead of acting before thinking, he thinks before he acts. On the other hand, Jack is almost the opposite of him. He was running up against Ralph in the election, but he hadn’t won. Ralph had named him leader of the hunters.  Jack and Ralph always have thought of each other as rivals, so they have always competed with each other. Jack is savage, and will always kill even before he thinks. Both of them have a mutual disliking of each other, and they tend to fight with each other.<br /><br />Lord of the Flies starts off when a group of British schoolboys are flying away from England to escape from a war. The plane was shot down over the ocean. The schoolboys survived, but the pilot was nowhere to be found.  They find themselves trapped on a deserted island. After crashing, all of the boys begin to scatter all about the island. Ralph and Piggy are introduced together. Ralph is an athletic and muscular boy, and Piggy is obese and has asthma. They are wondering where all of the other boys went, when Piggy finds a conch shell in the lagoon. Ralph blows on the conch shell, hoping that all of the other boys come to them. Just about all of the boys come to the beach, where a meeting is held. Ralph notices that there are boys of all ages and sizes. There are little ones, known as littluns, and big ones, known as biguns. Ralph, Jack, and Simon, a small boy, explore the island. The boys are able to create a fire using Piggy’s glasses, but when they do not pay attention to it, the fire engulfs some of the island. A small boy is lost during the fire, and he is nowhere to be found. Ralph and Jack begin to butt heads, when Ralph says that they should focus on maintaining the fire, while Jack says that they should hunt. One morning when Ralph and Piggy see a ship sailing off in the distance, they go look in horror to see that Jack and his hunters have let the signal fire burn out.<br /><br />Ralph tells Jack off, and Jack proposes that he should be chief, but no one will vote him chief. Ralph calls for a meeting, where many littluns are having some nightmares about a beast that lurks on the island. The biguns convince them that there are no such beasts, and they tell them to move on. That night, some military planes engage in battle over the island. A parachutist who is dead slowly falls down on to the island. The twins Sam and Eric, who fell asleep tending the fire, woke up to see the silhouette. They rush back to camp, telling everyone that they saw the monster that the littluns were talking about. Every boy organizes into hunting groups to search for the monster. Ralph and Jack travel up the mountain together. When they see the person, they think that it is some sort of deformed ape. Back at the camp, Jack claims Ralph is a coward, and he runs off to form a new tribe, and calls people to join him. Later, Jack’s group kills a sow, decapitates its head, and places it on a stick for an offering to the beast. Simon later encounters the Lord of the Flies, and believes that it is talking to him. It tells him that he can never escape, and that he exists within all men. As tensions rise between the two tribes, everyone must watch their backs. The children become bloodthirsty, and act savage. Ralph’s tribe and Jack’s tribe begin to fight, with both sides hoping to not only survive, but escape this island.<br /><br />William Golding’s Lord of the Flies shows us what we can become if we are not in an orderly civilization. His use of Old English can make the book difficult to understand, so it can be a very challenging book. This is a phenomenal book and I highly recommend this book for readers who are up for a challenge.t it is talking to him. It tells him that he can never escape, and that he exists within all men.

Fast page turner and you just can't wait to see what happens next.<br /><br />Now, as far as the story and the underlining meaning go. Meat or rescue!! Meat or rescue? Instant gratification or plan to succeed in a long run?<br /><br />The story is about a bunch of British boys of various ages, who end up, due to the plane crash on the deserted island. Though they are young, aging from 6 to 12, they are right away thrown into decisions on rules, order and plan of what needs to be done to survive and eventually being rescued. Not to ruin it further, I will not say more than this as far as the plot, but I do want to point out a few things that just a great example of society structure in any given situation.<br /><br />Right away the boys decide to set up leadership and rules. Though, at first, they follow that structure, democratic counsel of their assembly, the leadership and ranking, they eventually do not subject themselves to the outline of their rules. Even though there are those who do want to keep everything in line, as per agreed, there are others who choose to rule by a mob mentality and modify their societal structure as they see fit, hence instant gratification and chaos, even tyranny. It is a perfect example that if we, as a society are driven by democracy, without any specific set of rules that we all follow, eventually we end up with disastrous outcomes, even if it seems to be pleasing in the short term. The structure, where everyone has input, but sticks to the same set of rules, is the only structure that makes people live by certain standards, not power struggle and emotions. Not promises of instant pleasures, but goals to eventually succeed for everyone's benefit. I am not talking about everyone's benefit in the \\"equal and fair\\" scenario where everyone pretends that we can all do our equal and fair share, but the actual set of standards, rules and assigned tasks to complete a specific task. We see many examples where, if we all get the same, if we all work together, fail and fail every single time. When everyone rips the same benefit, but doesn't have to work the same, then eventually you end up with no one doing and everyone wanting. Also, we see, that if someone has something to dangle in front of the others and the rules are not kept, then you have tyranny based on promises of quick and instant gratification, hence \\"I give you meat\\". What about the rescue? Well, I give you meat now!!<br /><br />I love this book. It is a perfect example of a society in a very simple terms. How society as such, can exist, but only due to conditions that are set and mentioned above, otherwise we are all savages who are run by another savage, who throws us a piece of meat now and then.<br /><br />I would also like to recommend:<br />[[ASIN:0451526341 Animal Farm]]<br />[[ASIN:1462687628 Aftertastes and Tales from Russia]]specific task.

US	18869462	R1POH40OH7QQZA	1573226122	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	3	1	4	N	N	Another Meh Classic	A group of boys ends up ?shipwrecked? plane-crashed? on an empty tropical island. There are basically two groups: older boys of about 11-12, and young ones of about six. No adults. One older boy (Ralph) wants to establish rules and responsibilities; another (Piggy) is weak (fat, asthmatic, spectacled) but smart, while Jack wants to paint his face, have fun and kill things.<br /><br />Does this still hold up as classic? I suppose; certainly it's become an oft-referenced cultural meme. But there are HUGE hole in this story - how did they get to this island, WHY are they on the island, and if they were plane- or shipwrecked, why isn't anyone seriously injured on landing on the island? How is it that they are so widely separated on the island and have no idea how many of them there should be, or where they are?<br /><br />Why doesn't anyone GET injured (fall and break an arm, for instance) or get sick and die from an infected cut or gash? There's an almost total lack of the older boys looking after each other or the younger ones; would that truly be the case? Not that pre-teens can't be self-centered, cruel and brutal; of course they can, but they can also be surprisingly sensitive and kind.<br /><br />The main characters are one-dimensional stereotypes; the littluns are props. I got the impression that this author doesn't know young boys very well, and dislikes what he does know of them, as well as having a very dim view of humanity in general. Is this truly a book that reveals the dark and flawed side of human nature? Or just a dark and flawed book that people found shocking for its time?	2013-10-28

It is a story of schoolboys, ranging from teenagers to much younger, that crash land onto an island.  The island is large, with many fruit bearing plants and trees, plenty of fire wood, and a many wild pigs.  The boys all come together and elect a leader, Ralph, and they decide to keep a fire lit, build huts, urinate and defecate in designated areas, and decide things by a group vote.  Ralph is representative of sanity.  Piggy is a fat boy with glasses that helps Ralph make decisions and is his right hand man.  Piggy is representative of logic and intelligence.  Jack, is a boy who disapproves of Ralph and wants to be the leader of the boys.  He likes to hunt, kill the pigs, and the power of leading.  Jack is representative of the evil and wild in humans.  After many weeks on the island, Jack is able to gain his power and all but a few boys join his side and embrace their wild nature.  The boys' focuses are to kill pigs and to do what Jack tells them to do.  This leads to the death of many boys and the destruction of much of the island.  At the end of the story, Jack leads a island-wide hunt for Ralph.<br /><br />I would highly recommend reading this book, which is why I did not reveal how the story ends.

The motivations of some of the characters are beyond me. There doesn't seem to be a 'nice' boy among the whole lot of them. Maybe Piggy, but he seems to spend the whole time following the boys who are cruel to him, which makes it hard to feel too much sympathy or affection for him. I did not understand Ralph's behaviour at the beginning at all. I think I have trouble putting myself in other's shoes, if I was in Ralph's place (as an adult female) I know what I would do, but I don't know what I would do if I was a 12-year-old boy. Definitely a compelling, if sometimes mystifying, read. To be continued...<br /><br />WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />6/4 - I'm having some problems with the disjointedness of the dialogue. The boys start and stop sentences all over the place, making the flow of some of the conversations a bit hard to follow. Some of the words used as an alternative to \\"Wow!\\" are completely unfamiliar, which is to be expected considering the time it was written as well as the era it was set, but it does add to the confusion created by the broken sentences. I'm glad to see Jack go, but at the same time I think his departure from the main group is just going to cause a slow burn of resentment that will lead to an even worse explosion the longer it's allowed to simmer. To be continued...<br /><br />WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />7/4 - See, an even bigger explosion and now poor Piggy's dead, as well as Simon. The boys had faults that caused me to feel a lack of sympathy towards all of them, to some degree (some more than others), so the only time I felt even a little bit emotional was during the description of the killing of the first sow. While I was telling myself not to tear up I was also thinking \\"Those stupid boys, don't they realise if they kill the sows the piglets won't have a mother to feed them and they'll die of starvation, cutting off your meat supply completely. They should be killing a piglet every few days instead.\\"<br />Another reviewer mentioned that this book is taught in primary school (although they actually said grade school), I desperately hope it's not taught to children of such a young age (the 10-year-old boys that I remember from my school days would've attempted to act out some of the more gruesome scenes in the playground at lunchtime, with possibly horrific results). This is definitely an 'M' rated book, with graphic descriptions of pig slaughtering, dead bodies that appear to move, murder and what happens to a person's body when they fall off a cliff - subject matter far too adult for anyone under the age of 14.<br />Most of the boys' ages aren't given, except to divide them into groups of either 'littluns' or 'biguns'. The 'littluns' being around 6 and, I think, the 'biguns' being anywhere from 10 to 14, but it was hard to tell just from the writing. When the rescue arrived and Jack was described as being a 'little boy' I thought maybe I had been wrong in imagining him as a big 14-year-old, maybe he just seemed big because of his aggressive and domineering personality. I wonder what would've happened if there had been another chapter. Would there have been some kind of disciplinary action when the boys got back to England and possibly had to explain what had happened on that island?should be killing a piglet every few days instead.\\"<br />Another reviewer mentioned that this book is taught in primary school (although they actually said grade school), I desperately hope it's not taught to children of such a young age (the 10-year-old boys that I remember from my school days would've attempted to act out some of the more gruesome scenes in the playground at lunchtime, with possibly horrific results).

But as petty rivalries develop, can they stay focused on their goal of returning to civilization, or will they get caught up in the pull of fun and savagery?  It was a good macro-plot, but I felt it was a bit slow at times without many plot developments or surprises.<br /><br />2) Characters (3 stars) - Ralph is the good leader fighting for civilization, Piggy is his physically-challenged but intellectually-strong confidant, and Jack is their antagonist growing powerful on the allure of savagery.  All three represented interesting opposing forces, but I didn't feel any were drawn with the details of inner conflicts or desires.<br /><br />3) Theme (3 stars) - I suppose the message is how close civilized man is to his superstitious, blood thirsty roots; and how given the opportunity, we gladly fall into this state.  I certainly agree that man is capable of awful things, but I also think he is capable of kindness, compassion, and beauty, and that other side wasn't explored at all in this book.  That said, it was a book about kids, and without social conditioning kids can be very cruel creatures, so perhaps this devolution would happen as quick and totally as it does in this story.  Moreover, the island struggles were juxtaposed against the backdrop of a larger adult war off island, so perhaps it's supposed to show how our modern civilized wars aren't that different than anarchic childhood squabbles.<br /><br />4) Voice (3 stars) - The prose was readable, but I didn't mark any sentence as especially poetic, insightful, or clever.<br /><br />5) Setting (3 stars) - Although Golding spends a lot of time describing the details of his island, for some reason I didn't really feel transported there until the final scenes.<br /><br />6) Overall (3 stars) - I remember really liking this book in high school, but upon rereading it, it seemed too simple--in plot, in characters, in theme--for me to recommend it now.  It could have been much more.ading it, it seemed too simple--in plot, in characters, in theme--for me to recommend it now.  It could have been much more.	2013-09-12

I usually don't pay more than 0.00 to 3.99, on Kindle, but I had to buy \\"Lord of the Flies\\" for $8.99.<br /><br />I'd read this novel as a kid, and it stayed with me. I can see all the scenes like a movie, even though I read it 40 years ago.<br /><br />That's a classic. That is the real definition of a classic novel.<br /><br />And it truly frightening. William Goldman goes not only into the heart of young boys, but also into the heart of all people who might find themselves lost and trying to find a place, which might include killing those who aren't included in that place.<br /><br />It's a very horrific, and well written, novel.

At the outset of World War III, a plane full of prep-school boys crashes within swimming distance of a small tropical island in what could be considered the Pacific.<br /><br />Immediately we are introduced to two characters. Quickly enough, more are added. Some have names, others do not. Strangely enough, none of the boys know each other. Golding creates a fictional scenario without adults. The children have no one to look up to. Meanwhile in the rest of the world, the very people children are supposed to mimic are off destroying each other in yet another global conflict. We, the reader, keep leaning on the children's innocence to stay intact until help arrives.<br /><br />When it becomes apparent that rescue is adventitious and survival must come from within, the Freud's psychoanalytic personality theory begins to take center stage: The id, the ego, and the superego. According to Freud, all humans are born in the id stage of personality: it is the drive for sex, destruction and death. It is the proverbial devil on the shoulder. It is the impulsive manner in which humans are born. Counter the id with the superego which is responsible for extensive thought-out consideration. It is bulbous in time, almost to a fault. It is the angel on the opposite shoulder. In the middle is the ego (the current state in which we all exist), the decision center which listens to both sides and makes the final decision. In times of emergency, the id may be louder. In times of expectancy, the superego may be the most powerful, but the ego is the decision-maker almost all the time in hopes of preserving the person. Three characters blatantly represent Freud's theory throughout the story.<br /><br />And yet, when adult situations occur, one must reflect on the plot and remind ourselves that this is an island full of children (children!) who are plunging deep - and quickly - into depravity. At the same time, adults send unintentional messages reminding the children of the barbaric war taking place within the \\"societal structure\\" of the world. These children had no chance, and if they survive, these children will be tainted for life. What isn't understood by the children are labeled as beasties and terrific fear. And every time the children commit unspeakable sin, Golding paints a picture of nature almost sighing in sadness and disbelief that it has to clean up after them (and again).<br /><br />To read this on a level that believes it is just a book about boys on an island would be the beginning. Read it again for the Freud aspect. Read it again for the religious aspect. Read it again for the barbarity aspect. Read it again for the nature aspect. This book will continue to offer something each time. What is relieving is no movie has encapsulated Golding's message. Perhaps this book is too well-rounded to be captured for the big screen. Golding references English books that were published to guide British boys in the correct direction of society. That message flutters in the wind at the end of the book when the theme gives way, the center cannot hold, and the reader realizes that all hope has been abandoned for the children on this island, and perhaps, sadly enough, the world.<br /><br />This book is a classic. Golding's skill is evident with the fact that he gets his message across in just over 200 pages. It can be applied to today's society as it could back in the fifties and sixties when this book was released and initially squandered. Read this classic and allow it to alter your view of how people interact, because it is just that good.into depravity.

While this was required reading when I was in high school decades ago, we actually read this aloud as a family with my children who are 10 and 8 and it led to some deep and meaningful conversations about the human condition.

Normally when my class reads a novel out loud, I tend to dose of and start thinking about other things and just try to catch key words in the book. But, Golding's book kept me on my toes and showed me how deep the simplest thing can go into symbolism. Like for example, glasses, Piggy's glasses we a key figure in the book and represented fire. This book also made me concentrate on all the little details that went into making such a vivid book. I hope that I can learn from Golding, so the next time I write a paper for my school I plan to put in a lot of symbolization and detail.	2013-05-09

For some reason I was under the assumption that it was about a war and it had an Animal Farm thing going, and I took Lord of the flies a little too literally. I thought he was actually creating an army of flies... In some ways, I wish that was what the story had been about. Maybe it would've been more interesting.<br /><br /> Spoilers!<br /><br />This story deals with young school aged boys. They get trapped on an island and figure out how to survive. I wish I could say that was where the story picked up but it never did. I found the book to be depressing at times but other than that uninteresting.<br /><br />What surprises me, is on the back cover is a quote from Stephen King. He says, \\"Lord of the Flies (is my selection for the book that changed my life) because it is both a story with a message and because it is a great tale of adventure. My advice about reading is to do a lot of it.\\" With the exception of the last part of his quote I just don't get it. Great tale of adventure? Little kids running around an island trying to kill anything that moves definitely is not my idea of an adventure.<br /><br />I do think that this book serves its purpose in my class though. It is the perfect story to dissect and look at from many different perspectives and through the eyes of many different literary theorists, but as a novel to read just for fun, it was lacking the fun.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I'm sorry to say it but I disliked this novel. I don't understand why there is hype about it and why it is taught so often in English classes, unless for the sole purpose of looking at it critically. The story didn't entertain me, it was actually something that if I saw it happen in real life I would prefer to look away from it. It was the opposite of a train wreck you can't stop staring it. It was like being the babysitter to the infamous toddler Chucky.<br /><br />I don't mean to offend anyone by this review and if you had a different experience while reading this book please leave a comment below.

Maybe It's Only Us.<br /><br /> \\"Maybe there is a beast... maybe it's only us.\\" Simon, the frail and nearly prophetic boy whom any reader will come to love, is the owner of these words. In one shyly spoken statement, he sums up the nature of this novel. Left without rules and restraint, the true essence of a man's heart is revealed.<br /><br /> In an unknown year during a fictional war, a plane wreck strands a group of young boys on an island. No adults survive, leaving this young group to fend for themselves. They arrive onto the island as good-natured and innocent, but progressively transform into violent savages.<br /><br /> This brings us to the strongest theme in Lord of the Flies, primitivity. How can a congregation of well-brought up British boys dissolve into a pack of primitives due simply to a lack of supervision? What does this reveal about man? In addition to the dissolution of sanity, there is a loss of innocence that occurs in these boys. They become mindless and bloodthirsty, unable to distinguish man from beast.<br /><br /> Our main character is Ralph, the attractive and \\"fair-haired\\" boy. However, he is not just a pretty face. In the first chapter, he comes into possession of a conch shell and uses it to gather the scattered children across the island. At this first assembly, it is decided that a chief must be established. Naturally, the boys vote in the owner of the conch. Later in the story, when all seems to be lost and the majority of survivors have gone mad, Ralph continues to fight for order, peace, and the chance of rescue.<br /><br /> The second person to be introduced is a fat and socially awkward boy whose true name we will never know. He is eternally branded as Piggy. Though he becomes the social outcast of the group, he also becomes the very image of law and order. Jack, Ralph's greatest enemy, despises Piggy and isn't afraid to show it. Jack is in charge of a small clan of hunters and attempts to gain power over the island and overthrow the system first established by Ralph.<br /><br /> And then there's Simon. Timid yet compassionate, this wise choir boy is going to become your favorite character. At our first meeting, he faints, showing the physical weakness that becomes the hallmark of his character. Yet, despite his hallucinations and bloody noses, he is the only person to discover the truth about \\"the beast\\".<br /><br /> When reading Lord of the Flies, you are going to read the phrase \\"the beast\\" constantly. That's because the beast represents the fear these boys develop and the violent nature that comes alongside desperation. Simon, however, is the only boy to have this revelation. All the others believe that the beast is a living and breathing terror who wants nothing else but to destroy them. He alone understands that the greatest threat is themselves. Thus comes his great line, \\"Maybe there is a beast... maybe it's only us.\\"<br /><br />  While the main objective is to convict the nature of society, one can not read William Golding's Lord of the Flies without also examining one's own heart and thoughts. What is the nature of man's heart? If savagery is born out of a lack of rules and restraint, is mankind nothing more than primitives dressed in clothing? These young boys thought they were being threatened and killed by the beast, but truly it was only themselves.the system first established by Ralph.<br /><br /> And then there's Simon.

US	49281553	R12LIWLRST1DYM	B004210ERC	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Julie L	Lord of the flies has a very interesting feel to it when you're reading it. The book is about our human nature, and there is a lot of symbolism scattered throughout this book. People often think that the book was \\"too gross\\" to read because of it's graphic writing, but William Golding was trying to paint us a picture about our human nature. The ugly truth. In chapter five it says \\"Maybe there is a beast....maybe it's only us.\\"<br /><br />The story begins just after a plane crash. We meet English schoolboys who have survived the crash and find themselves on a deserted island without any adults. There are three interesting characters in this book: Jack, Piggy, and Ralph. Jack is living on this island and is trying to survive, but he likes to have fun and unable to control his urges. Piggy is also another interesting character, he is always trying to find the easy way out or trying to come up with an excuse not to do something. Ralph is, I guess you could say, \\"in the middle\\" of Jack and Piggy. He's just trying to figure out his way but he can't seem to find one. Ralph is the one who is above everyone else, in control. At one point in the book, Jack splits off with the main group and goes off on his own. Jack recruits more boys with him and suddenly conflict comes about with Piggy and Ralph versus Jack and his \\"new tribe\\", which has a lot of symbolism. I enjoyed reading this book although there were times when I had to put the book down because of the graphic details, and the beginning was tough to get through, but once you get to the story it's fun to read. I give this book three out of five stars.	2012-12-14

So much is symbolized within the novel that it is truly mindboggling (I did spell that wrong, dont judge). Now I do believe that this novel is not for persons under 15 (thats my age). On the surface this is an interesting novel that tells of several boys decent into madness and savagery. This is all a younger child will see. They will also see pointless violence and deaths. However, in this novel, everything is done for a purpose (how it hates me to say those words dont ask why). Each character symbolizes something or someone, each place, each scene has its own importance that truly adds too the novel. Another complaint is that the novel is boring. I do not really understand how it is boring. It is thoroughly intriguing and entertaining. Another complaint is that the novel is altogether too gory. I personally believe this is an overstatement, however i do read fantasy and sci-fi commonly so I do have some experience with gore and am not particularly bothered by it. For some reason i feel like those reviewers typically enjoy romances. The final overall complaint is that the novel is too dark. This i cannot really fault this argument, for the novel does border on mild horror at some points (psycologically). Yet it all is important in desplaying the darker side of human nature. Overall this is a great novel, that deserves acclaim even if read in English class. i recommend reading it alone before you read it with your teacher. Yet this is my opinion.	2012-08-05

It was surprisingly short and fast;it didn't quite live up to the hype in my mind but it was still well worth a read.  It certainly can be interpreted as an allegory for the base nature of man and especially of the power of 'the mob.'  Overall I thought Golding's descriptions and the way he kept the narrative moving was very effective; the characters evolved from typical schoolboys into something fierce, raw and unscrupulous.  However I felt that I needed more character development and background in order to really care about these characters and therefore feel fully horrified at what happens to them.	2012-07-13

I believe I enjoyed it (which is somewhat of a surprise since I hated reading then) and found it exciting. I re-read it recently, ~20 years later, thinking I'd have a new found appreciation for it or at least better insight into the story. However, the second time around was painful. The story was slow and boring and I just couldn't find anything interesting or redeeming about it. I struggled to even finish and after finishing it I don't understand why I bothered.<br /><br />I've read some of the positive reviews and spoken with people who were both fond and not fond of the book and I certainly did not catch the greater meaning of some events in the book that those who enjoyed it did. While reading I never got a sense of some great symbolism or insight. It just felt like a bunch of kids trying to appear important, running around an island to me.<br /><br />I would consider reading it again because of the extensive positive feedback the book has received through the decades, but I fear I'll come to the same conclusion then hate myself for finishing it in misery a second time. Perhaps, I'll wait until I'm marooned on an island with a bunch of kids and read it as a defense manual.	2012-03-13

Drawing on my own experiences, the story is wonderfully believable. A group of boys ranging in age from about six to fourteen are stranded on an island in the pacific and form their own version of goverment. Beginning with a crude form of democracy, they eventually devolve into a tribal group where primitive instincts and fears establish their social imperitives. I recall reading the book when I was in school, but couldn't fully grasp the meaning then. Having aged much since then, and raised two boys of my own, 'The Lord of the Flies' has taken on a whole new significance.	2012-02-22

What I really like about Lord of the Flies is the psychological aspect of the interaction between the boys and later on the planned and reasoned speeches and conversations of the lead character, Ralph.

It's a book that requires your full attention and it not something you can just skim over and be done within a day. Everything and everyone in this story is a symbol of a more complex idea. Roger isn't just \\"bad\\" or \\"mean\\", he's sadistic and a representation of evil in its purest form. Take Jack for example: He's a person who uses power for the benefit of himself not the whole community, in other words, a dictator. But on a more serious note, he represents how in the wild, characteristics a person has, are more pure; The rules of society that had tamed and controlled these malicious attributes (Or in Simon's case: Good-natured) are now absent, and that pronounces and extremes these qualities. That is why I like the Lord of the Flies. It makes you mull over every event and pondering on what William Golding is trying to show or tell us. It really is an extraordinary book that captures the essence of after the abandonment of civilization, how sometimes humans' greatest enemy is themselves.	2012-01-11

US	35284182	R3CDU8GN6YYZN9	0571200532	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Book Review	In William Golding's novel The Lord of the Flies, a group of twelve year old boys are stranded on an island in the midst of a war.  Golding has chosen the perfect setting and age group to illustrate his point.  By using twelve year old boys instead of grown men, he is able to better explore the human tendency towards cruelty (as these twelve year olds do not have civilization fully ingrained into their natural instincts).  The allegorical nature of the novel worked in Golding's favor; the reader clearly understands that Golding believes that humans are not born pure and moral -these traits are learned over a long period of time.<br /> Because Golding meant the novel to be allegorical, it is not very realistic.  The characters Ralph, Piggy, and Jack seem to be rather flat, as we know next to nothing about them.  Also, these children barely mention missing their families or their old lives.  In fact, most of them readily abandon it without a second thought to explore their inner savage.  The island the boys are stranded on also happens to have plenty of fruit; the boys' overwhelming desire for meat, especially at such a young age, seems out of place.  The reader must employ some pretty serious suspension of belief while reading this novel.  Ultimately however, these traits helped contribute to the novel's strong and incredibly complex symbolism which leaves the reader to ponder over the true nature of human behavior.	2011-12-13

It all begins quite nicely with order and with Ralph as the elected chief. Rules are created and jobs are divided amongst the boys. But things tip into chaos very quickly when a second anarchical faction rises up among the boys. They quickly descend into savagery and Ralph and his friend Piggy are the lone representatives of reason and law. Human nature shows its most sinister side and all hell breaks loose. There is a mysterious 'beastie' inhabiting the island which provokes fear in all the boys, big and small. But the beastie is really themselves and how they behave towards each other when they throw law and order to the wind. It is the ugliness inside all of their hearts which they have allowed to run free. This book was definitely an eye opener for the dark side of human nature and makes you think if this is what would happen if the world suddenly turned into a similarly lawless place.	2011-11-29

The descent to tribalism and savagery is not reassuring, but Golding may well have been right for all that.  He gave them a relatively hospitable environment; not populated with dangerous wild beasts, capable of feeding them and providing fuel, and with a warm sea for swimming. They established a forum, elected a leader, appointed certain boys to particular roles, and set about maintaining a column of rising smoke to draw the attention of any passing ships.  The smoke, and the fire generating it, become a major theme of the book. The fire gets out of control and a boy disappears, presumed burned. Serious tension arises when the group assigned to maintaining the fire chooses instead to hunt wild pigs; a ship is briefly seen on the horizon, but at that critical time there is no smoke from the island to attract it.  The fire is moved to a more accessible place on the island, but at cost to visibility.  Then the hunters, who quickly become a majority of the boys, set themselves up as a separate community on a different part of the island. They lack fire, so set about stealing it.  Had they asked, it would have been given to them.  Then it occurs to them to take by force the means to make fire.<br /><br />As I read the book I was moved to recall social relationships and conflicts in the classrooms and playgrounds of my own experience, and to reflect on the value to growing children of the oft-resented adult ordering of the world.  One could read and enjoy the book at that level and leave it there. But, if we are minded to follow, Golding offers to take us further.  It seems the world beyond the island is engaged in nuclear conflict.  Can the adults be imagined to have got things right?  How did they get themselves into that mutually destructive situation?  Has the adult world not also descended into tribalism and savagery?	2011-11-28

I'm not one who enjoys books of this sort and when I began reading the first chapters, I strongly disliked it. The first chapters are slow and hard to follow along and the symbolism can be tiring. However, once you get further into the book, small things happen that leave a reader wondering and you can't help but continue to read on and on. One cannot help but make connections over and over again when reading LotF.<br />  LotF really works your mind. Nearly everything in the book is a symbol of something else. This given fact leaves you wondering what everything could represent, from Piggy's glasses to the beast. You'll find yourself cheering on either Ralph or Jack and you will feel like you are fighting to survive with everyone else. The details paint such a vivid image in the reader's mind that you'll feel as if you were there. A reader will be lost in the movie in their head.<br />  I do reccomend reading Lord of the Flies & I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.	2011-11-01

I think that it affects men and young boys differently,stronger than women and young girls. I think it's one of the best books ever written.	2011-07-01
US	16765981	RFQ4CDBFDJG0I	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	3	5	5	N	N	Unrealistic	Although the story of the book was decent, and the symbolism very complex, I did not really agree with the message of the book, and found its theme unrealistic. I don't think that the situation would collapse into anarchy but instead primitive government, such as in the beginning of the book.<br /><br />The desires of the boys to \\"just have fun\\" were very unrealistic and counter-intuitive. For example, not one person outside of Ralph and Piggy truly care about getting off the island. No one misses their family, and it is not even mentioned. There is no discussion of the boys' background except for the fact that they are English, and nobody ever thinks about it. It is completely unrealistic to ignore the fact that in the real world, the first priority of the boys would be to try and escape and go back to the civilized world.<br /><br />Secondly, the overwhelming desire for meat, which is supposed to symbolize the savagery in humans, is highly exaggerated. The fruit on the island is plentiful and there are many resources. The boys never have any problem getting food and realistically would not engage in such frivolous hunting for meat.<br /><br />I also found the characterization extremely flat. The characters are just faceless names on the page outside of Raplh, Piggy, Jack, and Simon.	2011-06-21

It completely demonstrated a unique and interesting plot. School boys are forced to live by themselves because a plane crashed on an island. There are so many ideas that could be thought of with this one situation. The author created this situation and developed it into a made up society of kids who try to work together but end up turning against one another. It is a totally realistic way of describing this rare, fictitious occasion. I liked how there was an unexpected twist of Simons death after he realizes that there is no beast and that the beast is a fear within everyone. Ralph showed many leadership qualities as he instructed everyone to do the right thing and maintain their signal for help. Jack is entirely against him and wants to hunt to stay alive instead of follow Ralph's commands. This creates the dysfunction among the boys which is the worst thing that could happen. I could tell at the beginning that Piggy a target since he was previously picked on and was portrayed as fat. He is later killed by the other tribe. I thought the end was somewhat predictable. I had a sense that they would be saved sooner or later. The officer ends up coming to their rescue.	2010-12-02

Unlike most such literary explorations, we learn here that free will may not be all that great after all, or a confining social order all that bad.<br /><br />A plane crashes in a tropical island, leaving a large but unorganized group of pre-teen boys the only survivors. A boy named Ralph takes charge by virtue of a vote, and for a while the boys work reasonably as a team to facilitate their rescue. But dark forces are at work from within and without, and soon the social order the boys came in with is displaced by brutality and murder.<br /><br />A familiar subject of parody on such shows as \\"South Park\\" and \\"The Simpsons\\", \\"Lord Of The Flies\\" was itself written as something of a parody of the English children's novel \\"The Coral Island\\". In \\"The Coral Island\\", a boy named Ralph and his two friends find themselves on a desert island and display sufficiency and daring before their eventual rescue. Here there is no such sufficiency, and only a negative kind of daring. Neither boy nor nature is of a kind to play by the rules, perhaps author William Golding's point when he presented this in 1954 after having served in the Royal Navy during World War II.<br /><br />Ralph may be our hero, but Golding points out he's not much of a leader. Ralph, he writes, \\"would treat the day's decisions as though he were playing chess. The only trouble was that he would never be a very good chess player.\\"<br /><br />Ralph's brain trust, a kid with the unfortunate nickname \\"Piggy\\", is arguably no help, full of whiny hall-monitor admonishments and rather lazy besides. Also an ally is the insightful but rather moony Simon, a bit of a lone wolf. About the only boy who really seems up to the task of taking charge here is a choir leader named Jack, a natural-born hunter who rallies the others with talk of painting their faces and having fun.<br /><br />Of course, Jack's the bad guy, but after a few readings I can almost imagine this story being told by Jack in an alternate version as a sort of parable of free-living youngsters shaking off the adult wanna-bes in their midst to get in tune with their wild sides. Never mind the fact that some of them, like the sadistic Roger, are more in need of a sedative.<br /><br />Though the book is dark, it is neither oppressive nor boring. High schoolers should take heart - there are much duller books you can be reading than this. If you are like me, you may even find the novel electrifying in the way it keys in upon the hardness of growing up. The beasties Ralph and the others live in fear of may be fantasy, but bullies are real, and few books depict that sad rite of passage as well as this one.<br /><br />Great writing, too. Each chapter has a fully realized sense all its own, and Golding's depiction of the island and its natural, chaotic beauty make for some memorable passages: \\"The assembly looked with him, considered the vast stretches of water, the high sea beyond, unknown indigo of infinite possibility, heard silently the sough and whisper from the reef.\\" The natural world does at times seem to be a menacing force as described by Golding.<br /><br />\\"Lord Of The Flies\\" was a favorite of mine in high school, and remains so nearly 30 years later.

It was about surviving on an island and finding more people. So I'm going to write a review. Here is what the book is about.<br /><br />Two boys, Ralph and Piggy were alone on an island, so they thought. When they went to the beach, they found a conch. Since Piggy didn't want to blow it Ralph blew and more kids came. Since there were more kids, some people wanted the leader to be a kid named Jack and some people wanted Ralph to be leader. They took a vote and Ralph was leader.<br /><br />One day, they went to a rock and climbed it. Ralph and Jack and a kid named Roger came with them. Then, they went down. They then decide to split in to two groups but they would still stay in touch. They then walked back to their base.<br /><br />Another day, Jack's group stole Piggy's glasses and he got mad and told them to give them back. They said no. Then, they invaded (invaded what?). Later, a guy on a boat came to bring them back home. He asked if any were dead. Ralph said two. They took them and they never went back to the island.<br /><br />They got rescued. Most stories like this; at the end they get rescued. I always predict that and I'm always right. This book should be read by kids. It's a great book. The font is a little small but I still liked it.	2010-07-29

It is also a great study on human nature. It is the perfect example on why anarchy can not work. Human nature does not allow a society without hierachy to function. It all falls apart in the end. Also when one reads the book, one can also get a lot of pop culture references to the book like the conch, and piggy. The Simpsons has a funny rendition of the novel as well.

A planeload of British schoolboys crashes on a desert island in the Pacific during the early part of World War II.  No adults survive the crash and the boys settle in to \\"have some fun\\" and await rescue once their parents realize what's happened.  Ralph, one of the older boys at around 13, is voted the leader of the group (which includes young children as well - \\"littluns\\" and \\"biguns\\").  Ralph is aided by a nearsighted and overweight boy callously nicknamed Piggy, who suggests he blow a conch shell to gather everyone together.  Initially they all agree on some rules, and most help out, but there soon becomes a division in the group as another boy, Jack Merridew, challenges Ralph's rules.<br /><br />I was never assigned to read this in school and didn't really have much interest in it.  All I'd heard was that it was a dark and disturbing tale, and something about the boys eating each other (they don't, though).  But when my son was assigned it in school I thought I might read it, too, since he usually likes to discuss such things with me.  And I'm glad I did - it was a fascinating story.  (My son also loved it).<br /><br />My two favorite books are [[ASIN:141656151X Robinson Crusoe]] and Jules Verne's [[ASIN:0812972120 The Mysterious Island]] - both stories of castaways - and the thought of being on an island and the way they overcome the challenges always fascinated me.  In both those stories the castaways build up a society of sorts (even though it's only one person in Crusoe's case) that prospers and flourishes.  Lord of the Flies is quite the opposite, where the group degenerates into tribes with disastrous results.<br /><br />But the characters add depth to the story, as well.  Ralph, the natural leader, is so happy at the beginning that he stands on his head and sees it as a chance for fun, but recognizes the importance of building shelters and maintaining a signal fire.  Piggy is the most intelligent boy, but is picked on by the others for his weight, glasses, and asthma.  But he's the voice of reason and supports Ralph's leadership, and his glasses become essential for starting fires.  Jack, on the other hand, while also a natural leader, soon grows to resent Ralph's authority and seeks a more blood-thirsty role for his group (of choirboys, ironically) as hunters.  It's Jack's acceptance of violence that undermines the democratic order.  But it's this idea of law and order that forms the basis for the book - without laws and rules society falls apart.  When members fail to fill their role (such as keeping the fire going, or helping to build the shelters, etc.) it affects everyone - especially the most vulnerable (littluns).  And without that order maintained by the rules, chaos results.<br /><br />I listened to the audio book read by the author, William Golding, and he offers a few interesting observations at the beginning and the end.  I found it to be a very well-written book and full of meaning on multiple levels.  It might be a bit dark and disturbing, but it was also compelling and I couldn't stop till I was done.  I highly recommend it for those who appreciate a book with some depth.s the voice of reason and supports Ralph's leadership, and his glasses become essential for starting fires.

Psychological components thats play major roles in the story are: power-lust, shame and pride, social status and authority, mob-logic, goals and values, the conflict between immediate pleasure and long-term salvation, sense of morality, and various forms of fear.<br /><br />It's brilliant how Golding uses all these components of our nature to tell a convincing and enthralling story about how peace can degenerate into outright war.<br /><br />I must admit I felt the story was a little boring at the start.

William Golding's Lord of the Flies is the story of a group of school boys that crash land on an island and are stranded with no adult supervision. This story that begins so innocently soon takes a turn for the worst. At first glance this novel is a story of children gone bad but with careful thought it becomes a concept much bigger than the children themselves.<br /> Many say this is about the psychology of children when no one is around to supervise them but I feel this explains, through a story about children gone wrong, the necessity for a central government. I think the story, that seems very crude, is actually our society and history in a nutshell. A group of people do like there government, so they break away. This in my opinion is a fairly simple concept but put into a story people think of it as some horrific thing. However, it is a fairly natural reaction. Whether or not this is how William Golding intended it to be understood, I think this is not supposed to be a story of children that go stir crazy on an island but a depiction of society.<br /> I definitely think this should be taught in schools. Firstly, it is an idea that most children have thought about, and it is an interesting story that captures the minds of the readers. Secondly, it gives you a different perspective of our society as a whole; something that seemed so normal but put into a story is actually a scary thought. This is a very valuable lesson to be taught and I believe all people should be exposed to different perspectives.	2009-12-11

They have many different views on how to best live on the island. Jack thought hunting would be the best way to survive on the island. Ralph's idea was to start a fire on the top of the island so that they might get the attention of any passing boat and be rescued.  Ralph also wanted to keep things as civilized as possible while Jack preferred to start a tribe and live like the Indians would. After Jack captured some of Ralph's most loyal companions, Sam and Eric, Ralph goes to save them. When he gets there, the twins, Sam and Eric, are covering the side of Jack's island that Ralph approaches. Sam and Eric tell Ralph that everyone in Jack's tribe is going to hunt him, so Ralph runs after being chased across the island. He sees a Naval Officer on shore that rescues all the kids. The Naval Officer saw the fire and Ralph's civilized ways saves them all.<br /><br />Ralph's character is strong-hearted, smart and always trying to help others. Another character like Ralph is Zech from the book series A Land Remembered. Ralph is strong-hearted and always tries to stick through hard times just like Zech. Both are smart and both try their best to help others. Ralph will lead the kids of the island and help them off the island. Zech would rather ask for something for his horse Ishmael than for himself. The two characters would probably get along well if they could learn to respect each others opinion. If both were put on the island, they would help each other because the island converted to Jack's tribe since no meat was being collected. Zech would know how to capture pigs since he has herded cows with his dad and company.<br /><br />The Lord of the Flies is a book that shows how people push themselves to do what is best. Ralph tries to show the ways of civilization and how to get saved. Jack tries to find ways to get meat and take over the island. This book is great for testing your mind and for considering which decisions you would make. To figure out how the decisions the boys made played through, people should read the book and find out.<br /><br />Overall, one through five, with a five being the best, I would give this book a four.

This is Sir William Golding's most ingenious insight into human-nature and group political psychology.<br /><br />The pessimistic truth: when faced with the prospect of striving and attaining a higher-potential ..or merely settling for an easily acquired base commonality (for whatever dubious reasons), ...what path will MOST people take?<br /><br />Suddenly marooned on a small tropical island, a group of British school-boys find themselves confronted by a survival situation. Their plight soon renders them a microcosm of any tribe, community, or nation in flux.<br /><br />No adults survived the shipwreck. The two most intelligent and responsible boys, Ralph and \\"Piggy\\"(real name not revealed), logically assess the situation. They realize that through discipline, hard work, cooperation, and organization, the boys can survive on this small island until they are rescued. There is just enough food to eat, if they are careful. By adhering to a regular program of foraging, maintaining shelters, and manning a sentry-post to watch for the rescuers, they organize their people in an impressive effort. They establish a rudimentary system of democracy, with regular mandatory meetings for all, to address the immediate and potential concerns of the group.<br /><br />Unfortunately, amongst the survivors, is one Jack Merridew, the leader of a choir group. Jack, who is probably not as intelligent as Piggy or Ralph, has the advantage of being a natural charismatic-leader, and therefore, a natural \\"politicain\\".

If so, this is the book for you. Lord of the Flies is not only an adventure but it is also a struggle of life and death at your fingertips. Each page weaves a magnificent story about a group of English school boys and their many struggles as they try to stay alive.<br /><br />The reason I love this book is the beautiful choice of words the author, William Golding, put into the book. The words paint a picture that makes you feel sad when the characters are sad or happy when the characters are happy. Golding's Lord of the Flies is truly a work of art.<br /><br />  At the dawn of World War II, a small plane carrying a group of English school boys, all from the age of 6-12, crashes on an island somewhere in the South Pacific. The island is abundant with water, fruit, and wild pigs for meat. With all of these resources, they start to form a microcosm on the island.<br /><br />The character that stands out in the book is Piggy.  In the book, Piggy represents common sense. He is a rather large boy, but his brains compensate for his physical appearance. Piggy is the first person Ralph meets on the island and they quickly become friends. Piggy is very supportive and defends Ralph whenever he needs defending.  Towards the end of the book, Piggy finds himself in deep trouble with only Ralph as a friend.<br />Lord of the Flies is filled with contrasting characters.  For example, Jack is the leader of the gang.  He has a posse of followers who will do whatever he says - good or bad.  Jack is insecure and thinks that if he can't boss someone around that they are a threat.  In the book, Jack is the opposite of Ralph.  On the other hand, Ralph, the main character of the story, is a true leader who wants to get everyone's input before he makes a decision that affects everyone.  Ralph's only goal is to maintain order on the island while Jack's goal is to do what he wants.  Therefore throughout the book, there is a constant rivalry between Jack and Ralph.<br /> When civilization rapidly turns to chaos, someone will rise and someone will fall.  Is it Jack or Ralph who will take command of the island and lead the boys to safety?  If you want to find out what happens to Ralph and all the rest of the boys, read Lord of the Flies.ut the book, there is a constant rivalry between Jack and Ralph.

I'd read this a long time ago and I thought it was good then but I certainly didn't appreciate the complexity of Golding's characters.  This succinct book is at the same time childish and grownup, able to marry the two in to a cohesive storyline.  I am much more impressed this second time around.<br /><br />The hard part is showing how the children got on to the island because it would be a little hard to show a realistic plane crash on to a deserted island and still have survivors.  In fact, where is the plane and what of the other dead children of the plane?  This is exactly why this is all left unsaid because it leaves the unknown and mysterious as something that is altogether believable.  Instead we start by following two children who find a way to call an assembly and form a somewhat organized society.  Yet right away you see the cracks that will form.  You see the childishness that is throughout the book.  The insanity that could come of isolation from grownups.<br /><br />The accurate portrayal of children is what strikes me.  The younguns who play and eat, not really understanding what is going on and yet still scared and frightened.  The biguns trying to act grownup and organize everyone into a little society, and yet still frightened.  The three most important, of course, are Ralph and Jack (on equal footing) and Piggy, to me the main focus of the whole book.  Where Ralph and Jack act the biguns they still represent children, unable to keep their emotions in check.  Ralph is the leader who slowly loses his train of thought and his focus the longer they stay on the island.  Jack is the hunter who loses his mind as he cracks under the pressure of hunting, only to find that actually succeeding sends his fragile mental state into a much worse situation.  Piggy, of course, actually represents the smarts of the group, the one who could have led them to a much more seamless survival if he only had an ounce of leadership.  It is ironic, then, that he died at the height of the \\"civilized\\" children turning into savages.<br /><br />All in all a well rounded book that has lasted for over fifty years for a reason.  If you've never read it, read it.  If you've already read it, read it again.  Definitely a fun book to read.<br /><br />4.5 stars.ivilized\\" children turning into savages.

US	49939297	R1K2ZG6G6GQ9S3	B000FXT2LA	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Miscreation Myth	The two boys we meet on the first page of \\"Lord of the Flies\\", Ralph and Piggy, are as freshly minted as Adam in the Garden or the earth/ice gods of Greek and Norse mythology. Born full-formed, they are pre-modern, utterly unsurprised by their own existence. They are no more plausible as 12-year-old boys than the usual totemic first humans of \\"creation myths\\" from cultures around the world. Plausibility is not the objective of myth; moral instruction is, and \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is plainly intended as a morality tale illustrative of human nature, which is depicted as innately savage, held in check only by authoritarian social structures and above all by \\"rules\\".<br /><br />Reading \\"Lord of the Flies\\" as a version of Genesis does make the story clearer, though I make no claim that such clarity was William Golding's intention. But: A) they're in a garden paradise; B) `Woman' has not yet been created; C) fratricide, the Cain and Abel story, is central; D) Yahweh, in the form of a Grown-Up British naval officer, makes his judgmental appearance in the end.<br /><br />\\"Lord of the Flies\\" can also be read as science-fiction. Most critics have taken it as an apocalyptic parable, an `end of the world' scenario, with the boys as the only visible survivors of a world war. End of humankind, beginning of humankind, take your choice! Of course, without girls, without Eve, humankind wouldn't amount to much. If, indeed, the boys were being transported to the island, or to some other custodial location, the reader will have to puzzle out the survivalists' intent. If, on the other hand, these boys -- all British but of mixed ages -- were on a flight somewhere and were stranded on the island by a crash, the questions brim up faster than the tide. Why didn't any of them know where, why, how, or what? On a plane of the size Golding could have imagined, wouldn't they have at least noticed each other while boarding? The `creation myth' reading eliminates some of those questions; the boys popped into existence on the island without real-time antecedents, even though they were created with the illusion of prior-life memories.<br /><br />Implausibility in the cause of plot development is one of the constant weaknesses of second-rate science fiction. \\"The Lord of the Flies\\" is riddled with implausibilities small and large. My guess is that William Golding had less than no experience with the outdoors, other than English playing fields. Let's get persnickety for a moment: 1) The boys start a fire INSTANTLY with sunlight through the lens of Piggy's glasses; Hah! I'd like to see that done! 2) The naked or nearly naked boys, with their tender English feet, scamper over coral and volcanic rocks all a-jumble, and through palm and bramble thickets, at the speed of thought on the typewriter keys; Golding had clearly never attempted hiking off-path in his life! 3) The island is straight out of Disneyland! If it's big enough to support a population of wild hogs, to have running streams of fresh water, and to feature a peak as high as described, then the boys COULD NOT possibly cover the territory they do in the time they're allotted, any more than Jack Bauer could drive from edge to edge of Los Angeles during a commercial break! If the island is as small as it has to be for the final `hunt' to make sense, then it's too small for any other item of the story to compute. There are also some ecological illogicalities, the strangest of all being the presence of those pigs without any history of human settlement. Honestly, as a narrative of `survival' in a hostile or indifferent environment, \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is less realistic than \\"The Hatchet\\", Gary Paulsen's classic for young readers.<br /><br />In short, William Golding knew absolutely NOTHING about nature! And knowing nothing about Nature, how can his depiction of Human Nature be considered meaningful?<br />That's the burning question for me, in reading this rather childish portrayal of the innate bestiality -- the \\"original sin\\" -- of our species. Frankly, I think \\"The Lord of the Flies' is fatally dated; it's a specimen of the mindset of the year it was published, 1954, at the beginning of the Great Fear of nuclear destruction. It dates from an era when the implications of evolution were just beginning to dawn on middle-class literary Joes like Golding, but long before any combination of ethology and evolutionary psychology had begun to probe the roots of social-ethical behavior.<br /><br />Is it still worth reading? Yeah, it's kinda fun. Does it have depths of insight in the human dilemma? None that I can take seriously. Should it be a standard reading choice for school children of any particular age, as it has been? Is it actually a book intended for \\"young readers\\"? I'll have to leave those questions for teachers to consider..

It regularly appears as number one on my own list of best books.<br /><br />Let's play \\"What if.\\" What if a plane carrying a full load of school boys crashes on a deserted island with no adult survivors? What would happen to those boys? What would you expect to happen?<br /><br />William Golding works with this premise: an idyllic setting, innocent schoolboys. One boy, an older boy just short of teenage years, a boy with fair hair, assumes leadership to stir the others into some semblance of organization and survival mode, much like adults would do if adults were present. He also saw a need to defuse the web of fear of the younger ones. Where are we? How long will we need to wait before someone comes for us? All questions with no answers at this time.<br /><br />Ah, yes, Golding tells us, everything goes well for a while. But remember the \\"scar\\" made by the crashing plane? Something ugly is on this island (but it's not the scar). It's in the bushes, in the dark, in the depths, in the depths of hearts, and it grows like the malignancy it is.<br /><br />A blatant revelation of what is about to come occurs when Roger silently and stealthily watches a young'un, unbeknownst to the little child. All the young'un is doing is running a stick through the sand, disturbing a crab in a tiny pool of water. Even he imposes control and fear on a helpless creature as Roger boldly picks up a couple of rocks and tosses them the youngster's way. He deliberately misses but comes closer with each throw. Next time he will probably hit the young boy, but not yet. This taboo--deliberately and unnecessarily causing pain to one smaller than you--has not been broken--yet.<br /><br />Although the dance of the spears, the primeval chants, the attack and killing of the pig, then feasting on its flesh, their kill, are shocking acts of savagery, this event is foreshadowed by the seemingly innocent lob of the stones. From a casual incident, but one with eventual intentionality, the ritualistic slaughter is not so far-fetched or surprising. Golding prepares his readers. This is how the chaos of society starts. It begins with one simple disconnect from the rules. It begins in the minds and hearts. Will I do what society expects? Will I follow the rules to keep things running and working? Do I break a rule or two for my own enhancement. Will I feel a power surge if my rock hits that young `un?<br /><br />Ralph would probably speak of the terror of knowing that rules WILL be broken. He would speak of the utter horror that any rule can be and will be broken and he won't live to tell about it. Just ask Piggy.<br /><br />This novel is the only one I taught over and over during the twelve years I worked with high school seniors. My other choices I would switch around those years, drop some, add some. This one I kept. It is that important. I think of \\"Lord of the Flies\\" as a necessary manual for societal behavior and an effort to keep the chaos of evil at bay.<br /><br />Is it even necessary to ask how many times that rock has been thrown since this novel was published in the 1950's? Or how much chaos has imploded so many lives?<br /><br />Like the way of manuals, some remain in circulation and are deeply read; others fall by the wayside out of disinterest. Some are thrown in the trash. \\"Lord of the Flies\\"--what is its current status? And society--how is it doing? Reader, are you a little bit fearful?s.

Borrowed extensively from R. M. Ballantyne's The Coral Island, Lord of the Flies is set on an island that acts a microcosm of WWII. The school boys demonstrate what Golding believes will happen should man be unleashed into the wild with no society to monitor his actions, what will happen when man gets in touch with the primitive evil inside him. Using supposedly innocent children to enact this tragedy, Golding makes his message even more daunting and thought-evoking.<br /><br />In the midst of war, a plane evacuating a group of school boys from Britain is shot down over a deserted island, far off course. The story follows the boys' attempts to survive and to be rescued. It follows their process of electing a leader, the battle between Ralph and Jack, and the island's descent into chaos. This novel is pretty intense. The allegorical struggle between good and evil is suggested in the title of the novel. The title is said to be a reference to the Hebrew name Beelzebub (literally \\"Lord of Flies\\"), a name sometimes used as a synonym for Satan.<br /><br />The story, which seems to be another survival story, keeps its readers engaged with the tension contained in the calm yet eerie narration. The mystery laced yet seemingly uneventful opening of the novel immediately captures the attention of readers and holds them in a sort of frustrating suspense as they wonder about the meaning and significance behind the introduction. As the story develops and the island is enveloped in madness, the reader wonders in horror at the savagery such young and supposedly innocent children are capable of. Without any sense of morality and other societal influences, children are the perfect subjects in this examination of true human nature.<br /><br />The syntactical structure and the abundant imagery truly make Lord of the Flies a graphic and daunting read. Variations in syntax between long, continuous lines and choppy, rhythmic sentences help readers visualize and relate to the situation in the book. Be it the pounding nervousness as their camp is invaded by children gone wild, or the frightening image of the \\"lord of the flies,\\" each scene is intensified by the author's mastery of language. It helps a reader further delve into Golding's microcosm of humanity as the boys' descent into savagery threatens our faith in the good of humanity.<br /><br />Despite the magnificence of its message and the remarkable skill with which this novel is crafted, I definitely do not count Lord of the Flies as amongst one of my favorite books. I personally felt that Golding was far too pessimistic in his view of humanity. While the story does serve was a frightful caution sign, it does not reflect the whole of humanity. Golding seems to have been greatly affected by his experience in WWII. It is true that war brings out the worst in people, but it is also true that war and savagery do not define our existence. Perhaps I am simply far too optimistic but I feel that just as there is innate evil in the world, so is there innate good. That is why the struggle between good and evil is a ever present theme in both literature and life.<br /><br />Lord of the Flies is a great read if its allegorical message is taken with caution. Its deeply developed characters add complexity to this mind shaking story. The suspenseful plot in addition to Golding's eerie narration makes Lord of the Flies a novel that will leave you shivering.

CHAOS!!  A recent example of the 2003 blackout in New York will suffice as citizens pillaged and raided stores stealing valuable and causing destruction. A more detailed example of lack of authority occurs in Lord of the Flies by William Golding, a thriller to say the least, takes the audience on an exciting adventure through the gates of social construction.  Golding creates a world of chaos and freedom when a group of British school boys become stranded on a desert island.  A struggle between the \\"rational\\" the fire-watchers and the \\"irrational\\" the hunters creates a whole new idea of complete freedom and independence.  The boys split into two groups until the hunters lose all humanity and begin to hunt down the fire- watchers.  The unusual plot makes the book a great read as Golding takes us into a possibly realistic situation revealing the human necessity of rules and boundaries.  Lack of social control is a great theme in this book as wants and temptations cause selfishness and separation.  I recommend this book to high teenagers and above allowing the readers to retain the full experience and meaning of the novel along with the ample symbolism and irony that occurs in Lord of the Flies. Golding is able to successfully show the fragility of civilization and what is needed to keep people in control.  The major consensus that this book is an allegory of World War II makes sense as barbarism and war take place of cooperation and friendship.	2009-06-08

If the book is read at an elementary level, it is merely an adventure story, but at the upper levels and college level, it is a satire that grips the reader and illustrates the reality about human nature. The story is set during World War II, where a plane carrying young British children crashes on a remote island. The children initially try to organize themselves, as you would expect highly civilized, British children to do. But then, some of these children realize that they are in complete control, that there are no adults on the island to monitor what they are doing, and this is when the primitive human nature starts to take over. They start with killing pigs and eating them half raw, blood dripping everywhere, and they end up killing three innocent children until they were rescued by none other than a cutter, which just goes to show the warring, disgusting, and primitive nature of humans that they have no control over. Golding uses this novel to introduce to us our basic and primitive instincts that emerge in the absence of civilization. He wants to show us that man is born into sin and he is a fallen creature by nature.<br /><br />A special part of the story is the symbols. The Conch that Ralph uses to call the others is seen as a symbol of authority. Whoever has the conch is the leader, and when the conch is destroyed in a tussle, it signifies Jack's victory; civilization is out. The forest on the island itself becomes a symbol of the location of darkness and evil. There are so many literary features to this novel that it makes it a joy to read. Easily one of the best books I've ever read.<br /><br />-David Brehm	2009-06-08

The boys on the island start civilized and organized, but quickly break away from civility and erupt into chaos. Golding offers highly developed characters such as the main character Ralph; he starts out as the chief of the boys. He is a suitable leader, and he represents what is right and logical. Another boy who becomes his adviser is piggy. He is not respected on the island, but Ralph sees that he is actually very wise and values his ideas. The antagonist of the book is jack, who you will learn to hate throughout the book, at first he seems like a simple bully, but as innocence is lost form the island he turns into a controlling dictator.<br />What is so interesting about this book is the spontaneous events that keep you interested. Right when the book starts to get slow at some times, Golding introduces a new struggle or something new on the island. The theme of this book is the loss of innocence of the boys. At the beginning are an organized democracy, when times get harder on the island the boys could go as far as murder just for the pure bloodlust of it. It shows that when boys have no supervision or adults implanting good morals on them they start wondering how much they can get away with. Golding shows that society on the island it not responsible enough to plan for the future and instead they just give into simple wants. This is allegorical for Freud's theory of Id, ego, and superego. The boys lead on the island, lead by jack are the id. They only follow simple wants and do not look at the bigger picture, This proves harmful because a group of boys without w set of rules and only governed by simple wants turns into savagery.<br />The Lord of the Flies is more than just another survival story; it had a much deeper meaning. One of he characters in the story is a perfect example of a Christ figure, he represents what is innocent and pure, but he passes along with the presence of innocence on the island.<br />William Golding does a wonderful job of supplying very distinct images on the island. His writing style changes throughout the book from calm and orderly to chaos and complete anarchy. He supplies very tense moments and exciting events on the island. He doesn't get too much in details with the character's emotions, he doesn't go out and say them. He has a way of showing the characters emotions through their actions towards other characters.<br />I suggest this book to anyone who will enjoy a thrilling plotline. This is a very suitable book for young adults around 9th and 10th grade. This book is also very intriguing for any guy. Girls can enjoy it, but I think that it was more aimed towards guys. It teaches good moral lessons about how order is necessary to survive and we a nothing but savages without it. The Lord of the Flies is an excellent piece of literature that will be read for many years to come.re, but he passes along with the presence of innocence on the island.

In this enticing novel, Golding illustrates the effects of society--or lack of it--on our human nature. He argues that human beings in a society need set of collective guidelines to keep order and prevent chaos.<br />Golding uses thoughtful symbols on the island to enhance his book. The conch is the symbol of order in society. Just landing on the island, the boys first used the conch to assemble and to speak, eventually, however, they got rid of it, and chaos started to reign.<br />Besides the use of sophisticated symbols, Golding assembles very thoughtful characters to form his plot. Simon's encounter with the pig's head makes him the Messiah archetype, or the rational being on the Island who alone discovers the spuriousness of the Beast. Beside his parallel encounter of the devil in the wilderness, Simon is the ultimate sacrifice who gets killed by his evil friends. Ralph is the primary representative of order, civilization, and productive leadership in the novel. While most of the other boys initially are concerned with playing, having fun, and avoiding work, Ralph sets about building huts and thinking of ways to maximize their chances of being rescued. Jack is the novel's primary representative of the instinct of savagery, violence, and the desire for power, making him the antithesis of Ralph.<br /> I personally learned a lot about group work from this novel. Personal themes that I found important were: staying focused on your goals and take your responsibility seriously.  In the novel, the goals of the boys started shifting, from lightening a fire to be rescued, to killing the Beast and chasing a wild dream of their imagination. Because the boys digressed from their supposed roles on the island, and instead roamed the island hunting and searching for the Beast, they turned into savages and delayed their rescue. Also responsibility is a huge lesson in the novel. When a ship passes by on the horizon one day, Ralph and Piggy notice, to their horror, that the signal fire--which had been the hunters' responsibility to maintain--has burned out. Jack and his followers not only ruined their own chances of being rescued but their friends' as well. To be successful in a group project, as a whole we must focus on our goals and not get distracted. In addition, each person might do their responsibility well because other group members are counting on them.<br />Overall I thought Golding's novel had strong themes with great usage of symbolism.ich had been the hunters' responsibility to maintain--has burned out.

I started each unit with a \\"free-for-all\\" day, an entire class period in which I said nothing, gave no instructions, and wore a sign that read \\"I'm closed for repairs.\\"  I did this with ten different classes and each time chaos ensued.  As soon as students realized I was present but not really there, they tested the limits with what they could and could not do.  Since I told myself that I would only break character if a student's well-being was at stake, the students quikly realized they could get away with a lot. Leaders emerged and some kids tried to be somewhat productive, but the outcome was always dismal and disturbing.  One time all the desks were piled into one heap as if they were going to be a part of one giant bonfire.  This was always an interesting introduction to the book since the students quickly made the connections when they started reading the book.  I am a very positive person by nature and tend to see the best in people, so some of the truths in this book are hard for me to acknowledge. However, Golding hits us with the reality of our hearts smack dab between the eyes.  This book is a fascinating read that will force you to look closely within your own heart while also reminding you to be a little more cautious when trusting other people's intentions.	2009-01-02

I would describe the plot basically as all about blood nothing much too it just a couple of boys marooned on an island and nothing to do but kill other things, well i won't tell the whole story cause that would just give the book away. Lord Of The Flies is not based on an true story obviously. If there was any other books to come out like Lord Of The Flies I probabaly wouldn't read it just considering it wasn't my type of book to read. I read more of comedy, and ect.<br />When your reading thiis book you can basically look at it as a movie it runs through your head and you can have a clear picture about all of the details and blood.<br />Consider reading the back cover of the book and notice that the author William Sir Golding is writng this book based on the 20th century european fiction.	2008-05-22

At first i wasn't impressed but as i progressed through the book i realized how complex and interesting it could be. Key word being could. My best friend read the book a week before i did, we have different teachers, and the only thing she got from the novel was a cute adventure story of boys trapped on an island who go crazy. I couldn't believe she didn't see the significance. I was most interested is Golding characters like Simon who has Epilipsy and is almost a mystical, godly, all knowing character. Ralph represents democracy while Jack represents communism or totaltaliarism. I love how the characters could be fit into Golding's time. My teacher assigned us to write a criticism research paper of Lord of the Flies.

This tale about a band of lost boys marooned on a remote island while the adults wage war across the human civilisation is very entertaining and a swift read.<br /><br />A small novel, it starts off with how a bunch of disorganized kids install a council for the safety and sufficiency in their island refuge and the unanimous leader Ralph is envied but accepted by a better behaving marching troop's leader - Jack.<br /><br />The conch is the symbol of power and authority vested in Ralph. The conch is passed to whoever wishes to speak and everyone listens. With such a good start you would expect them to get better. But these are human children with their innate savage instinct. And now with an island to explore and rule on they get initiated into barbarism with the hunt for a pig, supported by a hunting song, killer's dance and more.<br /><br />There is lot more to it than children's games here. There might be a monster on the island. Ralph and Jack will of course compete in this new hunt to prove bravado.<br /><br />Deaths of kids are mentioned with good subtlety in this novel and mystery is created with simple scenes/words. With the eventual break up of the council and savagery rampant in the island it is up to Ralph to restore normalcy and his rightful place as the leader. The mindsets of different kids is shown through their actions.<br /><br />A great parable for human wars and human nature, this book may leave you depressed even though the ending is safer than the kids' island adventure.	2006-12-28

Although it's been 50 years, his story remains timeless. It deals with the pure essence of what it is to be human, and how it is to loose that humanity. The event begins as a group of boys find themselves alone on a deserted island after a severe plane crash; they are quickly drawn toguether by a conch blown by Ralph. Since the very beggining of the book a conflict of interest is noted between Ralph, the leader; and Jack, the hunter. This conflict does nothing but expand and broaden, until finally all hell breaks loose. Lord of the Flies is more than a story, it's a walking breathing epic of symbolism, as colourfull, lively and destructive as the human race itself.	2006-11-11

The central symbol of The Lord of the Flies is that of a pig's head upon a stick stuck in the ground, a totem in the making perhaps, but seen by Golding as Beelzebub, the \\"lord of the flies,\\" the devil, a head of rotting flesh enveloped by flies.<br /><br />The central idea is that without civilization we will degenerate into predatory animals ruled by superstition, the will to power, and the primordial need to survive.  When Piggy's glasses, which symbolize the tools and knowledge of our culture are broken, it signals the degeneration, the return to the wild in which, as Thomas Hobbes has it, there are \\"No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\\"<br /><br />That a group of English school boys could degenerate so quickly after crash-landing on a deserted island may be seen as a bit fanciful, or more exactly, as the artifice of the artist; nonetheless, the premise of this extraordinary work may well serve as a cautionary note for our times.  Should we, through nuclear warfare, a runaway greenhouse effect, sectarian violence on a global scale, or through the exhaustion of the fossil fuels that power our civilization, regress to the state of savages, we have this warning.<br /><br />Instead of the noble savage, instead of a return to the Garden of Eden, instead of the Swiss Family Robinson or Robinson Crusoe, Golding takes us step by step from the world of the boy's school to life and death power struggles and a fascination with savagery to the beginnings of tribal warfare.  As in The Inheritors, Golding sees not the good in humans, but the viciousness.  In The Inheritors we homo sapiens murdered the gentle Neanderthal, here we children become gangsters of the island, on our way to becoming tribal chieftains as murderous and vengeful as the God of the Old Testament.  I understand that Golding wrote the novel in part to answer the pollyannaish naivete of R.M. Ballantyne's The Coral Island (1857), which I haven't read.<br /><br />Clearly cruelty is one of Golding's main themes.  Left to their own devices and without the restraint of civilization's justice, humans will be cruel sometimes just to be cruel and sometimes as a means of gaining power.  The boys Ralph and Piggy naively try to set up a democratic sort of government, but are defeated by the brutality of Jack and his will to savagery.<br /><br />The loss of innocence that the boys experience is seen as not the loss of something they intrinsically had, but of something superimposed upon them by civilization.  In reality, Golding is saying, there is no innocence in children, that is only a fairy tale idea to which we romantically subscribe.<br /><br />This is one of those novels that has found its way onto the high school or even the middle school curriculum because it is easy to read and because it is easy for young people to relate to.  But the strength of this novel lies not only in its theme and readability but in the fine characterizations of the individual boys.  As in all great works of literature, it is the combination of character and story that compels us to turn the pages, and invites our admiration.<br /><br />It should be noted that Golding deliberately left out one of the central drives of humans, probably because he did not want to muddy up his theme of savagery, or perhaps because he felt the task too great or perhaps because he didn't find the task palatable.  I am referring to the lack of sexuality in the novel.  Not only are there no girls on the island, but the boys do not, at least overtly, involve themselves in sex.  We can see that Golding's artistry anticipated this criticism since it can be argued that the boys in this situation and at their tender age arenot yet ready to express themselves sexually.  I wonder if postmodern psychology would agree.  Certainly Freud would not.<br /><br />Bottom line: a great read, a terrific adventure, but not a book in my opinion that should be read by preteens, in other words, you need to be older than the characters in the book in order to read the book without fear of nightmares.ender age are not yet ready to express themselves sexually.

To be a child again in this life is always welcome and this story pulls it off very well.	2006-10-26

It's the most boring read of any story I've ever heard in my life. Golding's a great writer, but he ain't no reader. His own commentary in parts is distracting and irritating. His mouth noises unsettle me, and his slow, dull, expressionless rendering of this classaic grates on the spirit. Too bad an accomplished reader such as Roger Dressler or Garrick Hagon can't do this novel justice. It's just a damned shame is all.	2006-09-30

So I decided to read the mother of all high school English books.<br /><br />I came to the text with certain preconceptions and prejudices. Like many high school students, I was force-fed my share of meaningful stories with something to say. I though To Kill a Mockingbird was simple and didactic, and, after two readings, I cannot comprehend what any serious person sees in The Catcher in the Rye. In Cold Blood and The Stranger were more my speed, stories with the confidence to tell their tales and not hit you over the head with life lessons. I approached Lord of the Flies with wariness.<br /><br />The story is well known. A flight filled with English schoolboys crashes on an uninhabited island, killing all of the adults. Ralph, a charismatic but forgetful 12-year-old, is elected the leader of the survivors, who quickly segregate by function. Ralph determines the day's tasks. Fat but smart Piggy counsels. Jack and the members of his boys' choir hunt the island's wild pigs. The \\"littluns,\\" the six- and seven-year-olds, exist in a task-less state of near hysteria.<br /><br />Jack, the warrior prince who provides meat, becomes envious of Ralph's position as leader. The principal arc of the 200-page book is the heightening tension between Ralph, whose priority is to maintain a signal fire and be rescued, and Jack, whose priority is to hunt and lead.<br /><br />Many passages were suprisingly clunky. Dialogue sections repeatedly ignored Strunk and White's admonition to \\"make sure the reader knows who is speaking.\\" Author William Golding devoted substantial space to physical descriptions, but they tended to be vague and confusing. Many of the secondary characters were cardboard, as thinly drawn as in Dickens but without the cartoonish charm. The narration's point of view changed abruptly at certain points.<br /><br />Lord of the Flies was Golding's first novel, so imperfections can be forgiven. He was ultimately awarded the Nobel Prize and a Booker so, to paraphrase Shelly Winters, some people thought he could write.<br /><br />But what is it about this book, an almost archetypal \\"promising\\" first novel, that has landed it on so many required reading lists? Lord of the Flies has sold more than 10 million copies, deep into Dan Brown territory, and my raggedy paperback is the 96th Capricorn printing. (Interestingly, the book initially flopped, selling only a few thousand copies.)<br /><br />Much of the success of Lord of the Flies must be due to the fact that it is a useful tool when teaching some of the basics of literary theory.<br /><br />First of all, kids will read it, especially boys who may not be the most avid readers. The idea of a world without grown-ups catches adolescent interest. The book is short. There's a fair amount of action, including a taut climax.<br /><br />Moreover, the Big Themes are laid on with a backhoe. The symbolism is so obvious that the slowest kid in fourth-track English can figure it out. A student can spend hours matching the characters with their analogues in modern society and, judging from some of the web pages devoted to the book, students have spent much more time than that. Every high school English teacher needs to explain that sometimes there's more to a story than what the characters do and say, and Lord of the Flies feels custom-cooked for that effort.<br /><br />I don't think Lord of the Flies has much to offer an adult reader, but it's a pleasant reminder of youthful efforts to learn the rudiments of symbolism and subtext.<br /><br />Now, class, what do Piggy's glasses represent?ng's first novel, so imperfections can be forgiven.

Although we are conditioned for a civilized society, Golding makes the compelling argument that if left to our own devices, we will revert back to our primitive roots, one where survival and savagery triumph over order and rules.<br /><br />Golding's tale could be described as an allegory of law vs. anarchy, and civilization vs. savagery.  After a harrowing escape and crash landing on a deserted Pacific isle, a group of English boys, escaping a cataclysmic atomic war with the Communists, quickly organize into a rudimentary society, with Ralph as their elected leader.  Ralph symbolizes the leadership and good of society.  Piggy, the corpulent advisor to Ralph, represents the intellect and common sense in society.  Jack, Ralph's nemesis, represents the corrupt power-mongers who use fear to rule their minions.  Simon, an enigmatic but sensible boy, represents the kind and charitable in society, and proves a martyr in the end.  And finally, Roger, sadistic and inhuman, symbolizes the pure evil that plagues society.<br /><br />As the boys descend further into savagery, their desire to be rescued becomes non-existent.  Instead, they are content in their animalistic rituals, and become enamored of violence and adrenalin-fueled hunting expeditions.  Their concern for others collapses, as Jack becomes the tyrannical leader of a rival tribe, and eventually all succumb to him.  Although they arrived on the island as innocent victims of a horrific war, they lose their innocence on the island as evil creeps up from the recesses of their soul.  Even if they were to return to society, they will never regain their innocence.<br /><br />Although Golding tells a moral tale, there is no shortage of action.  From the chaos of the initial plane crash, to the fear of a \\"beast\\", to the final heart-pounding hunt of Ralph, \\"Lord of the Rings\\" delivers a chilling and exciting tale.  I honestly cannot find any downside to this book.  This is a superb read and is highly enjoyable.a chilling and exciting tale.  I honestly cannot find any downside to this book.

I had no idea what it was about as I have never been required to read it. I only recognized the title. Having now finished it, I can say it has been one of the most thought provoking stories I have ever read. While many have reasons to regard this as a depressing yarn of our humanity, I find myself uplifted by the message and the symbolism found throughout the novel.<br /><br />The story follows the adventures of a band of British boys who are marooned on an island. At first the children seem much like the lost boys of Neverland, but the world in which they live is far more real and unforgiving.  The boy with the fair colored hair named Ralph is appointed the leader and with the aid of his faithful sidekick Piggy, he attempts to maintain order among the multitude of boys.  What begins as simple fun on the island quickly becomes a nightmare as Ralph begins to realize that the scariest things don't come from the outside, but from within.  At the end of the story all childlike innocence is lost forever.<br /><br />The symbolism and parallels to our time were amazing. William Golding had this to say in regards to the book's theme:<br /><br />\\"The theme is an attempt to trace the defects of society back to the defects of human nature. The moral is that the shape of a society must depend on the ethical nature of the individual and not on any political system however apparently logical or respectable. The whole book is symbolic in nature except the rescue in the end where adult life appears, dignified and capable, but in reality enmeshed in the same evil as the symbolic life of the children on the island. The officer, having interrupted a man-hunt, prepares to take the children off the island in a cruiser which will presently be hunting its enemy in the same implacable way. And who will rescue the adult and his cruiser?\\"<br /><br />While this message is among the most obvious, there are several other subtleties that can be found within the tale. The following are some of the main symbols:<br /><br />The conch: An effective representation of order and society's sophistication.<br /><br />The glasses: The glasses symbolize the gradual deterioration of society. Notice as the glasses get damaged so does the boy's organization.<br /><br />The beast: 1) The irrational fears we all harbor. 2) The inner evil within humanity. 3) The idols of society.<br /><br />Ralph & Jack: Ralph is the head of democracy while Jack represents that of anarchic rule.<br /><br />Just in case you missed them, there are several other symbols which are worth looking up.  Wikipedia currently has a good article as well as some other sites. Run a search online and you'll find plenty of interesting interpretations. Many of the symbols can be interpreted as Christian, but make of them what you will. Observing these will give you a greater appreciation for the story and not leave you wondering if it's some senseless tragedy.following are some of the main symbols:    The conch: An effective representation of order and society's sophistication.

I, of course, read the book, but did so with pain.  This is not a long book, but not short either.  It took me about a week just to read all 208 pages.  I was unimpressed by the topic of this book, several young British boys stuck on an island, and in my opinion, this author was in la-la land when he wrote the book.  Although this is just my opinion, it was agreed on by my father, who read a small ammount while he waited for me at an appointment.  If you love fantasy stories about people on deserted islands that try to form a government and fail, then resort to killing each other, this is definately the book for you.  This is not a book I would recommend for those my age, 14, at all.  I will say, however, that the ending reflected the main idea of the story and was excellent.  The book was still difficult to read and I hope this review will warn you.	2006-08-08

So, after hearing good and bad about it I decided to give it a try.<br /><br /> I am sure everyone reading this is familiar with the story, but even if you already know it, nothing prepares you for actually sitting down and reading it. In fact, I would say that it worse when you knew what would happen. Golden presents an interesting character study that can be taken in numerous directions. As soon as the story opens we see who is who and the individual character traits for the boys and it quickly becomes apparently which boys will turn. This is not to say that the book is predictable- it's just (for lack of a better reference) like watching a car crash in slow motion.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone. It's a very easy read and the story is one that you can interpret in all different ways.	2006-07-30

From the Class clown who disrupts classes to the Bullies who stalk the Hallways of our Schools, soccer hooligans and after football riots, modern crudity at every level, the Criminals who contemptfully operate in a society whose penal system is eager to parole them back out but refuses to maintain order in its own ranks expecting utopia to come about from the mess it has made through its own 'elightened' stupidity, these are the those boys in real life.

The Lord of The Flies is a gripping book that takes you through the lives of a group of young British school boys whose plane crashes and leaves them fighting with nature and each other to stay alive and make it off of the isolated island. The group of boys try to start their own low class government and constitution, but when one of the young boys can't face this new government he breaks away and starts his own government which throws the island into a form of civil war. One by one each of the boys begin to lose their sanity and began eliminating each other. It shows just how easy it is for a group of normal civilized human beings can drastically change into inhuman and insane human beings when the stress and the extreme possibility of death is near. This book is riveting and emotional that proves that even the most civilized and disciplined people can turn into insane psychopaths. I highly recommend this book.	2006-05-12

It is extremely easy to read, mostly fast paced, and very insightful.  Golding has many points that he makes in this novel.  To name just a few:<br /><br />1.  The form of government does not matter so much as the character of the individuals being governed.  The best government in the world will fail if those being governed have poor character.  A democraticly ruled island of criminals will likely be worse off than a country of well-to-do people ruled by a dictator.  Ralph's government fails, not because it is necessarily a bad form of government, but because of the character of the boys on the island, who easily fall prey to the ideal of Jack.  Golding is saying that the problems in our society are not due to the form of government that we have, but to the moral character of the citizens of our country.<br /><br />2. The decay of belief in rationality.  Piggy represents rational thinking.  His glasses are broken part way through the book, and he can no longer see clearly.  In the end, the school-boys turned savages kill Piggy, signifying the death of rationality.  Goulding was mourning the slow decay of rational thinking in the West, and it can easily be seen that it has now decayed beyond what Goulding was appaled at, as postmodernism has openly rejected rationality.<br /><br />3. The Freudian concept of ego, superego, and id.  Other reviewers have already explained this, so I will not simply repeat what they have said.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a classic for a reason:  it is well written, and expresses the philosophy that Goulding pulled out of the 1950's.  It is a very well written tragedy, and deserves to be read.<br /><br />Overall grade:  A.	2006-05-04

You have the Lord of the Flies.  Written in the mid 1900s by William Golding, this book is one of the last in a long line of English works that explores the relationship between society and the lone individual.  Other works of this nature include Robinson Crusoe, Gullivers Travels, and Ulysses.  Specifically, how much of the evil in the world (the Western, Anglo-Saxon world) is due to the effects of society restraining the individual, and how much is due to the individual himself?  These questions and the related issues of freedom, law and order, respect, competition versus cooperation, are all explored in this book.<br /><br />In short, a plane full of English schoolboys crashes on an island in the Atlantic ocean.  Slowly, the various survivors find each other and try to form some semblance of a society from which they came from.  Tasks are delegated, and roles taken on as they fight for survival hand-to-mouth.  But soon, some of the party discover that life is more fun if tasks are shirked, and they revert to a more primitive state of hunting and killing.  The boys divide into two groups; Ralph who tries to keep them in a semblance of civil society, and Jack who leads the downward spiral into primitive fury.  Jack's group slowly morphs into a bullyish gang and begin killing the others in a game of predator - prey.  The killing comes to a sudden stop when society reimposes itself in the form of a rescue ship.<br /><br />Published at the height of the Cold War, this book is quite complex in its treatment of story and characters.  Many themes of both a personal and political nature are included.  This reviewer read the book during his early teens, and found it too complex to fully understand at that time.  This is probably the youngest age at which this book should be read.  The book is considered a classic of English literature; though I believe it should be cited in classes of political theory, sociology, and the other social sciences.  Most importantly, I believe this book more than any other, exposes the psychological foundations of Anglo-Saxon culture and society by showing what happens when those raised to be part of it are removed from external controls.  The boys' ensuing behavior reflects, to me, an upbringing of rod and beatings, drills and formalities characteristic of the English school system.  I dare say that a more enlightened upbringing, along the lines of Rousseau's Emile, would not have created such monsters in disguise...  All in all a great book though.sic of English literature; though I believe it should be cited in classes of political theory, sociology, and the other social sciences.

The kids in the book represent how mankind would be without any rules or restictions.  It shows how as a society we could not function without the presence of a formal government.  The boys that get stranded on the island, quickly forget about the laws that they used to abide by.  They become savages on this island and soon violience becomes an everyday occurance.  The kids would of continued their savage behavior if not for the interference from the outside wolrd.  Symbolism is a big part of this book.  Most ideas in this book should not be taken literally.  The island that the kids landed on represents the world.  The conch represents law and democracy.  The conch is the only thing that all the kids listen to and follow.  When ever they hear it they always meet.  The \\"beast\\" represents the darkside within everyone.  The beast does not actually exist.  It is just the kids excuse for violence and death.  This book exposes human nature and how we would act if not for the laws that we are forced to follow.  When the stronger kids see that they can get power, they do anything to achieve it.  They do not care if they have to kill oposing forces.  Overall I enjoyed this book because it made you think why we need a central government that tells us what to do.  Without it there would be chaos, which is what happened in the the book, The Lord of the Flies.	2006-03-20

With no parents, teachers, or rules, is there really any question as to why the characters in Lord of the Flies by William Golding had no mercy?

They try to form a society and govern themselves, but not long after, the boys are having chaos for breakfast and anarchy for lunch. The book reminds me of the movie Thirteen, only the male version.  In Thirteen, the main character goes to shocking lengths to befriend the most popular girl in school. Before her mother knows it, she is powerless to rescue her daughter from a whirlwind of drugs, sex and crime). They both, I find, are not shocking at all. This is the way people today are, to say you were shocked is saying your living your life blind. Ralph is your typical guy in high school who is unsure of himself and just watches the bully pick on the little kid. Jack on the other hand is the jock/bully who everyone \\"admires\\", whether it is in fear or respect. Simon is the artsy type. He is out of the box and in his won world. Piggy, a very intelligent boy would be your \\"nerd\\" who stands up for what he believes in. The Lord of the Flies is a well written book full of truth. When you read the story, don't be disgusted. Ask yourself \\"what would I do if I were twelve years old and stranded on an island?\\"	2006-03-02

Unfortunately this reading by the author isn't all that great. For one, it's dated and the audio quality suffers from that. There is no consistency in the sound so one minute he sounds okay and the next as though he's stepped away from the microphone. Another annoying factor is the breathing and sighing while he's reading making the whole thing sound like a chore.

It depicts, in chilling detail, how civilization breaks down when a group of school boys, none over 12 years of age, are marooned on an island, with no adult supervision.<br /><br />It can be read as an allegory for adult society in which there is no responsible supervision, for example, when the government appoints people to head agencies who have no experience, like Brownie, or appoints people to agencies that the government wants to destroy, or when the government appoints a person to represent us in the UN and the person has said the UN should not exist. Does this sound familiar?<br /><br />However, this book first appeared in 1954. It is a work of art. It may be just an artistic description of some school boys slowly descending into a violent abyss of their own making.<br /><br />Either way, it is a disturbing book. It shows, clearly, how thin the veneer of civilization is, and what ugliness lies beneath that veneer.<br /><br />I have read this book twice and was disturbed both times. I think it is still relevant. And that relevance makes the book even more disturbing.	2006-02-06

The book begins with British boys all of decent and educated backgrounds stranded on a island with no adults. In the book, the boys are initially led by a sensitive, smart, and logic driven Ralph and a competitive, ambitious, and instinct driven Jack. The group of boys initially all have meetings where their opinions are regulated by a conch found by Ralph and Piggy, Ralph's assistant. Gradually, the delicate friendship between Ralph and Jack breaks, and rivalry, savagery arise. The boys split up into two groups, each an enemy to the other, and conducts actions even to the most brutal degree, murder. As superstitions and fears arouse, the boys created a beast out of their own uneven emotions which became the centerpiece of the story and at the same time an excuse to all actions as more and more, the boys shift their blame to the imaginary beast.<br /><br />Everything in the book possesses great symbolic meaning. Piggy, who throughout the book was Ralph's assistant, represents society's intellituals, who despite their brilliant minds and common sense, are condemned for their lack of expression and appeal. Ralph represents leadership and justice, and the beauty to the human nature while Jack in contrast, shows the instinctive beast that dwells in all humans. The conch, which at first was in effect during meetings, represents democracy and the freedom of speech for only with the possession of it can a boy speak. The beast, the ultimate focus of the book, is a creation of mankind's own fears and insecurities. The book is brutally beautiful; it reveals to us a side of human nature that many thought was nearly impossible and also, the delicate exterior that we call civilization.	2006-01-14

These young boys are shown things that many of us have never seen and that we will never see. They escaped Europe because of a war and their plane crashed so they ended up on an island, no one knowing who or where they were. The boys are afraid of a \\"monster\\" but in the many reflections of symbolism in this book, they are the monster. They boys start out being civilized and end out becoming savages. The idea of an utopian society is seen throughout the book. The boys first believe that the world will be great, a world without parents, adults or teachers to scold. They thought that the world would be so much better on the island. It shows that the utopian society does not work and will eventually become corrupted.The end of the  book takes an interesting turn and will suprise everyone who has ever read it. It is defidently a book to read for all ages.	2006-01-13

First all the boys crash on this deserted island after being shot down by a bomber. Within a few days they burnt down half the island killing a boy and broke up into groups with a killing machine and a democratic leader. Needless to say they start by killing the weakest and last killing the smartest. The only problem with this is that they are only twelve year old boys who at the very least could have a civil war within a matter of days.<br /><br />  I think Golding had a great point of what a society would do to itself and he showed the power children had which was in fact, just a minor display in comparison to the great civil wars within our own countries. The only deal with this is that it wasn't very believable. Aside from that he perfectly displayed his point. He portrayed every character as a crucial member of society. You have Ralph who's the democratic leader believing in order, Jack who was the dictator or person that believed in his own way, Piggy the smart one who had all the right ideas, and Simon who was the more spiritual one who rather would do his own thing and believed in helping others and looking out for the smaller weaker children. You could see this in each person and connect in some way because Golding always displayed them doing the very things you saw them out for. At any rate I would at least say read it.	2006-01-11

In the first coulpe of chapters you find out that there is two boys in the beginning are just two really firghtned and scared boys and they remeber what happened to them.  As they get more and more into this place they found out that this is an island and there really isnt any possible way for them to get out of this place.  The weridest part of this book is the boy piggy and the other boy ralph find this conch shell and when he puts his lips and blows the conch it brings all of these other boys togther.  Ok in personal opion when you blow a conch shell it gets loud but it doesn't tell all the other boys to come to this place where they blew.<br /><br />More and more into the book the boys who were like they don't need there parents and start relaizing that there helpless and cant do anything about it.  When they realzie they don't have there parewnts to help them that means they cant gget for them selves.  They cant find any food or any thing to drink so they going against each other and start getting crazy and start attacking the leader of the group and that's ralph and piggy.  Ok I thought that this part of the book gave it some snare and razzle-dazzle and kid of explains what really happens when oyur on island with no food or water.  It really helps the readers to explain what reaaly happens to a person or a kid when they have nobody to help them.<br /><br />The ending of this book was really surprising because as soon as ralph runs out of energy and speed he drops and falls and as soon as he was aout to get killed... something out of the blue happens but I cant tell you.  But when you read this book you find out about the character and yourself.	2006-01-10
US	52909137	R1V76X9396LCO4	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	3	4	9	N	N	They Never Had a Chance	After more than half a century William Golding's first novel still has the power to chill the blood with its cautionary tale of the degeneration of a group of castaway schoolboys into the depths of animal savagery.  However, as a criticism of more optimistic boys' adventure stories, as a critique of democracy, or as anything much beyond a warning of the obvious, that young children, especially young boys, must be carefully civilized (and continually re-civilized), it's a failure... because Mr. Golding cheats.  Though Mr. Golding would no doubt claim (with justification) that boy's adventure authors tended to stack the deck in favor of their protagonists, Mr. Golding does the opposite.  His characters never had a chance.  A comparison specifically with R. M. Ballantyne's [[ASIN:1592245064 The Coral Island]], referred to in the novel, and generally with other boys' own adventures should suffice to prove the point.<br /><br />AGE: It is no accident that boys' adventure stories tend to feature teenage protagonists (Ballantyne's were 18, 15, and 14) because a certain amount of maturity is necessary to make them even plausible.  It is therefore no accident that Golding's oldest \\"biguns\\" are only 12 while the \\"littluns\\" are as young as 6.<br /><br />TRAINING: It's easy to forget that the concept of \\"childhood\\", the idea that those under the age of majority should be allowed to \\"play\\" and be sent to school rather than being put to work as soon as they're able is a relatively modern idea.  Now, no one in his right mind would suggest going back to the old way of raising children, but it did have the singular advantage of better preparing children for being castaways.  Ballantyne's protagonists are sailors in training; Golding's are a bunch of schoolboys.<br /><br />NUMBERS: Though the primary reason is probably ease of storytelling, the number of characters in a boys' adventure novel is usually kept to such a manageable number that there is no requirement to establish of any sort of \\"government\\" in order to get things done.  Golding has so many characters that they never even manage to count themselves!<br /><br />PRIOR RELATIONSHIPS: Almost invariably boys' adventure story protagonists are close friends before the crisis hits; with the exception of Jack Merridew's choir (and the twins of course) none of Golding's protagonists even knew each other before the plane crash.<br /><br />RELIGION: Karl Marx had it partly right, religion IS the opiate of the masses, if by opiate you mean balm to and healer of the soul.  Religion can give you courage and strength where there is none, and it helps you to do the \\"right thing\\" even when no one is looking.  This makes it very useful in a crisis where group survival depends on something other than \\"looking out for numero uno\\" though it can lead to sacrificing oneself for others.  Ballantyne's protagonists were surprisingly (at least looked at from today) devout Christians.  This gave them the courage to face a horrible fate, though said horrible fate was the consequence of risking their lives for someone else.  In contrast though all of Golding's protagonists are presumed to be at least nominal believers in SOMETHING, there is no evidence of religious belief in any of their actions, which hastens the death spiral of their little society.<br /><br />CHARACTER: This is the critical matter, as even Mr. Golding would admit, so it comes as no surprise that his protagonists only run the gamut from A to B, from evil to useless.  Ralph, the \\"bigun\\" initially chosen chief is all but completely lacking in leadership skills, not to mention being something of a dolt.  He is (just barely) capable of grasping what needs to be done, but utterly incapable of convincing anyone, not even himself, to do it.  Piggy, the only one who can honestly be called \\"intelligent\\", is also fat, weak, asthmatic, socially inept, whiny, and blind as a bat without his glasses.  (Gee, Mr. Golding, why didn't you make him wheelchair bound, too, so he'd have spent the entire novel crawling on his belly?)  Samneric, the twins, are utterly incapable of functioning separately.  Simon is kind and gentle and helpful, though a little bit balmy, but too young and too inarticulate to have any influence.  Jack is a megalomaniac, and Roger is a sadist.  The \\"littluns\\" are just barely capable of feeding themselves, which is fortunate because no one else is going to do it.  The wonder is not that three boys died, the wonder is that any remained alive!  If they'd crash-landed in a temperate climate, no one would have survived the first night below freezing.<br /><br />As a commentary on democracy, Lord of the Flies is of little use because there isn't any democracy in the novel!  (Despite what the Colonial Office might claim, \\"one man, one vote, one time\\" is not a democracy!)  Though Golding's depression is more understandable when you remember when this was written, the reason he turned out to be so wrong about democracy is that he failed to grasp its strengths: democracy, especially constitutionally limited democracy, is the ONLY Earthly form of government even capable of long term functioning with wicked, sinful citizens because no other form of government has solved the problem of succession.  Democracy does not claim to always install the best leaders; it merely offers the only peaceful and practical method for removing the worst.  If Jack Merridew had had any prospect of winning some future election for chief, he might not have found it necessary to resort to violence.<br /><br />Finally, in regards to the last page remark, \\"I should have thought that a pack of British boys... would have been able to put up a better show than that...\\", I'd argue that they did better than a similarly handicapped group of primitive tribes-children would have.  Sure, the education received by the primitive tribes-children would have prevented many of the bone-headed mistakes committed by our young bulldogs, but the weaker taboo against violence, especially in the area of settling political disputes, would have made the crisis worse when it came and the death toll much higher, if only because primitive tribes-children would be expected to be a lot more competent at killing each other.wling on his belly?)

The book was good but even though it is a classic it was not great in my mind. One of the big things that I feel makes this book a classic is that the story is susposed  have underlying meanings and what happens on the island is a reflection of human nature with philosophical implications etc. I honestly wouldn't have figured it all out if I hadn't read the notes at the end but after having read these it made since. It didn't take away from the story not having realized the underlying things.<br /><br />The Good: The characters were fairly well defined and even though there were quite a few on the island only the key figures were focused on. You forget how cruel kids can be and are reminded when you read this. Their ignorance is made clear (as is always the case when around kids) which made them real. I would actually find myself getting frustrated along with Ralph while he is trying to manage a group of kids who he cant get to listen.<br /><br />The Bad: Nothing really. At times the story seemed a little slow. It seem kind of hard to believe since it's only about 200 pages but it was.<br /><br />Overall not bad but not great either. I think to much credit is given to the intertwining of his underlying ideals. If a story is trying to prove a point that's fine but you cant take away from a story in order to wrap it around the ideal. I base my ratings on how enjoyable the book is to read instead of how much a literary gem it is considered to be. It is worth giving a read though.	2005-12-15

At first, I wasn't sure if I was going to like this book or not.  I was just going by what some of my classmates had said about it.  It turns out they were right, and I loved this book.  Golding was able to grab my attention right from the beginning of the novel and keep me interested all the way to the end.<br /><br />The first few characters that the author introduces you to are Ralph and Piggy.  These two form a strong friendship after finding each other on the island.  Their plane crashed on an island, and a group of young boys are the only survivors.  Now, Ralph, Piggy, and Jack become the leaders of the other boys in order to survive.  These normal boys turn into savages after they feel like they must fight for their food and lives.  It is a great struggle for these boys all the way to the end.<br /><br />The authors use of imagery really made me feel like I was one of the boys lost on the island.  I could picture everything that was happening to them.  It is extremely scary to think that this could happen, and you feel much saddness for these boys stranded on the island.<br /><br />For those who love books with lots of adventure, Lord of the Flies is the book for you.  You want to see these boys be rescued from their nightmare and that is what keeps you reading.	2005-12-14

At times, I felt so desperate to be saved and so utterly terrified by the thought of the impending disorder and absence of authority, that death seemed a better fate than continuing to exist in that place. The book often made me feel helpless and scared; I can only imagine the loneliness and despair Ralph endured. I wanted more than anything for him to be able to click his heels three times and get back to his safe world of horses and clean sheets.<br /><br />  While the events surrounding the crash onto the island are unclear, one thing is for certain, this situation is the perfect set-up for a display of the true nature of man. The differences between Ralph and Jack are obvious, and those differences represent the various battling forces in today's society. Personally, I find the topic rather disturbing. The way the boys slowly transformed into savages--forgetting things like compassion, honesty, and trust, in their relentless hunt and lust for meat, deeply bothered me.<br /><br />  I cannot say that I loved every second of this novel, mainly due to its subject matter, but Golding's imagery is fantastic and his characterization is wonderful. I don't believe that a better book could be written about this kind of topic. If only it had been about puppies and sunshine.	2005-12-09

Mostly everything in this book, has a double meaning, or stands as a symbol for something else in the world. Even the characters in the book, if you think about it, stand for some kind of person or some kind of stereotype of a person. The island that they crash land on is an allegory, or a symbol of the world. I think that the conch shell stood for authority, and in the world, would have been the government. This is an awesome book for people who like finding the deeper meanings of things, and for people who take the time to analyze novels. While you are reading this book, I would suggest that you take the time to analyze and think about the comparisons the author is making.	2005-11-23

It was a revelation to the real world. Golding is an awesome writer with a brilliant mind, he uses allegories and everything is a symbol. All of the characters stand for something or a certain group. For instance jack stands for the bully and piggy stands for intelligence and civilization. The conch stands for order and authority and the paint the boys put on their face stands for chaos and savagery. My favorite part of this book was the death of Simon. It was so brutal yet it added so much meaning and mood to this story.In this book the author is showing us how we as humans behave and how our actions affect us. How we are all savages in reality even though some are worse than others. This book shows how the island was like a miniature world and how humans would act. The intresting part about this book was that at the time it took place a war was happening. The events related to what the adults were doing at the same time. I think that you should read this book in order to understand correctly our nature.	2005-11-23

One of the things I enjoyed most about this book is that everything has a deeper meaning then you think. You have to try to thinik beyond what the words say and you have to have a big imagination. The only thing I didn't like about the Lord of the Flies is the deaths that occur in the story. I say this because I prefer to read happy and cheery books and the deaths in the story sort of brought me down.<br /><br />I think other people would also like this book. I say this because most readers like to read books that they can relate to, and in this story there are a wide variety of people that anyone can compare himself or ferself to.	2005-11-23

I mean it is crazy how the boys are fighting and what saves them is a killing machine, its almost like its a continuous circle.I really like this book it kept me on the edge of my seat.  How mean some of the boys were made me mad. I thought it was really sad that ralph told everyone the fat boys name was Piggy and you never really find out his name through the story. If anything in this book bugged me it would be the fact that it doesn't continue on and tell you what happens to everyone. The part in the book that stuck out to me the most was the death of Simon because it was intense, I thought it had such meaning and depth, because it was the death of all reason. I loved that when simon died Golding said the trees and water drained color, becuase it was such a great personification. I would say all the similes, personifications, and metaphors as well as the main plot and what the story stood for really caught my attention. I wonder if this book would be re-written in about 20 years if anything would change? i wonder if the nature of people would change? This book is great and I would give anyone the advice to read it because you won't regret it.	2005-11-22

It really makes you think. Everything you read has another meaning to it. For example the island they are on shows what is happening in the world. As they fall apart the world is too (the world is at nuclear war). The island is like a small version of the world or a \\"Microcosm\\". This book is not too long but is very difficult to understand. I found myself needing to read the chapters multiple times to understand them, but it is worth it. I recommend that everyone reads this book.	2005-11-22

Everyone knows a Ralph or Jack in their life. What I liked about his book is how Golding can make the island a symbol of how the world is. Also he makes symbols of all these important things so once you actually read it carefully you get the real meaning of the book which is how mankind is actually is. What I didnt like about the book was that it only had boys. It seems like if males can only survive or if they're more better than females. I would recommend this book to anyone in high school or older but mainly to high school age students since this is a book that makes you relate to all the characters in the book.	2005-11-22

Also main objects in the book have deeper meaning and stand for something in the world. The island that the boys crash land on is an allegory to the Earth. The conch shell is govenment. This is a good book for people how enjoy serching for allegories and can take the time to relate the book to our world.

The reason that I liked this book was that Golding did a good job of making the book and allegory and he used the characters to show human nature how it can be good but mostly savage. I would think that people that like this book are the people that like to read story for the deep meaning and not have everything told to them and use their imagination when they are reading a story. So overall I thought that Lord of the Flies was an okay book.	2005-11-22

Golding writes of a group of boys who were stranded on an unknown island and how the boys work differently on how to survive.  Their human nature and true personalities are exposed after spending some time on the island.  The boys break off into two different groups for the remainder of their story.  The leaders of the groups were Jack and Ralph.  Their groups were also known as the \\"bounty hunters\\" for Jacks group and \\"fire inhibited\\" for Ralph's group.  Jack's group is thought to just want to kill and eat and then they repeat.  Ralph's group wants to keep a fire going so hopefully someone near might spot them.<br /><br />  The Lord of the Flies is an excellent example of how we might actually act when the rules of society are taken away.  I think this particular book is a pessimistic novel.  Even though Ralph's hope of survial brings assurance and optimism, Jack's group discourages our hopeful thoughts when they become like savages.  Jack's inhumane acts exudes at its highest when it is pure darkness and all he could think about was killing the pig. The story turns when Simon got in the middle of the savages but the boys thought Jack was the pig and forced themselves upon him until his flesh had met their mouths.  They decided he wasn't palatable and they just left him lying there to rot.  In certain situations, especially when it depends on your survival or life to death, your true self becomes more visible.<br /><br />  I enjoyed reading this book even though it seemed pessimistic.  I thought it was interesting to look at how some might act expecially in closed-in situations which Lord of the Flies provided.  Lord of the Flies definity helped broaden my thoughts and horizons on how to look at certain situations or why a person might act a certain way.  It was easy to read and I recommend it for teenagers to read.  I would rate the book a four out of five so it was definitely worth the time of sitting down and reading it.four out of five so it was definitely worth the time of sitting down and reading it.	2005-11-22

This book has it ups and downs. I think that the only way that you would be able to enjoy this book is if you start thinking deeper into the story. I liked this book because you can think deeper into it and it makes sense and it explains a lot. If you think deeper into the story then you can enjoy the book so much more.<br /><br />  This book is pretty much a allegory book. An allegory is a story or tale with two or more levels of meaning-a literal and a symbolic meaning. The characters in the book stand for something else. This is a hard book to understand for that reason. Once you thin it through and think of what the characters could be resembling then you can understand the book more. I didnt understand the book until my teacher started telling the class that the characters stand for something or the symbolize something and then I understood it and got into it a lot more.<br /><br />  So if you are looking for a book where it gets you to think and it has a deeper meaning then this is the book for you. If not the I dont think that this book is for you.	2005-11-21

Golding brings these kids on this island where they will have to face many challenges and fight with life and death.<br /><br />He brings mankind and civilization together and makes the island like a war against nature. My opinion is when he creates the plots and description of the story he describes the characters and the island and the plots so well. I like how he makes the story like giving us a sigh of the world we live in today on how the world can be so cruel and evil but the outcome of it can be very good.

Fortunately, I discovered this masterpiece on my own.  I loved the sparse, yet effective writing.  I was captivated by the struggle of these boys to survive on their own.  And, ultimately, I was stunned by the quick spiral into chaos that reflects the heart of mankind.<br /><br />Golding never bought into the idea of humanism.  He was courageous enough to face the truth of our own depravity, rather than joining the crowds of his day that shouted \\"man is basically good.\\"  Even without a religious compass, Golding accepted that men, left to their own devices, will seek their own satisfaction, egos, and control.  His startling use of children stranded on an island demonstrates this theme with brutal power.  Even in the end, when adults step in, we see the children's bleak future in the shape of a battleship.<br /><br />You may agree or disagree with Golding's ideas, but few can discredit his ability to challenge our preconceptions in a book half the length of most masterpieces.  \\"Lord of the Flies\\" showed me the power of fiction to communicate ideas, and for this reason I've pursued my own career as a novelist.  I owe Golding a debt of gratitude.	2005-11-05

Obviously not...you probably haven't heard of the social nature of groups in distress situations or distribution of responsibility.  I'm guessing that you have no idea about anything, really.  I say this because the themes in this book are not too complex.  LOTF covers the basic arguments of human nature that have been explored in the 20th/21st century...but, you were born in a cave so you missed all of that.

There is a lot of symbolism, and the themes and ideas are abstract and become apparent only with deep thought.  Yet the implications the author makes about human nature, about ideas we purport to hold so dearly - \\"civilization,\\" \\"democracy,\\" \\"morals\\" and \\"decency\\" - are worth the effort it takes to read and digest.<br /><br />The story line is simple enough - a plane of young boys crashes on a deserted island, and the kids must make the best of it.  What ensues is a gradual, downward spiral into barbarism and authoritarianism.<br /><br />It is a brilliant book, making one wonder just how thin the line is between acting like an animal and giving in to our more atavistic side, or attempting to cooperate and behave in a \\"civilized\\" manner.<br /><br />Perhaps Freud (and Jung) got it right - inside each of us is the shadowy remnants of our more primitive ancestors, struggling to get out.  We see it every day on the news: the violence in our communities and around the world.  And as we sit in our comfortable homes, we have the audacity to wonder \\"how can this happen?\\"  Perhaps Golding got it right when suggested that the Beast is within all of us.  Highly recommended reading.	2005-10-27

Golding helps illustrate the thin line between civility and sanity.  He illustrates this by showing the behaviors of the boys stranded on the island as they lose their sanity and start to kill one another.<br /><br />Golding starts the novel by introducing the main character, Ralph, as he is swimming and looking for other survivors from the plane crash.  Ralph meets a young boy named Piggy and they start to look for other young boys.  Eventually they find a conch and Ralph blows it to call all the boys that are on the island.  Once all of the children arrive they have a meeting and choose a leader.  Ralph was chosen as the leader.  When Ralph was chosen as a leader, a boy named Jack starts to rebel against this decision and he gets some of the boys to join in on his rebellion.  As the story starts to be more developed, Jack and his followers start to disobey all the rules and then eventually create their own tribe.  As Jack's tribe becomes more uncivilized, they start to torture and kill some of the boys from the Ralph's tribe.<br /><br />William Golding shows how even the most innocent children can become uncivilized and dangerous due to the lack of authority, government, and other forms of guidance for a child.  I would really recommend this book because it is a very interesting and worthwhile book to read.  It will help you understand the need for authority.	2005-10-21

It was wonderful in every way- its symbology, dark undertones of human emotion and archtypes, and murderously well-done plot. One who thinks that this book is about a couple of boys stuck on an island randomly fighting and killing each other is superficial and quite frankly, stupid. This book is riddled with important messages about human nature and society, and much can be learned from the mistakes of these unknowing children. Golding's knowledge of ancient concepts of human nature, and also his accurate use of Freudian archtypes serve to deeply complement and better this wonderful book. I recommend this wonderful novel to any literate human being.	2005-10-16

What is presented to students across the country as a kids' adventure story is far from it. It is a timeless statement about the nature of human beings, who may fundamentally be innocent and civilized, but can quickly degenerate into adversarial brutes when they become free from the reins of authoritative supervision or isolated from collective notions of propriety. The chaos and terror that Golding so palpably illustrates results from Jack's pride and his ability to garner followers by appealing to their weakness during trying times. But perhaps this was only possible because of the lost--or killed--hope of rescue. This rescue was for a time the unifying and motivating vision that formed the basis of the children's activities on the island, and the eventual arrival of the rescuer is the moment of truth, when the depth of this tragedy is fathomed, and the aggression from Jack's camp becomes apparent to everybody. The novel is more than a chilling tale; it serves as a warning to us, who inhabit the island called 'Earth,' that if we allow our actions and egos to go unchecked, and if we lose hope in the future, then our fate will be dismal. It also exposes the precarious nature of civil order from beneath its veneer of stability. If we value order and harmony, then we need to appreciate that contravention of even simple standards of civility (e.g. speaking without the conch) may spell the beginning of societal decay. I would highly recommend (re)reading this book, because our society needs greater human consciousness.	2005-10-02

It was a required reading work, a rite of passage work for any young person who wished to know the ' literary conversation- pieces' of the time.<br /><br />And it is a ' gripping narrative' a read that holds the reader's interest, especially as it is written in a clean, spare, very understandable prose.<br /><br />Yet I must admit the violence and cruelty which are the central message of the work in regard to what human nature is in essence, turned me off. As an adolescent dreaming reader I was looking for works which would give hope and faith in life. On the adolescent level 'The Catcher in the Rye' moved me to rereading again. And on the more adult level 'War and Peace' seemed to show the complexity and beauty of life in a way which made ' Lord of the Flies' seem to be a narrow- minded cartoon.<br /><br />We may be bad and evil sometimes, and many of us may be bad and evil all the time, but not all of us are evil all the time.<br /><br />The book to use a Faulkner phrase ' had no redemption in it'. And so while I respected it it fell far short of winning my approval and love.	2005-09-01

But it is, in its own way, and hopefully will remain so. In this Golding novel, society is held up for us to look at, through the actions of a few stranded boys on an island. Metaphors abound, and for good reason: Golding is trying to teach us something by putting our own society's evils on display via a group of gone-wild adolescents. And it works. The unfortunate thing is that we, as a society, seemed to not have learned the lesson Golding was trying to teach. This is a classic, stellar book with a superb message--if only we would listen. Would also recommend two other books as we read them in lit class: CANNERY ROW by Steinbeck, BARK OF THE DOGWOOOD (I think this one's getting banned), and OF MICE AND MEN.	2005-09-01
US	16468831	RLFNOJBIVZBG3	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	5	1	2	N	N	One of the darkest and most symbolic parables ever told	Golding's Lord of the Flies is so brilliant because it manages to succeed on two separate levels of writing and tell two completely different tales at the same time.  The first way to look at Lord of the Flies is to view it as a dark adventure story about shipwrecked young boys struggling to survive on an island in hopes that help will find them.  If Lord of the Flies was only about this idea it still would be a very good novel, but like all the great novels of the century, Lord of the Files takes us beyond a simple tale of adventure in to a symbolic, surrealistic parable dealing with the inner world of the human condition.<br /><br />The story, on its surface is very simple.  A ship is wrecked and many young British schoolboys are abandoned on an unknown island, far away from any adults.  The main characters come off as realistic, never over the top, but completely grounded and hold true to form throughout the novel, even if they do change and evil envelopes some of them.<br /><br />We have Ralph, most likely the main character of the book.  He is the protagonist, but a deeply flawed individual.  He has spasms of pride, anger, and fear, but he seems to be the most in control of himself.  He is, at first elected chief of the island, but soon social order breaks down and chaos emerges.  Jack is our antagonist, but it is a slow regression.  At first, Jack is likable enough, but because of his pride and jealously, it ultimately leads into his dissention down to evil.  Jack becomes the leader of another tribe of boys, basically Golding uses these to boys to separate good and evil.  There are other vital characters as well.  Simon is a confused and good spirited child, but eventually stress overtakes him and he begins to hallucinate and lose his mind.  Tragedy also strikes him in one of the most eerie scenes in the novel.  We also have Roger, who seems almost sinister from the get go.  Golding uses words to symbolically describe Roger and the negative influence he will have as the novel progresses.  Finally, we have Piggy.  He is your typical outsider.  Piggy is a boy that a school class would make fun of.  He wears glasses, but is outspoken instead of withdrawn, as we might typically expect from people similar to him.  He is one of the most complex, intelligent characters in the book, even if his backbone is not sturdy.  There are other characters in the story, but these five are the anchors.<br /><br />Lord of the Flies is not so much concerned with story as it is with symbol and its characters.  The story really doesn't exist.  The boys get stranded, fight over who should be king, hunt for food, try to survive, and eventually cave and crumble under the stress of the situation they are in.  The boys act and think a bit old for their age, but that is expected in a parable such as this.  I don't believe Lord of the Flies was written mainly for plot and story, but to expose the idea of humans left to their own devices with ultimately result back to being carnal and evil without a proper environment to shape them.  Although this is the main idea, I believe, Golding is smart enough to let us know that this is not the condition that ultimately will happen to humans left on their own, but rather what could happen.  Otherwise, why would we still have characters in the book that never do result to being carnal and evil, such as Ralph and Piggy?<br /><br />There are many things to admire in Lord of the Flies.  One is its hypnotic, descriptive imagery.  One reads this novel more like a dream, a nightmare, than a straightforward tale.  There are multiple references to the heat, the sun, and the cliffs, all which serve as underlying symbols.  Apart from that, the struggles described here concerning the boys are astounding.  One of the landmark scenes is Simon's hallucination with the talking head of a boar which foreshadows things to come.  This is a completely realistic portrait of what it might be like to go insane.  That is one amazing scene.  The closing scenes when Ralph is running and fleeing are scary and tense, and it is hard to remember that we are dealing with just boys.  There are two deaths that occur in the novel.  They are graphic, painstaking, but at the same time mixed with a level of profound solitude and depth that are vacant from most novels.  We feel everything going on here: the sadness, the joy, the loneliness, the fear, the isolation, the frustration.  Golding does a superb job of allowing the readers to feel these emotions rather than telling them they should.  Good books always do that: allow their reader to think freely and make up their own minds about ideas presented and give the reader emotions to remember.  Lord of the Flies follows this pattern to perfection.<br /><br />People who take Lord of the Flies as just a simple adventure story are missing the big picture.  This is a book that requires more than one reading.  There is so much depth, so many symbols, and so many ideas about the very nature of humans it is a lot to take in, even though it is only a 200 page story.  A story that reads like a dizzying nightmare, but at the same time feels so vivid and realistic.  Lord of the Flies is one of the most well written, dark, frightening, and enthralling books I have ever read and I know that it will be re-read again sometime in the near future.<br /><br />Grade: Ae amazing scene.

Golding tries to convey his beliefs in the innate evil in individual humanity through a story wrought with simplicity.<br /><br />Golding does a great job in developing the characters of LOTF. The characters (unlike the 90's movie) are quite believable. Each of the main characters have their own personality and are utilized by Golding to symbolize his ideas.<br /><br />Golding uses a lot of imagery and symbolism, but he does this in a manner that is easy to understand. His writing style is simple and clear and without all of the complex language that can bog down a good novel. This story flows at a nice pace and never seems to \\"drag on\\".<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel. Underneath the symbolism there was a fast-moving, suspenseful story.

US	15482533	RY72X9QUE032W	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Misunderstood genius	This review comes as a response to some of the other reviews on the site. Before I actually review the story, I'd like to respond to several accusations made by others.<br /><br />1) Some say that Golding's writing style is too slow when dealing with the environment, sun setting, etc., but very abrupt when dealing with death. The reason for this abruptness is to underline the character's nonchalance about death and dying. They don't care if Piggy dies, and the book is written to feel the same way. The writing that is long about seemingly unimportant things is only to create a mood, although, to be fair, mood need no be created with such laborious attention to detail.<br /><br />2) Several reviewers made the point to say that most teenagers don't talk the way the characters in the novel do. Well, of course they don't. The teenagers are merely a metaphor for the adult world and all of it's pompousness.<br /><br />3) Lastly, it should be mentioned that the beast is more important as a metaphor than as an actual thing, i.e. the children's irrational fear drives them to madness. But, you do in fact find out what the beast is, in a short passage of the book. If you watch the movie, it will become even more obvious.<br /><br />Now, on with the review.<br /><br />This was William Golding's first novel, and it is a classic. There are some problems with the writing, but the same can be said about most amatuer writers. But writing, in this novel, takes a back seat to Story and Message. Their are several different messages you can take from this, but this edition contains a section called notes on Lord of the Flies if you've read this and want to further your understanding of the novel.<br /><br />In the end, this is a very desparing story of humanity, with a few flickers of hope. This is a good place to start if you're begining to read deep literature. Supplemental works could include 1984, Fahrenheit 451, and A Clockwork Orange, because while this doesn't take place in the future, it might as well be a dystopian novel about the evils of government by tyrants.place in the future, it might as well be a dystopian novel about the evils of government by tyrants.	2005-08-13

The plane crashes and the boys are left stranded on a tropical island without adult supervision. William Golding' novel allows viewers to observe the transformation of even the most well behaved children when left to their own devices. Innocent at first, the boys contrive a make-shift hierarchy based on English society and parental mores. Soon however, a subtle inclination allows the more aggressive side of human nature to evolve and a split divides the once tranquil group. What follows is the natural tendency of mankind to revert to a more primitive and prurient structure resulting in animal dominance, religious fears and murder.

Techinally I read it as a class assignment but never actually finished reading the book if you can believe that! Well its been over 5 years since I last looked at it and decieded that it was time to finish it. And i've been happy with my decision ever since.<br /><br />The book is about 20 or so british children (mostly under the age of 13) who are stranded on an uncharted island with nothing but the clothes on there backs. There plane was damaged durring a storm and basicly crashed on the island. The oldest of the survivors is the main character \\"Ralph\\" who becomes the appointed leader. Ralph's main goal is to get of the island alive. A goal that was dire to the survivors at first but over time it becomes less and less important. Ralph becomes over thrown by \\"Jack\\" another boy his age who feels that meat is more important than a fire signal. Jack's charater is sort of wild and will go to any measure to gain power over the younger boys. Jack's test of power is measured when he finially kills a pig to prove that he could do it. And as time goes on, his power to kill spreads so that anyone who defies him will be delt with or killed.<br /><br />The only thing that I didnt like about the book was the ending. I would have liked to know more about what happened to the boys mentally after they were rescued. Like were they able to cope with what they had become which was almost like animals. But I did like the main point of the story. Which is, to me, that anyone would do anything to survive.<br /><br />I loved this book so much that I read it in 2 days and I strongly suggest that you do the same.

None of the adults survive so they are left there to survive on their own. One of the boys, Ralph, is quickly chosen as the chief leader of the group over the book's antagonist, Jack. At one point, while exploring the island, the kids see something they believe is a beast. Later, Jack, Roger and Ralph see something that they believe is a beast, and so, there becomes an emphasis to find out exactly what it is. The fear of the \\"beast\\" is probably one of the main issues in Golding's work, because it creates the breakdown of their ability to work towards rescue. Eventually Ralph's authority over the others diminishes, and he cannot control the malevolent tendencies of Jack, who, impatient with Ralph's ideas, eventually breaks off and forms his own \\"tribe.\\" Two of the boys, Piggy and Simon, stay loyal to Ralph while one by one the others leave Ralph's group. While Piggy is intelligent and Simon is individualistic they both have trouble enforcing leadership, and so Ralph's cause to keep the fire going becomes less and less important to the others.  Jack's group gets more and more brutal and rebellious, hunting pigs and using clay to look the role of a tribe. Chaos and disorder ensue, and the brutality of individuals without rules surfaces.<br /><br />While this story is more symbolic than anything else, what was refreshing was Golding's ability to create well-rounded characters. Each of the main characters (Piggy, Ralph, Simon, Jack, Samneric, Roger) are depicted effectively both from the dialogue and writing style. Golding is not the type of author that is just going to come out and tell you something about a character or situation; many times you have to make up your own judgment and inferences about motives and dig for some type of meaning.<br /><br />What also makes this book powerful is the several poignant issues it brings up. First of all, Golding examines the issue of what it would be like to have to survive in a situation where you are surrounded by peers, where laws are not part of the society. He seems to be making a pessimistic inference about how we operate when we let chaos or fear control ourselves, rather than being rational and objective towards common goals. Some of us may have at one point thought of the idea of being stranded somewhere and how we would react: this book addresses that idea and the difficulties that arise when one or more people rebel against individuals. On the surface this book may just seem like a story about kids not getting along, but in an allegorical and symbolic sense, there is something much deeper taking root which displays the darker side of human nature in individuals.<br /><br />I found that this book was more meaningful and enjoyable the second time I read it. I admittedly wasn't that much into it the first time, but the parts that we a bit unclear made more sense the next time I tried reading.

I just need to look at the cover to get shivers down my spine. Lord of the Flies is a horrifying piece of fiction about how cruel, hideous, even, no, especially, murderous a group of boys could become, left deserted on a desert island with no one to trust but each other, no resourses but the island, and no adults in sight. This is not a flurry little kid's book with a morel about a happy band of friends and their adventures on a desert island. It is about young boys with real feelings, real emotions, real fears. It is about a bullying scenario that goes majorly overboard. And it is about choices, which is more important, to be safe or to insure the safety of others, to follow the crowd of bullying, brutal persons, or to stand up, even if standing up could cost you your life.<br /><br />In &lt;Lord of the Flies>, as I've already said, a large number of boys end up on a desert island after a plane crash. You never find out where or why they were going, which leaves it free for you to imagine. Ralf, a determined boy, though by no means perfect as he has the tendensy to bully a fat boy whom he christened 'Piggy', takes leadership. At first all goes well, apart from squabbles over leadership with Jack, a tyranising boy with a thirst to kill. Then the boys decide to light a fire to attract the attention of boats on the ocean that could rescue them and one boy of about five years disapeers. Was he burned to death by the uncontrolable fire? He was never found. It only went down-hill from there. All of the boys but Simon, my favourite character, refused to help make shelters. Jack and his choirboys went on mad hunts in the hopes to catch a wild pig. When they finally did they impaled its head on a stick and began to worship it. Simon could hear it talk to him and slowly began to go insane. The younger children were afraid of a 'monster' which one is lead to believe was really a lost, dying parachuter. That's when the total choas and brutality of the boys imerges. They divide into two groups, Jack's and Ralph's. Jack's group steals Piggie's glasses to create imense fires. They sharpen spears for the kill and create death machines out of boulders. And their target is Ralph.<br /><br />Lord of the Flies will haunt you with its beautiful writing, disturbing plot, and terrible reality until the end. When I finished it I was sobbing.

Two college degrees and a lot of time later, I am not sure what I was thinking.  What I saw in the book then, I can not find now.  Coming from an era in which literature had a greater market, this book achieved notoriety.  Released today, I suspect this book might be a failure.<br /><br />A plane crash leaves an undetermined number of boys on an island to fend for themselves.  The idea that the children must live independent from adults is an interesting premise.  While the story itself is interesting, it is difficult to identify with any of the characters.  Ralph, the original leader of the group, is weak and a poor leader.  His lack of focus and self-loathing make him hard to empathize with.  Jack, the second leader and founder of the hunters/savages, is a megalomanical monster.  More than anything, he needs a good old fashioned beating from his father.  The most sympathetic character is Piggy, the obese and asthmatic voice of reason.  Unfortauntely, the other boys would rather mock him than listen to him.  When Piggy dies, I found myself wishing that the rest of the boys would starve to death, never being rescued.  Unfortunately, the boys are rescued.  Despite irrational fears and squabbles for power, the worst of the bunch are rescued while two other boys die cruel deaths.<br /><br />Perhaps this book is made for children to appreciate their parents.  This would explain why I liked the book as a child.  Unfortunately, the innocence of children throwing spears at each other has left me.  Now I only wonder how much therapy these poor kids needed to get past this episode in their lives.  It is still a good book, but your level of enjoyment is dependent upon your perspective.  The child in me gave it five stars, while as an adult I give it three stars.  Average: 4 stars.	2005-06-01

And that's what it is: a bunch of young boys are stuck on an island, they start off somewhat organized, and then, one by one, turn savage.<br /><br />My best friend recommended it to me, saying the ending was amazing. Perhaps it is. It is a sudden let down from the tension. Yes, I agree, it is amazingly written, but it is also hopeless. What life is left for the boys? They'll need a lot of visits to the shrink, I expect.<br /><br />But that's not what it's about. We are not supposed to think of the long term, only be aware of the depravity of the human race. Anyway, that's what I got out of it. And I am glad I read it - if only to say that I read it and now sort of know what the fuss is all about.	2005-04-27

If you do not already own this book (presumably why your here) then you should buy it now. That's it. Right now.<br /><br />Still here?<br /><br />Ok. I suppose you probably want my reasons for reccomending this book, before just buying it on my word that it is good. The reasons are as follows:-<br /><br />1: Lord of the flies is original. And I mean actualy, properly  original. It does not try to compete against the high tech thrillers such as Jurrassic park, (also an amazing book by the way), or the fast pace thrills of the Da Vinci Code, (amazing again). It is not a horror book, or a romance, or a science fiction book. If I am forced into a situation where I have to classify this book, I call it a very, modern classic. It is one of those books that stays with you for the rest of your life. You will be able to remember every little plot twist for years to come.<br /><br />2: It is a beautifully crafted, highly relevant novel that acts as a window into the emotions of a child, as well as reflecting the behavior of the human race as a whole. In other words, it shows you what would actually happen if you dumped a load of kids onto an island in real life. There are no illogocal leaps here. Everything flows, everythiing works, everything is stunningly real. It is this that makes the book as terrifying, and as haunting as any I have ever read.<br /><br />3: It's good for all ages and all audiences. Well, all ages that can read. Basicaly it is fine for anyone who could read and understand Harry Potter. It is terrifying, but not in the way that induces nightmares. It has action in it, but it is not entirely based around car chases. It is not hugely fast paced, because you will be hooked enough to read it at a slow pace. It will make you think about/complain about/reflect on life.It is not a romance. But I would say that the character relationships in it are the most important part of the book. (In case you're wondering, this is not something I usualy say, and character relationships are not usually what drives me to buy a book. But in this case... just buy the book and see for yourself.)<br /><br />4: It has everything, all written in a style that not so much leaves you wanting more, as leaves you wanting to get other people to read the book, while you read it again. It has a good plot, characters, location, suspence, anything else you can think of.<br /><br />5: If you still don't want to buy it, buy it for a friend, (any friend, it doesn't matter, if they can read it they'll like it), and then take thier word for how good it is. They'll just get to read it before you do, thats all.<br /><br />So, this is one of my favourite books ever, number 1 is possible, and it won a nobel prize for literature. So now that you know my opinion go and buy the book.<br /><br />Bought it yet?ase you're wondering, this is not something I usualy say, and character relationships are not usually what drives me to buy a book.

This superbly written book has an extremely simple basis, which is human nature. William Golding illustrates human nature through words by telling the story of a group of schoolboys who crash land on a deserted island. At first the boys get along electing democratically a leader. The leader being Ralph who symbolizes everything good and righteous. Slowly however things on the island begin changing as human nature and a power hungry boy takes over.<br /><br /> The power hungry boy is named Jack who symbolizes evil and in my mind Nazi Germany. He slowly by force takes over Ralph, Piggy, and the rest of the weaker part of the group. This group could possibly symbolize the Jewish people in Nazi Germany. Jack and his band of strong classmates oppress and put down the weaker bunch continually. Slowly they become more and more physical until fights break out and two distinct groups are formed.<br /><br /> One group headed by Ralph was the weaker group and the other headed by Jack was the stronger group. Eventually, Simon a boy who was for peace and not dividing was \\"sacrificed\\" by Jack's group and total war broke out until Piggy had been killed and everyone else on Ralph's side fled to Jack's. Ralph alone and scared was hunted like an animal by Jack's band of hunters. The forest catches ablaze and Jack is on Ralph's heels with a spear in hand but what will happen next? You must read the book to find out!<br /><br /> This book is one of my personal favorites because of the immense amount of symbolism and hidden meanings. The characters can take on different groups in history and play out exactly what happened in those situations just like the one I provided about Nazi Germany. Another reason I adore this book is because of it's cold and raw reality about human nature and the scary fact that the school boys in the story could one day be anyone of us.	2005-04-17
US	52541763	R1OE5R9SAHVGYF	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	3	0	4	N	N	The Lord of the Flies	In the Lord of the Flies, William Golding reveals his pessimistic (and I would say accurate) view of human nature.  As everyone must know, the book depicts a group of schoolboys marooned on a tropical island, where in the absence of an overbearing state they soon fall into the \\"nasty, brutish, and short\\" existence predicted by Thomas Hobbes and many other political philosophers.<br /><br />This is a wonderful premise for a novel, but Golding's treatment of it is pedestrian and there is little here that is surprising or entertaining.  On the first page, we meet a fat boy with glasses.  He's obviously doomed.  On the fourth page, we read that another boy has \\"a mildness about his mouth and eyes that proclaimed no devil.\\"  So we know he's not going to be at the top of the food chain, either.  And so on.<br /><br />Admittedly, part of the problem may be that the book has been so widely read and discussed.  Supposing that this book may have more to offer someone who is not already familiar with its theme, I am giving it the benefit of the doubt and three stars.	2005-04-16

Yet this book is more then just a book of Crusoe survival.  In fact, this could be Golding's sociological view of youth when tested.  Of course, this is solely fiction.<br /><br />Either way though, this story of cohesion and division can touch one, but then it can also frighten.  Now whether that skill is attributed to the plot or Golding's writing is debatable, although it's probably both.<br /><br />Like I said though, this is a classic for all, espesically the middle-schooler.	2005-03-24

On the surface, this novel is a story of survival on a desert island, but it goes so much deeper. It delves into the duality of mankind, the evil within us all, and the power of savagery when the restraints of civilization are no longer present. The main character is Ralph, a British schoolboy, who finds himself on a desert island with his new friend, Piggy, and other boys who survived a plane crash on the island. Each character is a symbol and the \\"loss of innocence\\" genre novel follows the boys' lives on the island and chronicles their descent into savagery. Ralph sees the importance of order which is relevant through his demand for smoke in order to be rescued, and his blowing of the conch, a symbol for civilization. Jack and Roger both represent evil and savagery, while Piggy represents clear-sightedness and intelligence. Simon, the archetypal \\"Christ figure,\\" is the visionary who never gets to explain the TRUE beast to the group of boys.  If you want a cute story about life on the island of Paradise, an easy to read, surface level novel- don't read Lord of the Flies. If you truly understand the underlying meanings, you will be appalled with the darkness of man and you'll see the degree of evil that lack of civilization uncovers by the end of the book. Overall, an amazing piece of literature!!!! FIVE STARS! Thanks to Mr. Vasile for the opportunity to read it.	2005-03-20

He uses third-person omniscient. The narrator speaks<br /><br />in the third-person, primarily focusing on Rrallph's point of view but following<br /><br />Jack and Simon in certain episodes. The narrator is erudite and gives us<br /><br />aceess to the characters inside character's thoughts. Author's uses short,<br /><br />simple and grammatical sentence structure. He uses interesting vocabulary, but<br /><br />not a large vocabulary.<br /><br />  Golding express Civilization vs. Savagery, the instinct to live by rules, act<br /><br /> peacefully, follow moral commands, and value the good of the group against<br /><br />the instinct to gratify one's immediate desires, act violently to obtain supremacy<br /><br />over others, and enforce one's will. And Loss of Innocence As the boys on the<br /><br />island progress from well-behaved, orderly children longing for rescue to cruel,<br /><br />bloodthirsty hunters. They lose the sense of innocence that they possessed at<br /><br />the beginning of the novel. In the camping out or collective there are exactly<br /><br />have a leader.

The book takes place on a deserted island out in the middle of nowhere after a plane carrying some young boys crashes into the sea and the survivors are forced to take refuge on the island. After many days of frightening events dealing with being alone on the island, one boy named Jack, turns into a savage and persuades the rest of the group to leave Ralph, who is the one in charge, to join his wild ways. Many horrible events take place that embed disturbing images in your head throughout the story. It is a unique way for teaching the readers exactly how brutal and harsh being stranded alone on an island with no special form of government or order of any kind could be. The story portrays many real-life aspects about the struggles for power and leadership that the boys go through on the island. It greatly outlines the conflicts between two boys, Ralph and Jack, who are constantly competing for total control over the group. With no grown-ups around, the boys are forced to deal with the harsh reality by themselves. This experience in itself will change the lives of the boys forever.<br /><br /> This book is a great reading experience for aspiring readers who are into adventure novels. The Lord of the Flies gives off a dark and mysterious tale that is greatly expressed in detail. The emotions and actions of these boys were greatly presented in the writing in order to give full aspect of what is happening. Overall, we would recommend reading this novel because it is a wonderfully original story that takes your mind into a totally different world of thought. Also, if you are interested in dark, disturbing stories, this book would be an excellent choice because you never know what bizarre events are going to happen to them next.	2005-03-09

On the outside, its a novel about a group of english boys who have crash landed on a island that is void of any adult contact. But on the inside, its a deep look into society and human nature. After some time on the island Simon,one of the english boys, meets the LOTF. The LOTF tells Simon that he is in him and all others on the island. Refenceing from the Epiloge p.205, the LOTF translated means Devil or Satan. In my opinion, based on this book, all human beings are naturally evil and that we are driven by self-intrest. I liked this book and think you will too.	2005-03-07

But what it is good at is opening a eye to what our society is really like. Lord of the Flies is about about 20 or so english kids who crash land on a deserted island that know ones knows about. The actual LOTF means Devil or Satan if translated. The Devil in this book sads for the boys evil in killing a pig and putting its head on the stake so the \\"beast\\" won't kill them. It goes on for a while and then the boys split up and become savages killing 2 kids. This book represents all the flaws in society and how all men (and women) are truly evil at heart.

What happens is a group of young british schoolboys crashland on an uncharted island. We don't know where they were going and what they were going to do when they get there, but I think they were being sent to a bording school where a war that was going on couldn't reach them. The whole theme of the story is about why these boys degraded to total savages, and why they were no longer caring about the modern civilized world when they did become savages. As all of this goes along, there are many symbolic things in the story itself, like one of unity, of rationalism, or of intelligence. So as the story goes along, these symbols either become unimportant or are raised in importance. Golding did this to show us examples of what happens when we lose these symbols.	2005-03-05

The book takes you through the journey of these boys. They have to deal with the fear of the beast in the dark forest, the fear of each other, and the fear of no escape. The book shows how normal boys can turn into savages and turn against each other. The two main characters, Jack and Ralph, start off friendly but as the story developes tension rises, and things take a turn fot the worst. In the novel, William Golding uses suspense and mystery to keep the reader interested. I would recomend this book to everyone. Golding's descriptive novel will keep you interested from start to finish. It will also keep you in suspense about whether ot not the boys will get off the island.	2005-03-05

When I read a book, if it doesn't move me like The Lord of the Flies, I hesitate to give more than 4 stars. However, after reading Golding's novel, I rushed to award top marks. An airplane full of English schoolboys has crash-landed on a deserted island. As their condition detiorates, loyalties and protocols begin to crumble and the animalistic side of human nature emerges within the group. As I stated in the title of this review, the writing is authentic. You won't find the string of cliches like you see with other authors. The story is beautiful and terrifying at the same time. One wishes for 200 more pages as the story climaxes with page-turning exitement.  Golding's use of symbolism is genius. This book is on my \\"must reads of a lifetime\\" list. Put it on yours.	2005-02-23

The story is about a group of British schoolboys who are, after a plane-crash, left on their own in a lonely tropical island. The story is basically an allegory; and Golding does his work marvellously. The gripping story has a clear, straight-forward narrative, and is certainly one of those books I wouldn't mind re-reading, over and over again.	2005-02-18

At first the overview that my teacher gave me, it sounded like it was a real interesting book, however once I got reading the book, I found that it was at all as interesting as it had sounded.<br /><br />Here is a little overview of the book; a group of British schoolboys survive a plane crash and end up on a desert island with no adults to watch over them.  They soon create rules about how to run the group and who should be leader.  They divide tasks among themselves and even use a conch shell to determine who has the right to speak to the group at large gatherings. They soon create their own society based on the values they have been taught.  They manage to collect enough food and even to keep a fire going in the hope of being able to attract attention from would-be rescuers. Later on in the book, the order in their society starts to break down, as their situation becomes more desperate and as alliances between different subgroups start to build. The group begins to turn on each other; a war begins between two divided groups with two completely different leaders. Some boys begin to kill off the other boys in the divided groups. The officer's ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed at the spectacle of this group of bloodthirsty, savage children, the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well. The officer turns his back so that the boys may regain their composure.<br /><br />The main characters of the book are,<br /><br />Ralph - The novel's protagonist<br /><br />Jack - The novel's antagonist<br /><br />Simon<br /><br />Piggy<br /><br />Roger<br /><br />Sam and Eric<br /><br />The Lord of the Flies<br /><br /> I really did not like this book, when I was reading it; it seemed to be drawn out. Everything just to long to explain. At first it sounded like an interesting book, however when I got into reading it was not at all. It is just one of those books that I can not read with out falling asleep. It just didn't catch my attention form the beginning. There was nothing that interested me in the book at all. I found in many parts of the story, wondering what I had just read, I would have to reread that section over again, before I could understand what had happened. There were many sections of the book that I found myself confused. The scene of the book jumped from place to place making it hard to follow. Overall I just did not like the book at all, it just did not answer me from the beginning.ot like this book, when I was reading it; it seemed to be drawn out. Everything just to long to explain.

I thought it was a very good book. The author did a good job of making you feel like you were actually there with characters. I don't really like to read but with this book I was able to get into it and finish the book.<br /><br /> The novel the Lord Of the Flies was about a bunch of kids that are flying across an island during a war. Then the plane had been shot down. The kids end up landing on an abandoned island. As they hit the island they all get separated. Then a little bit in to the book they had all found each other and they decided to make a type of government to keep control on the island. Now as they go on in the book  you got to think that they are all kids and they don't want to live under other  kids rule. So as the story goes on they all start to turn on each other and start making their own organizations. As the book starts to develop there are a lot of different symbols that you start to realize. The symbols represent a bunch of different things the book and how some of the characters act. Then the book starts to get a little violent as they start to kill each other. Towards the end  of the book they have completely all gone wild and turned against each other.<br /><br /> I thought that the book was very good. I liked the whole idea of the book. I think that it is a good book and I recommend it to anyone that likes to read. It was a short and easy to read. I liked how the author had described the book in detail. that's what made it  a book good. The book had a good theme and I liked how they had kids trying to start their own type of  government to maintain control. It was a good idea because you really don't know what kids would do if their were no parents around.	2005-01-21

It shows that with to much power people go crazy and do things so out of the ordinary.  I enjoyed the book.  Being a person who does not like to read, and is very picky about the books that I do read, this was a very good one.<br /><br />Due to the violence of a raging war, an airplane carrying a groups of English students is shot down.  The boys of the plane find themselves to be stranded on an island.  After they gather all of the boys on the island they start to make plans.  Two of the oldest boys Ralph and Piggy find a conch shell, they decided to use it in order to summon the rest of the group.  They Ralph as their leader, Ralph appoints another older boy Jack to be in charge of the choirboys who are in charge of hunting and getting food.<br /><br /> The older boys set out and explore the island.  They decide that they will light large torches to get the attention of passing ships.  They gather wood easily, there is more than enough wood to have several fires.  They use the glasses of piggy to focus the sunlight onto the wood and create fire.  The problem is the boys were more focused on playing rather than monitoring the fire.  The fire quickly gets out of control and burns a bunch of dead wood.  The youngest of the boys disappears and they presume that he burned to death in the fire.  The boys are very immature.  They enjoy the loss of no adults and spend most of their time splashing and playing in the water.  Ralph complains that nothing is getting done. They also fail in catching a pig, Jack the leader becomes more intent on catching a pig.<br /><br /> An approaching ship passes by, but does not realize anyone is on the island because the rescue fire was out.  Ralph rushes to the fire immediately only to find that Jack and the rest of the hunter's have caught their first pig.  They gather around a fire and reenact the hunt.  Ralph quickly blows the conch shell to call a meeting to restore order.  At one of the meeting one of the \\"littluns\\" tells that he is haunted by the thought of a monster on the island.  The older boys gather and tell each other to think logically and figure out where this monster would hide during the daytime. They come to some conclusion that he might live in the water.<br /><br /> The boys that are responsible for watching the fire at night think they see a shadow of the beast, when they actually just saw the shadow of a dead parachutist, they rush back to the camp and tell everyone that they saw the beast.  They organize a hunting party and go up the mountain, they see the shadow of the parachutist and run down the mountain.  Jack criticizes Ralph of being a coward and says that he should be removed from power.  The boys agree that they will never vote Ralph out of power.  Jack runs down to the beach and tells all the hunter's to follow him.  Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe.  Simon falls upon the dead parachutist, and runs back to the beach to tell everyone.  Before he can open his mouth he is trample and beaten to death.  The boys saw the shadow of Simon and thought it was the beast and killed him.<br /><br /> The next morning Jack's tribe of hunters attacks Ralph and Piggy.  They steal Piggy's glasses and run back to their camp.  Ralph and the boys from his tribe go to Jack's camp to try to reason with Jack.  Jack order's that Sam and Eric be tied up, and one boy rolls a boulder down the mountain killing Piggy and shattering the conch shell.  Ralph hides for the night, but in the morning Jack sends out a search party looking for him.  As his hunters try to track him down, Jack sets a forest fire trying to smoke Ralph out of his hiding spot.  Ralph is forced to the beach, and collapses in exhaustion.

Furious, Ralph accosts Jack, but the hunter has just returned with his first kill. Piggy criticizes Jack, who hits Piggy across the face. Ralph blows the conch shell and scolds the boys in a speech intended to restore order. At the meeting, it quickly becomes clear that some of the boys have started to become afraid. The littlest boys, known as the littluns have had nightmares from, the beginning, and more and more boys now believe that there is some sort of beast or monster on the island. The older boys try to convince the others at the meeting to think rationally, asking where such a monster could possibly hide during the daytime. One of the littluns suggests that it hides in the sea.  Not long after the meeting, some military planes battle high above the island. The boys, asleep below, do not notice the flashing lights and explosions in the clouds. A parachutist drifts down on the mountain.  Sam and Eric are responsible for watching the fire at night, they are asleep and do not see the parachutist land. When the twins wake up, they see the enormous shadow of his parachute and hear the strange flapping noises it makes. Thinking the island beast is at hand, they rush back to the camp in terror. Jack and Ralph, travel up the mountain.. The group holds a meeting at which Jack and Ralph tell the others of the sighting. Jack says that Ralph is a coward and that he should be removed from office, but the other boys refuse to vote Ralph out of power. Jack angrily runs away down the beach, calling all the hunters to join him. Ralph rallies the remaining boys to build a new signal fire, this time on the beach rather than on the mountain. They obey, but before they have finished, most of them have slipped away to join Jack.<br /><br />Jack declares himself the leader of the new tribe of hunters and organizes a hunt of a pig a violent, slaughter followed by sowing the head to a stick as a offering to the beast. Later, encountering the bloody, fly-covered head, Simon has a terrible vision, during which it seems to him that the head is speaking. The voice, says that Simon will never escape him, for he exists within all men. Simon faints. When he wakes up, he goes to the mountain, where he sees the dead parachutist. Understanding then that the beast does not exist.  Simon travels to the beach to tell the others what he has seen. But the others are in the middle of a chaotic revelry when they see Simon's shadowy figure emerge from the jungle, they fall upon him and kill him with their bare hands and teeth.<br /><br />Ralph hides for the rest of the night and the following day, while the others hunt him like an animal.. Ralph collapses in exhaustion after being chased out of the forest, but when he looks up, he sees a British naval officer standing over him. The officer's ship noticed the fire raging in the jungle. The other boys reach the beach and stop in their tracks at the sight of the officer. Amazed atthe spectacle of this group the officer asks Ralph to explain. Ralph is overwhelmed by the knowledge that he is safe but, thinking about what has happened on the island, he begins to weep. The other boys begin to sob as well.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book it was very interesting and had a lot of action in it.  I liked how the ending began with the plane going down and the boys being stranded on the island.  Another favorite part of the book was towards the end when all the boys break up and they are fighting.  Overall this was a good book to read and I would recommend it to anyone.mazed at the spectacle of this group the officer asks Ralph to explain.

A boy by the name of Ralph is chosen to be their leader and he appoints Jack to be the leader of the hunters.  Throughout the book the boys attempt ways to be found, many of them not working.  There are basically four main characters in this novel, Ralph, Jack, Simon and Piggy.  All of them have unique traits which lead to conflicts throughout the novel.<br /><br />A twelve year old boy by the name of Ralph is the chosen leader of the civilization.  Throughout the book Ralph has to fend off the other boys attempt at his power.  Jack, elected leader of the hunters by Ralph is the opposite of Ralph.  Jack is a savage like boy that wants total power and will do whatever it takes to be at the top.  Simon is said as the only naturally \\"good\\" character on the island.  He is nice to all the younger boys on the island.  Piggy is Ralph's \\"lieutenant\\" who is an innovative inventive child.  His intelligence leads to the development of the Sundial, which the boys use to tell time.  They are all given things to do in order to be found, some more challenging than others.<br /><br />The first thing Ralph wants the children of the island to do is start a signal fire.  They use Piggy's eyeglasses to start the fire, but the fire quickly ignites the forest.  When Ralph realizes that the Signal Fire is out he is upset at Jack.  When Jack gets back from hunting he has caught something for the first time and Ralph's fury gets lost in the mix.  Throughout the novel a conch shell serves as a symbol of power.  Whoever has the conch shell controls everything; the kids, the island and most importantly the civilization.  As the adventure goes on the little boys or the \\"littluns\\" are becoming terrified of being on the island.<br /><br />Later on in the novel the hunters go into the mountains of the island to look for monsters.  The littluns are having nightmares about there being monsters on the island.  From a distance the hunters see what they think is an ape hanging from a tree.  It is really a parachutist that was killed hanging in a tree.  A character by the name of Roger is beginning to become a factor at this point in the story.  Roger is Jack's \\"lieutenant\\" and is just like Jack.  Cruel and a savage type of boy.  Sides between the groups of children are being formed.  Jack's hunters versus Ralph's people.

Golding skillfully plays envy, rage, and fear off of one another both between and within the characters.  The sense that none of the strife is warranted or deserved is set against the larger context of war at the end of the story.  The reader is then left to cross the conceptual bridge between the micro and macro, and I suspect that many do not without the aid of a post-read analysis or critique.<br /><br />Peter Gamache, MBA, MLA, MPH	2005-01-11

In this chapter Jack leaves and the boys split into two camps; Jack and his hunters become increasingly savage; and we finally understand the true nature of the Beast as well as understanding Simon's role in the novel.<br /><br />The chapter begins with every boy on the island finally accepting the existence of a Beast; even Ralph, who was once so sceptical (\\"But there isn't a beastie!\\") believes there is one and convinces Piggy, who also used to be a cynic.<br /><br />Jack calls a meeting amid the growing tensions between himself and Ralph. We also recognise Ralph's growing maturity in the face of Jack's childishness. Jack's language is childish: \\"He isn't a prefect\\". Jack confronts everyone at the last meeting all the boys have together, and criticizes Ralph: ' \\"He just gives orders and expects people to obey.\\" ' At the end he challenges them as to whether they think Ralph ought to be Chief, and is humiliated when none of the boys agree with him: 'The humiliating tears were running from the corner of each eye'. He 'blundered' away and 'dived' into the forest.<br /><br />Simon then makes a suggestion: that they should climb the mountain, where the Beast is, because there seems nothing else to do. Simon is viewed as being 'crackers' by the rest of the group and is not taken seriously, especially by Piggy, in who he had at first trusted. Piggy changes here from being a shy and socially incompetent but intelligent boy, into someone gaining confidence by Jack's absence, but also by scoring points off others.<br /><br />An ominous mood is then set after the choirboys vanish, to go off with Jack. Jack imposes himself as leader and the choirboys accept it: ' \\"I'm going to be chief.\\" They nodded'. This leadership is enforced later in the chapter when Maurice and Robert announce that \\"The Chief has spoken\\" when Jack encourages others to join him after stealing some fire. However, they are reluctant to make this announcement; maybe they still feel that Ralph is the real leader and Jack in the wrong.<br /><br />We are reminded of how much the boys have changed: 'ages ago they had stood in two demure rows and their voices had been the song of angels'. Now they are hunters, dirty and uncivilized, about to kill a pig. We also realise that, for all their tough talk, they are scared of the Beast as well: ' \\"We shan't dream so much down here. This is near the end of the island.\\" They agreed passionately out of the depths of their tormented private lives.' The island also has a psychological landscape: at the end of the island, they are near the 'castle' rock.<br /><br />Kill is ritually left for the Beast, a chilling reminder of their progression towards primitive savagery. The pig's head on the stick represents a manifestation of the Devil; therefore it is significant that Jack and Roger are the boys who put the pig's head on the stick.<br /><br />Roger 'sharpens a stick at both ends' on which to put the pig's head. He sharpens a stick at both ends again when hunting down Ralph at the end of the novel. Roger features more in this chapter and becomes more important throughout the book; in the end he kills Piggy. In this chapter he is the most bloodthirsty of the boys: 'Roger found a lodgement for his point and began to push until he was leaning with his whole weight.'<br /><br />Ralph and Piggy call a meeting; during this, the idea of rescue becomes even fainter. Ralph's hair which falls over his eyes becomes a 'shutter'. Long hair is uncivilized; as Ralph's hair becomes longer so he can't see, the idea of rescue gets fainter as Ralph becomes less civilized.<br /><br />As the novel' title shows, this is the central chapter. Simon is a saintly character; a prophet who sees things. During one of his 'times' (faints, which prophets are meant to have) he sees a pig's head on a stick come alive and turn into the Lord of the Flies, a manifestation of the Devil, hence the 'ancient,inescapable recognition'. Through Simon's confrontations with the Lord of the Flies we come to understand the true nature of the Beast- it is the Lord of the Flies (\\"And I'm the Beast\\") but it is also psychological: \\"I'm part of you? Close, close, close! I'm the reason why it's no go?\\" However, Simon is not allowed to tell the others about his discovery \\"We'll forget the whole thing\\" and is threatened \\"You're not wanted. We are going to have fun on this island!\\" (see pages 45 and 95) and is warned that if he tells the others, and stops them having fun, \\"we shall do you\\". Simon does try to tell the others and is killed; the prophecy comes true.<br /><br />Since it is in his imagination that the Lord of the Flies warns him that he will die if he tells, and the Lord of the Flies is part of him, in effect, like Jesus, he predicts his own death.<br /><br />I had to study this book for school, and unlike other school books, I did not find myself hating it after a couple of days. I'd read it before, but thought no more of it than a sinister boys' adventure story. Studying it (I think it's one of the few books meant to be read into) really made me take an interest and now it's in my top 5 along with \\"Discworld\\", \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\", \\"The Day of the Jackal\\" and \\"empire of the Sun\\".hence the 'ancient, inescapable recognition'.

The book is about how a group of children got deserted on an untrodden island and how they try to survive and get rescued. Children probably would not like the horror, but the book is suitable for teens and adults. Golding used many devices including symbolism and he also didn't finish the book completely, which let the readers choose what will happen to the boys. He ended the book with a guard finding Ralph and a few little ones while Jack and his crew was still missing. I didn't like the end of the book or the symbolism because I don't adjust well with these aspects.<br /><br />Even though it was a fantastic book, I thought some of the scenes were disgusting. For instance, some of the descriptions of the pig, Simon, and Piggy's deaths were gruesome. Golding used descriptive words to make you imagine what was going on. When those events were about to happen, Golding used foreshadowing. The story is so unpredictable and suspenseful that readers are on the edge of their seat. Golding wrote amazingly with not many boring and slow parts. However, there are a few confusing parts in the story that are complicated to understand. Overall, Golding did a great job rewriting the story with a different twist from the book that started it all - Coral Island. In fact, this is one of the best novels that I ever read. I would rate this book 4 out of 5.	2004-12-17

It's a captivating story, with an intruiging plot that holds your attention throughout the story. It's about a group of British kids that are trapped on an island after their plane crashes. All the kids come together as a group and decide that Ralph should be the leader of the island.  Ralph, with the help of his friend Piggy, decides that the island needs to have rules and regualtions. Jack Merridew is mad that he isn't voted as chief and at first is ok with it, but as the story continues he turns against Ralph. Jack is a hunter and starts a society of hunters on the other side of the island. I am not going to say much more but the plot is very intense and violent with many examples of hatred, and also death. It shows two very different views of how people can change when put in certain situations. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure, and I also recommend this book because it captures your attention and holds it until the very end.	2004-12-16

But instead  of this a narrow ledge of rock, a few yards wide and perhaps fifteen long, continued the island out  into the sea. There lay another of those pieces of pink squareness that underlay the structure of the island. This side of the castle, perhaps a hundred feet high, was the pink bastion they had seen from the mountain-top.

The plot of the book one can simplify into a seven or eight page summary, but the rest is too painful to read.

I felt there were quite a few changes the author could have made to the story. There was a lot of symbolism and many British terms I didn't understand, making the book a little confusing at times. I also disagree with how Golding killed off the littlun with the birthmark, Simon, and Piggy. I thought there was just something wrong about killing off three young children in such a violent manner but I also think it was needed to make a very strong point about how you may think that you know a person but on the inside they could be someone totally different.<br /><br />  There were some good aspects of the book. I liked the way the author described the environment the boys were in. It was very thorough and it gives you a good understanding of the conditions they are living in and a good mental image with out going into too much detail. I also thought it was interesting how Golding divided the boys into two separate societies. I felt it demonstrated the two sides of society very well. It shows that on the surface society seems organized and well-governed but sometimes underneath it all people can be savage, cruel, and sadistic to one another.<br /><br />Overall I felt that this book was well written and unlike most books I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading and understands symbolism.	2004-10-28

These two boys names are Ralph and Jack. They have an election and Ralph wins and is elected chief. He appoints Jack to the hunters ( him and his choir). These two argue about everything whether to gather food, make shelter, or hunt pigs. The one who is always on Ralph's side is Piggy and the one who is always on Jack's side is Roger. The one who is in the middle is Simon he is the one who is on neither side. Another thing is they are always worried about some beastie and the only two who knows there is no beastie is Simon and Piggy. About midway through the book Jack decides he is not going to play anymore and takes him and his savages off to start a new government. This new government ends up killing a pig and having a feast they invite all the good people (Ralph, Piggy, Sam, and Eric) to join them. They end going and they have a little savage dance after they eat. Simon isn't there because he has just found out that the man in the parachute who they think is the beastie is actually just a dead man. When Simon comes down the mountain trying to show them there is no beastie they turn on him and think he is the beast because they are so wrapped up in this savage dance. They end up killing Simon but now most of them are not worried about the beastie because they think that they killed the beastie. Later on the savages raid the other camp for Piggy's glasses so they can have a fire. Ralph's tribe goes to the other tribe to try and get the glasses back and Roger kills Piggy with a huge boulder. After Piggy is killed the savages catch Sam, Eric, and Ralph and tie them up and torture them Sam and Eric give up and join the savages while Ralph escapes. Jack wants Ralph so bad that they decide to go form eats to west all the way across the island they start to walk and Roger finds him Ralph kills Roger and starts running then he hides again and is almost no found until he screams then he takes off running he runs into and officer and the officer thinks they are playing a game then they get rescued and that is where the book ends.

The only question that needs to be answered is whether it was in their nature to be evil, or were they raised in a bad environment and society made them that way?  This question is answered in the classic tale Lord of the Flies by William Golding.<br /><br />  William Golding joined the Royal Navy when World War II broke out.  For five years he was involved in naval matters finishing his naval career as a lieutenant in command of a rocket ship.  He had seen action against battleships, submarines and aircraft, and had participated in the Walcheren and D-Day operations.  Today he is famous for his novel Lord of the Flies and its many references to human nature.<br /><br />  During World War II in an attempt to get away from the war a group of English schoolboys are plane wrecked on a deserted island only to find that there is no escape of war.  They don't mean for this to happen, they first try to cooperate, attempting to gather food, make shelters, and maintain fire signals to be rescued.  They even elect a leader, Ralph, to oversee everything, who has an intelligent sidekick to help guide him to do the right things.  But like all societies, this one has its rebels who would rather swim, play, and hunt the island's wild pigs.  Soon Ralph's rules are being ignored and challenged by his rival, Jack.  Jack starts his own tribe of wild painted savages and as more boys join his band, any civilization deteriorates until some boys are even being hunted.<br /><br />  \\"Ralph saw it first, and watched till the intentness of his gaze drew all eyes that way.  Then the creature stepped from mirage on to clear sand, and they saw that the darkness was not all shadow but mostly clothing.  The creature was a party of boys, marching approximately in step in two parallel lines and dressed in strangely eccentric clothing.\\"  Not only is the language extremely descriptive, but this passage, found in the first chapter of the book, already foreshadows the beast on the island.  The group of boys end up being Jack and his choir group, which from the beginning is portrayed as a creature, or beast for that is what they become.<br /><br />  Golding's book is continuously foreshadowing what will happen, and it is only when you look closely that you see exactly how inevitable it was that Jack and his choir would be the \\"evil\\" tribe.  \\"Roger led the way straight through the castles, kicking them over, burying the flowers, scattering the chosen stones.  Maurice followed, laughing, and added to the destruction... Only Percival began to whimper with an eyeful of sand and Maurice hurried away.\\"  Maurice and Roger, part of Jack's group, are already testing their limits on how far they can go without getting in trouble.  There are no adults on the island, no one to stop them from harming each other and they slowly start realizing that, and get worse and worse in their treatment of each other so they don't even feel guilty for anything they have done.<br /><br />  One of the most enjoyable aspects of this book is the characters.  You know them, they may even have characteristics that you recognize as your own.  Ralph, marked out from the beginning by his \\"size, and attractive appearance\\" is most likely one of those kids in school who get everything they want because of their looks.  A born leader who isn't necessarily the smartest, but strives to do the right thing, but doesn't always know what that is.  He has to constantly be reminded of his confidante, Piggy.  Piggy is constantly picked on, and called \\"Fatty\\" or \\"Piggy.\\"  We don't even know his real name, but he is known by the sad, pathetic nickname he told everyone in the beginning.  Never taken seriously, he would be known as the sad outsider who didn't have many friends, intelligent, and a bookworm.  If he was listened to, maybe they would have fared better, but we will never know since everyone is judged on appearance in this book.  Finally, there is Jack, a true bully, commanding and teasing so everyone knows who the true leader is.<br /><br /> Because we can relate, we can even understand why certain things happen because we are familiar with the teasing, and bullying that takes place.  It helps us understand what happens to these boys, and become even more aware that it is happening right now.  It is happening in school, the workplace, against other races, Iraq, and this book is to show us just how bad it is.  Human nature, are we naturally evil, or is it society that makes us the way we are.  According to Lord of the Flies it is the way we are born, but it is up to you to decide.he would be known as the sad outsider who didn't have many friends, intelligent, and a bookworm.

It is about the obstacles that the boys overcome on this island without adults, and how their different characters and ideas clash. The main characters are Ralph, Jack and Piggy. Ralph is the appointed leader who is constantly challenged by Jack who believes he is important because he was the choir leader at school. Piggy is unaccepted by everyone except Ralph who sees Piggy's intelligence. This book is about how a group of boys behave with no adults and no rules.<br /><br />  A significant moment in this book is in the first chapter when Ralph blows the conch shell and all of the boys come to him. This moment shows the power of the conch shell and the power it gives to someone who blows it. This is important because power and power struggles are definitely apparent in this book.<br /><br />  I would recommend Lord of the Flies to people who enjoy books about children trying to survive without any adults. Also people who like to read books which show some of the extremes humans can go when there is no one in control. I would suggest people who don't like graphic descriptions of violence not to read some scenes in this book. I personally found the book to be a bit of a slow read, and sometimes the descriptions got really long, thus making the book rather boring.<br /><br />  I feel that the author, William Golding, of Lord of the Flies is a good author. Because he uses so much description of the boys, the island, and of the boys' actions it is very easy to visualize what is happening. Also he writes in such a way that it makes the book seem real, like this really happened. Lord of the Flies is a very well written book. For me the mark of a good writer is making it possible for me, the reader, to connect to the book, and characters. So I feel that Lord of the Flies is very well written.	2004-10-23

They form a society with Ralph, one of the boys, as their group leader. While on the island, they want to be rescued, but until then, they hunt pig and hold assemblies.  The story is about the struggle to keep order on the island.<br /><br />  A significant event in the story is when Piggy and Ralph find a conch shell in the water. It allowed order to start on the island. This was because people were able to talk when they held the conch. It was also used to call assemblies.<br /><br />  We think that the author is a good writer. His discriptions are very detailed. That allowed us to keep interest in the story. The author seems to be a credible source of what he has written, because he was in WWII, which was the time in which the book took place.<br /><br />  We would definitely reccommend this book because it is different from most books we have previously read. It takes the reader back to the time when children always dreamed of having no adults around to tell them what to do. We also always kept reading because we wanted to know what would happen next. It is an excellent book.	2004-10-21

The novel is about some boys stranded in an island and becoming savages. When I finished the novel I couldn't stop thinking about it. I kept on thinking of how some of the boys survived. They had what they needed to survive, a signal, hunters for food, and shelters. They had no adults around to take care of them. Some of them were trying really hard to get allong and follow the rules that they had made for themselfs. But in a story there is always someone who doesn't like to go with the rules. Later on the boys become savages and fight against each other. This novel made me understand how important it is to have an adult around and what their knowledge can bring. I really enjoyed this novel and I know that anyone can enjoy it too.	2004-10-16

I felt that the book was a little too predictable.  I was surprised that this was Golding's response to the evils he saw in WWII as a member of the Royal Navy, because I figured it would be more graphic or have been about the war, rather than the story of a group of English schoolboys whose plane is shot down on an island.  At the beginning of the book when Ralph calls all the boys who survived the plane crash with the conch and they voted him leader over Jack, I could tell that the conflict of the story would be between these characters.  I did not feel like Golding was able to get across his theme of the inner evil of mankind because of his character choice of a group of young boys.  From personal experience I can tell you that almost all young boys are mischievous and have an evil side to them, but I don't feel that they are an accurate representation of all humans.  However, I do feel that Golding used a lot of great symbolism in this novel with the use of Piggy's glasses as being able to see things for what they really are, and the use of the conch to represent power and order.  Another interesting thing is Beelzebub, one of the fallen angels in Milton's Paradise Lost, translates to Lord of the Flies. For the theme of evil Golding was trying to use, this was a great title.	2004-10-03
US	16403463	R2MKPFKQGNCAHI	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	3	1	2	N	N	parallel to civilization	William Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies\\", is about a group of young children, stranded on an uninhabited island, who are forced to create their own civilization and survive.  The novel, while somewhat predictable and easy to understand, is filled with many important uses of symbolism.  In the opening, Piggy finds a conch shell, and uses it to bring order to the group, and the conch shell continues to symbolize order throughout the novel.  However, when Piggy is killed later on in the novel, the conch shell is destroyed also, symbolizing the end of order.  The 'Lord of the Flies', a severed pig's head, symbolizes the cruelty and brutality that the members of Jack's group possess.  Throughout the novel, there are many parallels that are made between the boy's civilization on the island, and civilization as a whole.  This novel is easy to read right through and not fully understand its entire purpose, but I believe William Golding's purpose for this novel is to provide an understanding of the evils of civilization and government.	2004-10-03

I enjoyed every minute of the text, and enjoyed analyzing it even more. With highlighter and marking pen in hand i went page by page and discovered the true depth of William Golding's writing in the tale of a band of young and adolescent boys whose plane crashes onto an uncharted island, and in the absence of adults they create their own world complete with government, conflict, and even bloodshed. In this ultimately dark novel, one witnesses Golding's unparalleled talent in storytelling as a means of intelligent propaganda, the story itself being a microcosm of the world war that was going on at the time. It's a fascinating read, whether you choose to read it for its deepest meaning or its most simple.<br /><br />I highly reccommend reading this book.

However, I think it is necessary to point out that neither of the 'bands' of boys can judged: they simply adapted.<br /><br />Perhaps what makes the reader uncomfortable is the fact that, in the end, there simply is no tendency towards order, discipline or any other such cherished of our values. If left to ourselves, we have the tendency to self-destruction.<br /><br />Seen as a system, the boys were all adapting, to the place and to themselves at the same time. This implied redefining most of the values they previously had.<br /><br />The end is deeply sad because the one boy representing our precious modern values is the one chased and marginated.<br /><br />It is fascinating how Golding can tell us a story through the eyes of a bunch of boys, and at the same time be very precise and barely crude about the very subtle changes which they all had to suffer to be able to adapt.<br /><br />This book remainds me a lot of the movie Das Experiment. In the beginning, you have 20 healthy guys just brought from the street, fresh, with the same values and the same attitude. They all were called to simulate a prison, so one half (the 'healthier' half) plays the part of the guards, and the other half become the inmates. Then the forces start to act on each group, and each group begins to change in order to adapt, in order to 'stabilize' the system, according to their own perspective. In the end, they all change, and definitely not for the best. The game is death serious towards the end.<br /><br />It is a sad conclusion. But it is also remarkable the order and relative stability we have accomplished in our society, with our institutions and values; it is a strange and very fragile balance between the rules and values we have created, and the very things which we are instinctively compelled to do.ely compelled to do.	2004-08-12

He uses outstanding dialect and language to portray the plight of a group of boys stranded on an island.  However, the symbolic nature of this book transcends nearly everything else I've ever written.  I orinally read this as a twelve year old not realizing what I was getting into.  I recently re-read it as a twenty-eight year old, and its relevance to world events even today is astounding.<br /><br />This is a loose transition from Orwell's Animal farm, where the good guys become the bad guys in the end.  It seems ironic how, at first, the boys cooperate because of their need and desire for structure and discipline.  However, as the story unwinds, we find some of the boys wanting freedom.  It is a freedom for which they have to fight, too.  However, in the undertaking of that freedom, they end up becoming the oppressors.<br /><br />This is a brilliant story with few, if any, flaws.  It is the history of the world in a nutshell.  All we need to know about history is in this short book.  It's too bad so very few understand it.	2004-08-07

The Nazis were gone, but still in modern memory. Russia's totalitarian state was a constant threat. McCarthyism hovered over everyone's privacy, as did J. Edgar Hoover. And recent fiction, like Aldous Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD and, especially, George Orwell's 1984 presented world views where the human spirit is all but squelched by governments and technologies.<br />LORD OF THE FLIES, in its own way, says, \\"Hold on a second! Humans do need to be regulated. And they do need to protect themselves from each other.\\" His tale is a warning: Humanity, without government, will degenerate into savagery and anarchy. And that is precisely what happens in this book. You know the plot, by now. But what has to be mentioned is that William Golding is a visionary who has the story-telling mastery to convey and do justice to that vision. LORD OF THE FLIES is a remarkable and powerful book, one that should be on everyone's bookshelf.	2004-07-19

On the surface, this is a simplistic story and a rather short one at 200 pages.  What is brilliant about this book, however, is Golding's ability to craft a powerful and timeless statement about humanity and mankind.  His prose is concise and focused, yet his ability to paint a picture of castaway life on a tropical island is every bit as good as much longer tomes.  I found the breakdown of civilized values played out on a beautiful tropical island to be a terrific dichotomy.  The interplay between the English school boys and the brutal reality of survival on an island provided numerous intersections in a brilliantly interwoven plot.  The end result is a rather haunting reminiscence of this story after you've finished reading it.  This is similar to Robinson Crusoe or The Count of Monte Cristo in that they are all stories we know.  Yet, going back and reading them again as an adult brings new worlds of meaning and perspective along with perhaps a new-found appreciation for why they are timeless stories to begin with.	2004-06-27

Lord of the Flies describes in detail the horrific exploits of a group of young boys who make an alarming transition from civilized to barbaric when they suddenly find themselves stranded on an island with no adults. Ralph is declared chief, and quickly determines that their main goal should be to keep a large fire burning so that passing ships will see the smoke and rescue them. There is a power struggle between Ralph and Jack, who is head of the hunters and obsessed with killing the pigs on the island. Jack finally wins and the majority of the boys decide to follow him, abandoning the efforts of the fire.<br />There were spots in which I found myself re-reading, trying to understand scenes being described. This book is written in the view of a young boy so the reader needs to understand that as a youth, his view of the world is somewhat limited; thus forcing the reader to imagine what the youth is describing with limited terms. There are many passages that require some adult interpretation and imagination. After adjusting to this style of writing, I became thoroughly absorbed by the story, finding my heart beating quickly near the end as I sympathized with Ralph and his efforts to remain civilized.	2004-05-28

In the innocent childhood of boys, the difference between savagery and society need to not only be learned but used.  In the parallels of adulthood and childhood mistakes must be made, which shows the other side of humanity.  Boys' contemplation of adults often differ from their intellect but change to their natural instinct.  When intellect fails and is replaced by instinct, survival gets lost in the fray of primal needs of power and the hunt.<br /><br />In this book, intellect struggles to survive amongst the power of instinct.  The decision of survival can last only as long as the next idea pierces the thought of those who have any power.  This theory proves why those chosen to rule must make decisions carefully, even if he needs to rob the use from a born leader.  In this book reason turns into overreaction.  The lesser people can still instigate fear among the powerful; an example of overreaction this book has to present.  The largest problem is that overreaction has consequences.  From fear comes destabilization.  Once destabilization comes, uprising follows.<br /><br />This book shows how conspiracies children think up can show in even the most civilized society in this era.  Dissent is common.  This book proves that responsibility can be found only among the responsible, and when left to rule the irresponsible make mistakes.  If modern society discarded religion, law, technology, and sophistication, what would happen?  Would we soon find reason among instinct?  No.  We are animals; as are every living creature on this planet, and we would act accordingly.  Our primal instinct would guide us through another period of time until reason is found and right is separated from wrong.<br /><br />If we were to go back to a primal state would we be allowed to call ourselves superior to other men?  If law is not upheld than man is nothing more than an animal.  William Golding probably made this book to enlighten the human race that primal instinct does eventually override every natural human sense.<br /><br />After a plane full of English children falls onto an uninhabited island two boys rally the children by blowing into a conch shell, making a harsh note that the other kids investigate.  After a short assembly the boy who found the conch, Ralph, is chosen to be chief, over Jack Merridew, the leader of a choir.  Ralph decides to make Jack and his choir the hunting committee.  He did not see the mistake in this.  Ralph naturally would be a rebel, because of his natural leadership.<br /><br />They decide upon a few hunters to maintain a fire so they could signal for a ship or plane to see so they could be rescued.  A few days after, the primal instinct takes over ensnaring the bored, scared, unruly, and senseless into a need for the hunt and envy for fresh meat.  Almost the only thing the hunters talk about is their own personal lusts of blood.  This lust soon carries the hunters to hunt, leaving the fire to flicker out of existence.  This was a huge loss because as the fire died a boat passed by and left no one but the hunters to blame that they would not be rescued.  After a short shouting match, the tides turn leaving Jack and Ralph to become enemies.  Days later Jack becomes unruly and says that he should replace Ralph as chief.  The tribes yearn for the hunt and want to become savages and use their primal instinct, but obediently the people vote in favor of Ralph, further angering the already angry Jack causing him to leave to create his own tribe.<br /><br />A few hours pass and Ralph soon realizes that some people are missing.  They take Jack's words to mind and know that the boys have left to join the other tribe.  Soon more people leave and he realizes the only ones left in his tribe are Sam, Eric, Piggy, and himself.  He knows that not much can be hoped for in the passing dawn and he prepares himself for an eternity on this island.  They have too few people to maintain the fire and that means they can't be rescued.  Helooks on to what his future will be and remains uncertain.<br /><br />You'll have to read the book to know what happens next.  This is an amazingly philosophical book.  This outstanding book needs some time to really understand but I found, and hope you will find reason in this book which may compel you to enjoy it as it did for me.

In Lord of the Flies, Golding tries to accurately portray human nature or at least as he saw it.  The underlying theme of this novel is the idea of good vs. evil or order vs. chaos.  The most notable struggle in the novel is between man and himself as the children fight with their instinct to live by rules against their instinct to act violently.  The story begins when a group of English school boys become plane wrecked on a deserted island.  In the beginning the group of stranded boys acts as one and cooperate well with eachother.  They attempt to gather food, make shelters and signal fires, and anything else they can do just to survive.  The novel's protagonist, Ralph, represents order and leadership.  He steps forward as the leader and oversees their efforts to survive as well as maintain some amount of order and decency among the group.  His sidekick, Piggy, is a chubby boy with glasses.  His glasses represent the power of science and intellect.  He also tries to help Ralph maintain order throughout the story.  At first they manage establish some rules and some sense of order on the island.  However, too many of the kids want to goof off and hunt animals rather than focus on survival or rescue.  Ralph's leadership gets ignored and the desire of the boys to fool around and live in chaos leads to the splitting of the boys into two camps.  Jack, the antagonist, represents savagery and the desire for power.  He manages to lure most of the boys away to join his camp of savages.  Ralph's camp represents good and Jack's camp represents evil.  Ralph's camp focuses on the rescue effort while Jack's camp decides to hunt, feast, and lie around.  The situation gets progressively worse as the values and morals of everyday civilization are lost.  What happens next makes this classic novel a must read for everyone.r everyone.	2004-05-11

But not this book.  I just found it boring and unrealistic, slow to get into and then still slow once I'd gotten into it.  The icing on the cake for me in my dislike of this book was when my ninth grade English teacher (who does this with this, her favourite book, for all of the classes she's had before and since mine, which was 1994-95) gave us a little lesson on the symbolism of this book.<br />I don't have a problem with symbols or allegory in a book, and thank God I've forgotten most of the symbols in this book (and in the other books she taught us).  It's interesting to realise, for example, that the conch symbolises order, but how is that going to give you some sort of epiphany while reading the book?  And everything in this book is a symbol-Piggy's glasses, some kid's scar, the obnoxiously-termed \\"littluns,\\" the conch, fire, Simon, the decapitated head of the pig, you name it.  Could we be any less subtle?  I, like most of the other students who had this woman for English, regardless of our respective religions, had no problem with the fact that Simon is supposed to represent Jesus, but the way our teacher presented this information made the Biblical account of Jesus's life and crucifixion seem like (no pun intended) the Gospel truth, telling it to us as though that's exactly how it happened, based on nothing but the Biblical account and not any opinions by scholars which might challenge the old view.  Her little lesson broke the Establishment Clause, and every time I see this book, I think back with revulsion and anger to that uncomfortable May day when she gave us that religious sermon in a public school.<br />Getting back to the book, it's incredibly unrealistic how these well-bred English schoolboys, none of them over the age of twelve, devolve into savage, unreasonable, wild, uncontrollable, murderous, unrestrained beasts after maybe two or three weeks on this island.  It's one thing for a sadist like Roger or a bully like Jack to go that way, but all of these boys, so quickly forgetting their high-class upbringings and education, losing hope of being rescued that soon and turning to setting fires and allegorically raping sows?  Maybe if they were older, or maybe if twenty years or so had passed, then it would seem believable for them to descend into animal madness due to being stranded on an island.  All humans have these primal base instincts within, but surely they're not brought to the surface after so short a period of time!  They should have still been sending signal fires, making shelters, and looking for fruit and water sources by the time the deus ex machina ending rolls around, not chasing one another around wearing pig's blood on their faces, brandishing spears, ghoulishly chanting \\"Kill the pig!  Spill her blood!,\\" talking to decapitated pig's heads, thinking the bogeyman is after them, and all while an out of control fire is raging on their island paradise.  Things don't happen that way.<br />This would have made a more believable story had the events taken place over maybe ten or twenty years, not two or three weeks, so we could see a natural and realistic progression from proper British schoolboys to wild marauding savages.  They're skipping a lot of steps in between.ese well-bred English schoolboys, none of them over the age of twelve, devolve into savage, unreasonable, wild, uncontrollable, murderous, unrestrained beasts after maybe two or three weeks on this island.

The first thing that got me was that this is very similar to the Catcher in the Rye when it comes to how fast I was able to read this without getting bored.

I loved how the story slowly started to turn to chaos and the boys one by one turned against eachother. Plus I liked the violence that this story had in it. I actually like this book so much that I am going to get my own copy and read it again.<br /> There are also some bad things that I didn't like about this book, but what book doesn't have its mixture of bad and good parts. One of the bad things was that some parts where difficult to understand and I had to read them a few times to finally get them. Another fault was that I have heard so many of the same &quot;stranded on an island stories&quot; and after awhile it gets on your nerves. Other than these things this book was very deserving of the 4 stars that I gave it. I would recommend this book for everyone except children under 10 because of some of the violence and High school level word usage.	2004-04-07

The book starts out pretty quickly, and anyone reading it could probably catch on pretty quickly. There has been a plane crash, and the only survivors are a number of British boys ages 4 to about 14.

Upon arriving at the island, they have a group meeting, and when Ralph is voted chief of the island, Jack is left as an also-ran.

This book is beyond the most boring and dull book in the world. It seems as if William Golding spend weeks on each paragraph and dialogue just to sound so 'absolutely intellectual to the highest extent'. From the looks of it, I'd say that he tried way too hard to impress his Oxford college friends. Unless if you are really into the symbolism or if you have a master's degree with an English major, then you would have been able to understand everything in this book. From every significant event, to every detail expressed about the children's actions or their surroundings, it is better to have Cliff Notes by your side if you wanted to catch every little segment of symbolism and importance.	2004-04-07

It began rather slow and dull and continued that way until about three- quarters of the way. I believed too much symbolism and much unnecessary high levels of vocabulary were used throughout Lord of the Flies. Considering this book is required to be read in the English classes of most high school students, I believed it should have connected to us in a more straightforward manner as in contrast to a symbolic way as it did. Furthermore, when I begin to read a novel I am usually brought in or attracted by the beginning of the book so I can keep interest in it. If I had not been required to read Lord of the Flies, I would have almost certainly stopped to read it due to the lack of enticement and hooks in the novel.<br /><br />  Towards the end of Lord of the Flies is where the book began to get interesting and truly began to hook me into reading more and even reading ahead of the class. Even though it gets good in the end, if you look at it from another point of view, things begin to get a bit out of perspective and maybe out of reality. That's when you must realize that these kids have been stranded on an island for an incredible amount of time and things can sometimes get out of control; you'll have to read the book to find out exactly what happens. Even though I didn't personally like Lord of the Flies, I still believe every sophomore should be required to read it due to the great storyline and I also believe it is different from most novels but in a good way.	2004-04-07

The friendship between Ralph and  piggy isn't just any ordinary friendship but more like one between a teen and a pet he has owned since he was a small boy.<br />The rivalry between Ralph and jack on the other hand is like that of two rampaging  behemoths who despise each other.<br />  I like this book because of the small amount of magical realism that was added to this book because i dont't like realism.  I don't like this book because of the descriptive senseless violence in it and also because I think that of kids that ages were stuck on an island the last thing they would think about would be hunting and killing.  I think that other people might enjoy this book when they read it becuause of the violence and action.	2004-04-07

It started off slow and at times I found myself trying hard not to fall asleep. The plot was actually quite interesting, but William Golding wrote it in such a way, sometimes I couldn't understand exactly what was going on. His word choice left me scanning through a dictionary a majority of the book. Yet this book did contain some quite profound symbolism. The theme would have to be the best party of  this novel, being it relates to the real world or the cruelties of the real world.<br />Some of the scenes in this book are actually quite violent, and unrealistic being that the kids are so young. In fact, numerous times I became sick to my stomach. Some of the scenes were good  and  beautifully written but overall I felt most of it was superfluous .	2004-04-07

Is not the type of book that a sophomore would want to read it everyday. The book is about a group of kids around the age of 11/12 that get stranded on an island. There are no adults or any kind of supervisors watching over them at all, so basically they are on their own. The group is around 15-20 kids. The kids get to choose a leader so they can have everyone in control so nothing can go wrong (even though there is always something that goes wrong).Then later on the book a lot of kids get hurt and there are no adults to help them. Well, I can't say no more because then I will give the end to the story and it wouldn't be interesting anymore, but you will enjoy it. Well, this book teaches you a lot of things like for example; it teaches you how to be more responsible and more mature about things. It also teaches you how to respect yourself and others; I do recommend you to read this.	2004-04-07

The only time that it caught my eye was when they first got stuck on the island and when they got off.  So basically,in the middle of this book, i wasn't listening.  This book had alot of realism and creativity that was probably the highest point of this book.  If I would have to pick a leader for them i wouldn't have picked any of them because they all act like animals.  And the events that took place like for one when they thought that Simon was the beast, that was just dumb to me.  I also gave it one star because it didn't deserve anyting better than that.<br />The friendship between Ralph and Piggy was odd.  Another thing that was odd was these kids had the urge to kill one another.  At the beginning of this book, I asked myself,&quot;How did all these kids survive but not one adult did?&quot; I think the book would have been a whole lot better if they had about 2 or 3 adults to keep the kids from talking about that ridiculous beast.  The Lord Of The Flies I read for an sophmore english class.  But the books that I read my freshman year like, Of Mice and Men, Romeo and Juliet, and To Kill a Mockingbird, those were good books and better books than Lord of The Flies.	2004-04-07

The conflict between Jack , Ralph, and piggy is a diaster waiting to happen! An example, of this would be,when Ralph exposes Jack , as he really is by saying &quot; you're a beast a swine and a blooy, bloody thief&quot;. Between Jack and Ralph were bad beore, but this is when everything exploded.  <BR>   The amity between Ralph and piggy is one of the strongest you would see in two people.  It's similar to a bond between a small boy an dhis pet dog.  It's great how they confided in each other and are able to trust in one another.  You could tell Ralph starts respecting Piggy when he says &quot;better Piggy than fatty&quot;.  From then on Ralph beganto listen to piggy.<BR>    The only negative thing I would have to say about this book is the way the kids act on the island.  I honestly don't think kids of that age would act like murderous savages.<BR>    In conclusion I think book is good for most ages.  I really think young people would like this book because it has action and adventure.	2004-04-07

In all honesty, &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is probably the most painfully boring story (and I use that word loosely) that I have ever had the misfortune of reading.  The plot is simple and the characters are presented in a way that makes them difficult to enjoy reading about.  The book is around 150 pages, which is strange, seeing that it took me about three weeks to finish because I had to will my eyes to lurch over every page.  Other than it being the most uninteresting book one can find, the characters make me equally angry.  I realize just as well as the next person that they're stuck on an island and that they're all younger than me, but these children are just unimaginably  dense throughout the story.  They become so out of touch with reality that they even take to hunting down their leader.  What am I supposed to find symbolic and interesting about that?  People keep going on about how this book is teaming with symbolism, but I'm just not seeing it, just because you have a bunch of kids stranded on an island doesn't mean that that relates to religion, society, etc.  Aside from the characters annoying me at a personal level, the way the author portrays them is even more ridiculous.  If William Golding spent half as much time on the plot, and not describing the children and scenery, he may have had a half-decent story on his hands.  If someone is looking for a decent book about survival, try &quot;The Stand&quot; by Stephen King, at least he made it interesting to read.	2004-04-05

On a literal level, this novel is simply a thriller in which a group of young private school boys find themselves stranded on a forsaken island.  At first, everything seems to go well.  The older boys form a community in order to mainatin order and ensure survival.  Over time, however, differences in opinions and personalities causes a gradual breakdown of the community until many of the boys turn their backs on order and even humanity, resorting to savage behavior.<br />The novel is Golding's exploration of why mankind resorts to savage and/or evil ways when faced with ruthless circumstances (WWII/Holcaust, etc.).  It is an engaging examination of the thin line between good/evil, human/inhuman, as well as a good read.	2004-04-05

Wang<br />P.5<br />Lord of the Flies is a story about of boys who crash on a unhabited island. There are no adults to control the boys, and they are free to do as they please. Ralph emerges as a natural leader, and Piggy is the intellectual with a disdain for physical work. Jack, leader of a choir, is another boy who disputes Ralph's society and becomes leader of the hunters. Slowly, the other boys all join Jack. A conch is found early on and is used to restore order at assemblies, but soon Jack ignores it and all the rules the Ralph has. Jack tribe is also composed of the &quot;littluns&quot; who see a &quot;beast&quot;. Eventually, two will fall forever, and Jack's tribe will degenerate substantially, killing pigs and making offerings to the &quot;beast&quot;.<br />William Golding described this book as attempt to trace the defects of society to the defects of individuals. This book relies heavily on symbolism, and whether likes or not depends on this point. I personally liked this book because of how it shows we degenerate. Jack and his tribe degenerate rapidly into savages. It is ironic when Jack says early in the book, &quot;We've got to have rules and obey them. After all, we're not savages. We're English, and the English are best at everything. So we've got to do the right things.&quot; Later in the book he is sitting on a log like an idol and finds unexplainable pleasure in torturing and killing a pig.<br />The degeneration of the boys can be easily compared to the degeneration of society. As a race, humans have destroyed places, eliminated far more species than any known organism, and spend much time killing each other. Events such as the tortures and procedure of the Inquisition, the Holocaust, the dozens of wars and border skirmishes, and some cultures' entertainment. At times, killing is perfectly acceptable, even encouraged. The degeneration of the boys, at their young age (the oldest is twelve) is unsettling. Their change can be compared to our behavior and defects.<br />My favorite part of the book is chapters three and four, the former being &quot;Huts On the Beach&quot; and the latter &quot;Painted Faces and Long Hair&quot;. You can see the boys reject society, playing and trying to hunt pigs instead of build shelters. In chapter four, a ship passes by, but Jack's tribe lets the fire go out because they are too preocupied with killing a pig. Jack's tribe starts the habit of their violent chant of &quot;Kill the pig. Cut her throat. Spill her blood.&quot; Jack's savage side can be seen when &quot;He took a step, and able at last to hit someone, stuck his fist into Piggy's stomach.&quot; He continues, striking Piggy's head and breaking half of his spectacles. This book is an attempt to find our faults, and a grim reminder of what &quot;civilized&quot; people can do.s unsettling.

The story has timelessness to it.  The plots and characters are very entertaining.  The first thing I noticed when I read the book was its reference to the atom bomb.  This is the author's way of giving a time for when the story occurred.  Also people were afraid of a nuclear war during those times so it sheds light on what life was like.  The author did an excellent job of describing the atmosphere.  He spent lots of time giving details on the characters and the island.  I liked this because it helps readers get a better feel for what the author intended them to imagine.  Another aspect I liked was how the boys developed into 2 societies showing the break that develops.  It was nice to see how the two groups had a difficult time working together.  It showed the stubbornness people could have when they feel they are right.  Inside the society the characters where very enjoyable with their thoughts and dialogue giving a very realistic sense.  Something I thought was unrealistic was the violence some of it seemed pointless.  Often I thought that it was not realistic.  Another part I hated was the dramatic character change as if the characters were always the same and the way they were.  The story started off innocent despite the accident and turned into this is in many ways also comparable to frame story.  It had little adventures in side the big story of survival.  The thing I liked most in the book was the conflict.  The boys who had split into tribes had to deal with and survive each other.  But they also had to deal with the conflict between themselves and the environment-facing extreme whether and hunger.  I would recommend this book to any one who likes action and lots of sometime over used detail.  This is a book that is hard to sit down once you start it.	2004-03-03

In the beginning it seems like the boys will have quite an awesome adventure--they are completely on their own with no adult supervision. One of the oldest boys, Ralph, attempts to get the others organized so that they will have food, shelter, and a rescue signal fire.<br />Ralph's logical approach to survival is soon challenged by Jack, the novel's antagonist, who is also in charge of the hunting. His desire for total power is quickly evident as he and his followers become increasingly wild, barbaric, and cruel. Their cruelty extends beyond simply hunting animals for food. Soon they are hunting and killing each other.<br />While I did not particularly enjoy reading this book, I believe that the way the different characters are developed is interesting. Each of the main characters seems to represent an aspect of human nature and society. For example, Ralph represents the civilizing instinct in human beings compared to savagery represented by Jack. Simon, who is shy and more sensitive than the others, seems to represent the natural goodness found in people. Roger represents exactly the opposite--he is sadistic and very cruel. I think my favorite character is Piggy, because he is a very logical thinker and smart. Because I found this character appealing, his murder was very disturbing to me.<br />Actually, the entire story was disturbing. It was hard to imagine that the boys waging this \\"war\\" against each other were so young--the oldest was only twelve years old. It was interesting to me that the more violent the story got, the older the boys seemed. I think what I didn't like was the implication that humans are innately evil. Goodness was portrayed as an aspect of civilization. As civilization deteriorated throughout the story, cruelty and violence increased. It seemed more natural to be evil than to be good. The severed pig's head (named the Lord of the Flies) mounted on the stake in the forest seemed to represent that innate evil. Since I don't believe that humans are naturally cruel and violent, I found this book difficult to read. It is not a book I would recommend.'s head (named the Lord of the Flies) mounted on the stake in the forest seemed to represent that innate evil.

Lord of the Flies by Golding is a perfect novel.<br />It is the story of English School boys during the war times. The boys are on an airplane heading for sanctuary from the war, but their ship crashes and the boys are deserted alone on an island in the middle of nowhere without any adults. The children plan to set up their own government to rule them. They believe they can create the perfect civilized government on their own. One of the boys even comments; &quot;We're not savages, we're British&quot;<br />But the boys soon give into their animalist urges of hunger and fear and turn into reck-looses and savages in the name of survivial.<br />This story is perfect social commentary.<br />Also like the children becoming savages with out parents to guide them; its an example of how humanity becomes animals without a God. As suggested by the very title of the book &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;; which is a biblical name for Satan (Beelzabub -Mt.10:25;12:24,26/Lk. 11:15/ Mk.3:22)<br />This book is a clear example of what happens when people worship the god of the earth by give into their animal instincts and choose to ignore the God the father.	2004-02-25

Though it wasn't quite as thrilling as I was expecting, I still enjoyed it, especially the way the author told the story.  Most of all, I enjoyed the way the author explored how violence tennds to become a part of human nature.

In the very beginning, the boys try to cooperate to find food, make shelter, and light a signal fire, therefore maximizing their chance of being rescued. They all elected Ralph as the leader since he seemed to know what to do to keep them alive.  However, some of the boys become lazy, and would rather play and have fun instead of work. As Ralph's power and influence over the other boys begin to decrease, his antagonist, Jack rises with power. Jack was the leader of the group of boys responsible for hunting. But soon Jack and his group of boys become obsessively fond with hunting and is overcome by a sort of frenzy. Soon he begins to paint his face giving himself the look of a savage. Disgusted of Ralph's rules, Jack and his group of boys split from the rest of the group and move to another part of the island. Soon after, the situation becomes worse, and Jack's \\"tribe\\" are now hunting Ralph's group. The former instinct of civilization and order has become savagery, violence, and chaos.<br /> Almost all the characters and elements in this book symbolize something. This book is not just about a struggle for survival on a deserted island, it is about a conflict between two types of human nature that both exist in every individual. The first is to live by rules, act peacefully, and do things for a common good. The other is to act violently, obtain power through force, and to satisfy individual's immediate desires. These two characteristics can be seen in the two major characters Ralph and Jack. The main conflict to the whole story is civilization versus savagery. The lord of the flies is a sow's head impaled on a stick. The sow had been killed by Jack and his hunters and its head was meant to be an offering to the beast that all the little boys seem to think is living on this island. The lord of the flies is implying that there is evil in every human heart, and this is the major theme of this book.<br /> Overall, I thought that this was one of those books that would make you think about all the hidden themes and ideas expressed throughout the book. This book, I believe, is a book that everyone should read.ry human heart, and this is the major theme of this book.<BR> Overall, I thought that this was one of those books that would make you think about all the hidden themes and ideas expressed throughout the book.

Forster)peopled with its shady, human-like silhouettes and snaps of muted color, provides a better glimpse than any other edition of an important theme of the novel--illusion, and its power to become real in the minds of those possessed by fear. Chimera.<br />I think this theme is as important now, as it has ever been, perhaps more so considering the recent fears in the most powerful nation on Earth. With fear and vulnerability gripping America, the world has turned from being an oyster to a threat. People are frightened by the stories churned out by their media. There is anger, feelings of extreme vulnerability in the face of the invisible. Leaders fan the breezes of these highly charged feelings to create monsters lurking on the fringes of stable, rational society, ready to tear it up. Democracy, in the face of such invisible, powerful threats, can seem altogether too inadequate and fragile. Another response--a more powerful one--is needed. Force, the erosion or elimination of democratic rights, the tightening of controls. And of course, hunting down the beast. To ensure that all this is accepted by the very people who have the most to lose, a leader maintains the illusion of dark, evil forces bent on the destruction of a nation. And so on....Think of Jack and his tribe...then think how it all came about.<br />Simon is the first to see that there is nothing to fear on the island, but the children themselves , with all their fears of the dark. Think of the littl'uns, missing the comfort, security and reassurance of adults, their parents. They cry at night, they see snakes twisting about in the jungle-fire (in reality the burning vines waving about as they are being consumed by the flames)and mistake their nightmares for the real thing. Jack capitalizes on their fear, while at first being afraid himself. He is a young child after all, which is easy to forget.<br />Right from the start Golding works in images of how the island paradise has the potential to be turned into something sinister and deadly. We hear the \\"witch-like\\" call of a bird, see the \\"skull-like\\" coconuts strewn under the trees. Is it all really there? It takes the active imagination of the human mind to turn trees, coconuts, birds and the jungle into something awful. Something that can kill. Our confidence that what we can apprehend \\"reality\\" directly through our senses is put into question, for it is always through an interpreting mind that our sense perceptions are filtered. Our terrified minds \\"see\\" snakes, moving shadows...\\"hear\\" witches shrieking in the forest, our bodies \\"feel\\" the cold touch of a creature crawling over us...and we react according to how we understand our sensations.<br />The lyrical prose of the novel helps us experience what the boys do through connotation, metaphor, simile. This is what literary language does best: offers us experience, rather than information. Golding, being the brilliantly suggestive writer that he is, does just that. He offers us images, illusions in the shape of lengthy, highly detailed and descriptive scenes, which make very real a dream-like, unreal experience. Simon's experience of the butterflies dancing is just one example of this. In the same chapter, a storm is moving up. Or is it a storm? Golding uses the image of a great battle brewing, with the added image of \\"drums rolling\\". Rather than being a natural occurrence, the storm is presented to us as a powerful army preparing to unleash itself on the small, isolated island. The army is put there by a human mind. And it becomes very real for both Simon and for the reader. By personalizing Nature,(which is how the children experience the island) we tend ascribe to it intentions and purpose. In this way, the storm becomes menacing and seems to focus on the children, forcing them to cower in their flimsy huts when it trummels the island.<br />And that brings meto the next point about illusion and reality. Not only are the boys creating reality, so is the reader for him or herself, by recreating through the words on the page a surrogate experience. Some reviewers mistake the words on the page for referring to a reality that they never lived. This is not to say that they are naive enough to believe that the novel is based on real-life, but they write as if there is some truth-value to the details. This is the conduit metaphor that Bruce Pirie writes about in _Teaching High School English_, which powerfully drives the reading and interpretation of much literature. What is missed is that stories, whether spoken or written, are always constructed affairs. And that pertains to any story, including our own descriptions of ourselves. We are not giving \\"reality\\" of our true self when we tell someone about who we are: we are presenting a version that we believe to be accurate and true. What gets left out is the amount of selecting of perceived personal attributes that go into the description of our self (the unique, single \\"self\\" being another illusion of Western society...how many \\"selves\\", do you construct and present to the world every day?).<br />Does Golding not wish us to consider how the use of language constructs the very reality that it is supposed to refer to? His very skill in getting readers to describe Jack, Ralph and the others on the island as though they were real and to live the children's experiences may attest to this to.... as well as a history of High Schools reading literature in a realist tradition.<br />Anyway, enjoy the novel...or the illusion of directly living another's experiences.

Ralph, 13 year old protagonist who led  a normal life; his life hit a tragic down spiral when he was in a plane with his Boy Scout troop heading on a tour of tropical islands. Their plane failed to fly and crashed into the ocean with no adult survivors. Ralph encounters many conflicts such as person vs. person, as in the time when he and Jack fought with closed fists until one of them gets hurt person vs. nature, like the time when the raging hurricane whips through their island and destroys everything in it's path and lastly person vs. self, when Ralph doubts himself and is stressing his decisions. Many of the camp members turn against him and go out on their own, it is up to Ralph to stay alive and help his companions, but can he tame a lawless beast like the hunters?<br />I found this novel flawless and exhilarating; William Golding did a truly great job on this awesome novel. The author made me feel Ralph's pain and also made me feel Jack's anger. It made me feel as if I was one of the boys in the group, choosing which side to take, the hunters or Ralph. I felt the joy the hunters had when they killed their first pig, and their fear when they encountered the beast. I found myself reasoning with the hunter's plans but saw the point of Ralph's logic to stick together. I felt the shocking thunder and the clash of waves during the hurricane and felt the adrenaline rushing through my body. Even though all of these things were great I also saw some flaws in the book. I felt as if the wild pig detail was kind of weird; how that in the middle of the ocean on a deserted tropical island there would be pigs, other than that one detail I felt the book was magnificent.	2004-01-29

Golding wrote his book with young readers in mind--the very sort that would enjoy action, and adventure. And perhaps more so young male readers as his experiences of children and their behavior are from a boy's school playground.<br />Some reviews have the effrontery to suggest that this Nobel prize winner adjust his style to accomodate their laziness. To that I say... Nuts! The ignorance is in proportion to the self-righteousness of the young critics who are prompted by their teachers to write such tripe. And there is no shortage of opinionated critics who haven't made the least effort to try to understand the book or attempt to read authorially or for that matter examine themselves in a critical light.<br />At least have the curiousity to find out more. There are plenty of smart readers within easy reach. If nothing else, read the Coles Notes, York Notes or any critical guide for that matter to get a sense of how much one can get from reading and re-reading this book. Is it really cheating if you do it responsibly? And by the way, there is a purpose to the book's detailed (what some impatiently call the \\"boring\\"  and \\"long-winded\\") scene descriptions. Find out what critics say.<br />The beauty of the novel (the writing, that is) lies in the poetic descriptions that we are offered. Some reviewers talk about the \\"realistic\\" flavor that Golding brings to the story. Far from being \\"realistic\\" I see these scenes as having a dream-like and timelessness about them. When Simon lies in a trance in his hiding place near the clearing, watching the butterflies above the tall grass, there is a sense that time has stopped. Human time has little significance on the island. Watching butterflies may be \\"realistic\\"; but the full value of the scene comes through the words which form the less-real images in our reading minds. They are vivid, but being \\"realistic\\" is hardly the point of the scenes. Experience is. A very new, strange, unusual feel to our lives. Isn't this the value of writing literately? Not to offer realistic images of \\"real\\" life but to offer unspoken, often unthought but very much felt experience and sensation. Anyway, the butterfly scene connects to another one, where some of the littl'uns are playing at the edge of the beach. The narrator offers up images of distant shores and time and the movement of rock and sediment. The sheer scale of cosmic time compared to the puny activities of the children (pooping, hunting, fighting, squabbling) is breathtaking. The narrator treats us to poetic visions--what some reviewers lumpishly call \\"all that long-winded description.\\" To cut scenes like this out would be like reducing a poem to some prosaic \\"message\\" and claiming that it all \\"boils down to the same thing\\". Such nonsense.<br />A teacher's chestnut for this novel (judging from some of the reviews) is to have a trial to wind things up. I cringe when I hear this.

There are no grown ups to show them how to live, but they soon meet more children and band together.  As problems unfold, Inherent evil takes over in this masterpiece of human psychology.<br />Author Bio: William Golding was born in the village of St. Columb Minor in Cornwall.  He started writing at the age of seven, but he didn't pursue it until after attending Brasenose College, in Oxford.  His first book, which was no more than a collection of poems, was finished one year before getting his B.A.  After graduation, he moved to London and wrote plays.  He lived in a settlement house, but moved to Salisbury in 1939.  He enlisted in the Royal Navy during WWII, and hated it.  He called it \\"a waste of four years of my life.\\"  After the war he returned to Salisbury with a dark view on humanity's processes.  His first novel: The Lord Of the Flies was declined by 21 publishers, but when it did get published in 1954 it was an instant hit in England and a bestseller in America.  After that he wrote The Inheritors (1955), PINCHER MARTIN (1956), FREE FALL (1959), THE SPIRE (1964), RITES OF PASSAGE (1980), THE PAPER MEN (1984), CLOSE QUARTERS (1987), FIRE DOWN BELOW (1989), and THE DOUBLE TONGUE, left in draft at his death, was published in 1995.<br />Evaluation: I've heard many things about this book.  That is the reason I decided to read it, and I must say, it lived up to every single expectation.  The pessimistic view on human nature is frighteningly real, and it is portrayed through an entertaining adventure story with a group of children stranded on an island.  My favorite character was Piggy because he was the rational character.  He was the intelligent member of the democratic \\"tribe\\" on the island, and a tragic hero in the end.  The Antagonist on the island was Jack.  He started as a good-natured leader of the hunters.  This physical job eventually brought out the inherent evil that Golding thought was in every human being.  All hell breaks loose when the hunting tribe splits from the rational tribe, and they go on a pig hunt.  This is, in my opinion, the best scene ever portrayed in a book.  The haunting image of a skewered pig's head that represents the devil sticks in my mind whenever I think of the book.  He takes the innocent life of Simon hours before the other children do.  The end of the book is tragically ironic when the Navy man walks in on a childish manhunt, yet he is doing the same exact thing on his ship.  An easy read, but unbelievable book.  I give it 5 out of 5 stars, and it's now my favorite book.ob eventually brought out the inherent evil that Golding thought was in every human being.

I have to give it a 5 because, to me, it is better than the 4 it has. Probably it is being rated against other classic and we expect so much of it. Compared to most recent books I would give it a 5. This is an exciting book. The characters are excellent. They are realistic and give us a good look at who we (humans) are. The kids do natural things that we did as kids but the consequences are more severe because of the situation. It reminds me that we all could have been Nazis.<br />It is refreshing compared to all the \\"socially significant, politically correct stuff written to make us feel good (feel we are good).	2004-01-05

I think the author had a great idea on his hands when he decided to write this. Perhaps the author had trouble getting it on paper? I know some of my classmates feel the same when I say it wasn't as well-written as it could have been. I'm not saying he didn't use big enough words! He was extremely wordy, and a little too descriptive at times. I have nothing against words, as I love books myself. But, there was a point in the book (and I don't want to spoil this for people who haven't read it,) where he discussed things about blood staining sand, and the beast being dead, and 3 pages later which were FULL of description, we see, &quot;and Simon's dead body drifted out to sea,&quot; or something very similar. And all he would have needed was that last sentence! He didn't NEED 4 pages of blood and gore! But, alas. It isn't like we can have all the books turn out how we want them. My English teacher saw me with a book by Tolkien, &quot;The Silmarillion,&quot; and she said,<br />&quot;No Tolkien until after 'Lord of the Flies!'&quot; Well, I've had enough of &quot;Flies.&quot;<br />No more 'Lord of the Flies'!<br />What I need is 'Lord of the Rings'!<br />Sincerely,<br />A total book worm who breathes for Fiction Fantasy.	2004-01-05

I thought that the idea of the book was very good and the theme was well thought out, but i don't think it was well written. Some parts could have been better, but it was interesting. Somethings I disliked were that there were only boys on the island and no girls. If there were girls I think the story would have been different. I also didn't like how Piggy died. I think the book would have had a better ending if Piggy stayed alive.<br />Some things that i liked about the book were most of it was realistic. The schoolboys made rules for themselves, and there became two sides. I liked how the characters were described and how the meanings of their names mathed their actual names.	2004-01-04

I think that the idea, or theme of the book was well thought out, but I don't really think that is was well written. Golding had a good theme to his book, about how we still have wild instincts that are just covered up by civilization until we feel the struggle to survive or the threat to our own life.  Golding book was, in my thought, not well written. It was overly descriptive at some points, to the point where it lost your interest. After finishing the book, it was easier to understand, thinking through the whole story without being held back by Golding's descriptive periods. I did not enjoy this book, though projects used to review the book in the classroom were fun and interesting.	2004-01-03

It shows humans acting at their most basic, primal level, which to us in modern times is the worst level.  This level is one of instincts, fear, and a will to dominate and survive.  However, Golding is in many parts too wordy, which interferes with the flow of the plot.  I recommend this book to anyone who does not mind a little bit of gore.	2004-01-03

He delved into the true, hidden nature of humans; our origin as an animal. In his book, a group of young boys are stranded on an island without any adults. They set up a society with rules, goals, and a leader. Of course, this society fails miserably. Rules are disregared, goals are forgotten, and the leader is overthrown. Their miniature civilization degrades into chaos. The implication is that civilization as a whole is just a thin mask that covers our more primal nature.<br /> The idea is well thought out and interesting. However, Golding focuses on the details of the boys' existance and the symbolism of the story to the point that the story itself is lost. The only remotely interesting part is the end, when he stops focusing on the symbolism as much and lets the story drive home the points that he tries to make throughout the book.<br /> If you want an examination of human nature, then read this book.<br />If you want an adventure story, look elsewhere.	2004-01-01

Maybe if I reread this book at a later time in my life I may be able to like it better. I'm not sure.

William Golding uses his excellent skills of being able to switch looks that he creates on characters by using a hefty amount of details. The details provide readers with the feelings of other characters. When I read books, I enjoy books that have plenty of details that make your reading more vivid in your imagination and allow you to feel as if you are in the story too. I like how Golding creates different adventures inside one big adventure to make the novel have more excitement and more creativity. William Golding is known for his outstanding conflicts in his stories. His books always have more conflicts than others because his are more enjoyable. For instance William has a conflict between the setting and a conflict between the characters. Most authors just have conflict in the characters. I enjoyed this book more than most books and that is why I recommend you to read this. If you enjoy action and like plenty of details then this is the book for you.	2003-12-17

This book seems to capture every element that I hate.<br />For starters, the book drops you onto this island. They never truly describe what \\"the scar\\" is exactly. Then we watch as Ralph and Jack become bitter enemies. I really hated Ralph and Jack from the beggining mostly because they seem way to immature. Now, if I was 10 or 13 and such... I would not resort to killing people after like the second week. Then there is the fact of Ralph. Ralph is really arrogant of Piggy's feelings and eventually starts becoming annoying. Piggy is the only real character I liked next to Simon. Jack is really arrogant also. He is so immature that it is almost laughable. Didn't these kids come from a private school? My gosh, to think that one week on an island could make some of the worst sins be committed by 10 year old boys....<br />The whole detail of the story becomes a little to fine for its own good. The pictures the author describe have no meaning to me. Apparently there is a square, pink piece of land jutting out of the beach. What? The whole end of chapter 3 was the worst when Simon walks through the forest. I just stopped caring about how that blade of grass was bent at a 76 degree angle.<br />For those who want a great book try Tolkien or R.A. Salvatore. If you hate fantasy then why are you contemplating buying this book? That is all it is. I know I wouldn't kill someone after one week on an island. P.S. The book isn't \\"terrifying\\".	2003-12-15

I at first thought that this book would not keep my attention. As I read on I became more and more interested in this book. The idea of having a group of children varying in age stranded on an island was very fascinating. I didn't know how they would react to this situation they were placed in and that's part of the reason this book kept my interest.<br /> At first the kids thought it was fun not having any adult supervision. The boys agree to work together with Ralph trying to maintain order by assigning various chores such as keeping a signal fire going that they started with piggy's glasses and gathering food. However, the chores stop being done and their society breaks down. This reaches its peak when Ralph sees a ship in the distance and the signal fire is out. The hunting boys were supposed to keep it going and before Ralph can scold them they come back with a kill. This turns the kid's loyalty toward Jack. I thought this was the most interesting part of this book. I enjoyed how it showed the struggle in society between order and lack of it. As jack gains power among the boys, Ralph finds himself suddenly being hunted by his former friends. These kids turned savages show no remorse when they kill one of their own with there bare hands and teeth. I found it very compelling how these civilized kids can suddenly deliberately want to kill one of there former friends. However, the reason I gave this book a three out of five was the ending. There was great action throughout the book and then it suddenly ends just by Ralph running out of the jungle to see a British Naval Officer.<br />  This books characters exemplify three distinct aspects of human nature. Jack shows mans roots in his primitive behavior. He opts to hunt and be free, shirking the duties that could ultimately rescue him. Ralph's character shows the desire of man to be civilized yet be free and wild as well. He wants to be rescued but at other times is intrigued by the hunt and wild side of human nature. He shows his desire to be rescued by trying to keep order and have chores. Oppositely, he is overwhelmed by the hunt and ultimately kills his friend in the fatal attack on the beach. Finally, Piggy is on the opposite spectrum from Jack. He is constantly reminding the others of the proper way to act and mentions adult's behavior as an example. These characters represent the constant struggles that live inside mankind in everyday life.<br /> In conclusion, this was a great book to read. The plot was exciting with the exception of the mundane ending. It is a book that can be read on many levels and with characters that represent struggles that continuously plague the human mind.

They are also the only survivors on the whole plane. This novel takes place in the late 1990's. The boys our forced to live on their own, and do whatever is possible to keep them alive.  Obviously, everything isn't working out just the way they would have liked it to, and they have to face many troubles along the way.  Later on in the book, the boys end up turning on each other.  I enjoyed reading how they interacted in such a tough situation.  I could never image what I would do in that type of situation, and hearing how other people reacted was neat.  Nobody would ever think something like this could happen, and very few people would be able to survive living alone on a deserted island.  It shows the reality of a true human society because people really are selfish and cruel and will do anything to look out for themselves. It really makes you think about human instincts. Soon after, when you are under the pressure of survival you will end up emotionally breaking down, and doing what is best for you, and only you.  I think this book would be most suitable for a teenage, adventurous boy.  Lord of the Flies is one of those books that keeps you wondering what will happen to the boys next, and you keep on reading. Because of its intriguing plot of survival of a young crowd, the book was hard to put down.	2003-12-04

I especially liked the way Golding built up and created the characters in the book.  Ralph and Jack were the main characters in his story and also in my review.  I felt that I was able to connect to both of them in different ways.<br /> Ralph was a very charismatic leader in the way he spoke and the way he carried himself.  He was strong and seemed to be the only kid on the island thinking straight.  Ralph's thought process was adult like and very advanced for most twelve-year-old kids.  Although there isn't much in Ralph's character to pick on, I will say one thing.  I felt when he and Piggy were being threatened they should have tried a little harder to stand up for themselves.  He was a strongly spoken person but didn't like to be violent in any way and wasn't sure how to take care of threatening situations when all alone.  I'm not saying he should have also resorted to killing, as the others did. I feel he should have tried to at least build some sort of shelter in a secluded part of the island to protect he and Piggy from \\"the hunters\\".  Even with his faults in my mind he was a much better leader than Jack.<br /> Jack was the exact opposite of Ralph in my mind.  His character was great and it was interesting to read about both Jack and Ralph in the same novel.  When Ralph asked for order Jack would fire back with profanity and defiance of all attempts to be civil on the island.  Jack's character is also hard to criticize because I was able to see were he was coming from in his thinking.  Yes he did go a little far, but we never knew how we would act when faced with the same situation.  If I were to pick at the character of Jack I would have to pick at all the hunters.  I can't see how the young kids could have become so violent toward everything and care so little about life.  That was a little unbelievable but I still enjoyed the story line.<br /> I like the way this book was put together from the beginning to the end.  The mounting suspense kept me wanting to read more.  The only complaint I have about the structure of the story is the end.  It just ended, it wasn't a bad ending, but I felt like I was left with a lot on my plate.

All of my critiques are purely my attempt to find something in this novel to pick on.  I felt that the novel was very well written and I liked all the characters to some extent.	2003-12-04
US	23514155	R2GGFRTBSL7L8L	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Great Book	Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, was an interesting book. I enjoyed the book because I like adventurous books, and I like the plot of the book. If you don't like stories with only children characters and an outdoor setting I don't recommend this book. The book is set on a deserted island. A plane crashed and stranded a whole bunch of kids on a small deserted island with no adults. The kids make an adventure out of the situation and form a tribe and pick a chief. The kids build huts on the beach and hunt for pigs, which are the best source of food on the island. I especially like the fact that Golding had added symbolism into the story and it was very interesting to me. Some of the symbolism that stood out to me was the conch as a symbol of authority and bought the whole group together. Piggy as a symbol of intelligence, Simon as a symbol of imagination. Throughout the book, there is one boy who is ridiculed at every chance, and only one boy tries to defend him. There is a constant battle for power between the boys named Ralph, who is sensible and only concerned with getting rescued, and the boy called Jack, who is a savage and only thinks of hunting pigs and having fun. After heated arguments that split the boys in two tribes. A hunting tribe and a tribe to try to get rescued. Ralph was clearly always the more rational of the two as he constantly focused on trying to have people build shelters, and a fire, which he hoped would eventually be what saved them. Jack had a strange desire for hunting and no care with what happens to them on the island. Piggy seems like a bright child with good ideas, but because of his silly appearance he receives no respect from the other kids. Again I enjoyed this book it kept my attention thought the whole time I was reading it. It was a great story to read and be apart of I would defiantly recommend  this book to a friend.	2003-12-03

As I read-on I became more and more interested in this book.  There were times that I was not able to put it down because it was so intriguing to me.  The thought of this group of young boys on an island all by themseleves without any parents just fascinated me.  I didnt know what would happen and I beleive that's part of the reason this book kept my interest.<br />I thought that the most interesting part of this book was when Jack turned against Ralph and decided to take charge of his own tribe.  I really never saw it coming and when it did; I couldn't put the book down.  This book revealed what I thought was &quot;inner human&quot; evil.  I thought that it was very interesting reading about Jack and his crew members wanting to kill these other boys that they were friends with not so long ago.<br />I would defiantly recomment this book to anyone.  It was a great read for anyone that likes adventure.  This book kept me on my toes the entire time; I was always wondering what was going to happen next.  I did think that the beginning of the book started off sort-of slow, but I beleive it was just so that the needed information to understand the story was brought forward.  After the first chapter though, it was a wonderful story.	2003-12-03

The book is social commentary.  The boys, stranded on an island, develope a society not unlike the global society.  In the end, when they are picked up by a warship, the ship is doing exactly as the boys were on the islannd.  This tragic novel, is great in demonstrating the &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;.  With its 3- dementional characters, it is a book that I would recomend to anyone, young and old.  But please, when reading it look at it on many different levels, don't jest take the entire story literally.	2003-11-20

Becuase of its lessons that are used tiem and time again, even today. The story of the plane crash of British schools and their journey afterwards isn't merely a childs tale of survival, but rather a much broader theme of animal instinct vs. human behaivor. Much of the book discusses the two primary characters, Jack and Ralph, and their journey of rule. Jack has an autocratic system of rule, while Ralph relies on a more democratic system. I guarantee this book to anyone looking to have a good read, or even if they are looking for something deeper than that.	2003-11-17

Although I found this novel tedious at times, I believe it is well written and held my attention the majority of the time.  Golding definately knew what he was talking about.  The situations in the book are realistic.  I can imagine young boys turning into savages after spending enough time on an island... without grown-ups.  The theme of this novel is not purely political or social.  It deals with the capacity for evil in all humans.  Even in &quot;civilized society&quot; there is corruption.  By the way, there is no cannibalism in this novel... I don't know why that rumor is so widespread, but it's not true.  This is not the novel for you if you're looking for something light-hearted and simply enjoyable to read.  It is a serious novel that deals with moral issues that are still relevent today.	2003-11-09

He was an English novelist who won the Nobel Prize in 1983. He was educated at Marlborough Grammar School, which was where his father taught, and at Brasenose College in Oxford; he graduated in 1935. He became a schoolmaster in a school in Salisbury and joined the royal navy in 1940. After the invasion of France, he began teaching again until 1961. He published Lord of the Flies in 1954, Free Fall in 1959, The Spire in 1964, Darkness Visible in 1979, Rites of Passage in 1980 (won the booker prize) in addition to its sequels Close Quarters in 1987 and Fire Down Below in 1989. He was knighted for his accomplishments in 1988, and died 5 years later in 1993.<br />The main idea that the author is trying to present deals with society. Golding is trying to convey that without the principles, conditions, or standards of society, individuals lose these values; without order, there can only be disorder. Thus, without rules, the ability to differentiate between right and wrong is lost, leading to chaos.<br />The novel takes place during a war, which is unmentioned. A plane that is carrying a group of British students is shot down somewhere over the Pacific Ocean and crashes. The pilot dies and the children find themselves alive on this uninhabited island without any adults. Ralph, one of the oldest of the survivors, along with his friend Piggy, find a conch shell. Ralph blows the conch, and gathers the survivors and the novel begins from there. Events lead to the death of Piggy and Jack, one of the choirboys, to take control of the group of children. The boys start hunting Ralph, and Ralph runs to the beach where a naval officer arrives with a ship. The boys then get to go home after the officer thinks they have been playing games.<br />As I said before, the author is stating: without the rules brought by society, the difference between right and wrong is clouded. I agree with the author because his novel was the perfect example of his message. It seems as though society is represented through a conch the characters carried around with them. After the conch was broken, society diminished from the island and the boys resorted to violent ways of attaining order; the hunters and the hunted. When the naval officer arrives, society's rules are again present on the island, and the boys become civilized again. This whole novel is a fair representation of what can go wrong without the standards of society. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a novel that deals with human nature and survival, because it so graphically and accurately depicts it.ouded.

Lord of the Flies is about a group of young English boys whose planes crashes onto a remote island. Throughout the novel the boys gradually changed from civilized English boys to small savages that need to survive. The author used many metaphors and Imagery to describe the situations and places on the island. All the places in the island where described very well for example when Ralph first used the conch to call the other boys. The author says, \\"Ralph pursed his lips and squirted air into the shell, which emitted a low, farting noise\\"(Golding 15). That line tells the reader exactly how he blew the conch and he described how he put his lips on it and what sound it made. He uses very descriptive words in that line and the reader feels like they are standing right next too them. The authors metaphors are also another good use of litery technique it in the book. William Golding also uses alliteration in this next example. This quote is when Jack is ready to hunt the beast. \\"He gave a wild whoop and leapt down to the pale sand\\"(Golding 52). \\"Wild whoop\\" would be alliteration and could also be considered onomapeia. The \\"pale sand\\" is a metaphor because it described what the sand looked like. William Golding used many literary techniques in this book, which make the book more interesting and fun to read. Lord of the Flies by William Golding was very interesting and fun too read. I liked how the author described many aspects of the island and the creatures that lived on it. The book was very detailed so I always knew what was going on, because it felt like I was right there.  I enjoyed reading Lord of the Flies because it was very interesting. It described so many things that I could imagine being next to one of the characters. Lord of The Flies proved to be a great adventure novel. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read adventure novels and people who enjoy a novel with a good ending.<br />Works Citied<br />1.) Golding, William.  Lord of the Flies.

When I first heard abuot this book, it was in my grade 10 english class, and I assumed that like so many of the books we read, this would be just another boring novel to be tested on. As there was to be a quiz on the first and second chapter, and I figured I wouldn't bother with the book, i read the Sparknotes version. Well the sparknotes version definetly caught my attention, and made the book seem more interesting than I originally assumed, so i decided to actually read the assigned pages. The only problem was that once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down! i was finished the book within 2-3 days while the class was still on the fifth chapter or so, i couldn't believe how good this book was!

Well, I think that symbolism is based on your own opinion. We don't know that the author meant to have this particular thing represent this particular idea. When you get to the story itself, the first four chapters and the last four chapters are worth a read. However, everything in between I found to be very boring and you find yourself having to stop and re-read certain things because you forget what is happening; there is no action to help keep you up to speed.<br />Just FYI, I didn't have to read this book for school. I read it in my spare time. From what I understand, those who must read it for school have a far lower opinion of this novel, but I don't know that for a fact.	2003-10-17

This book I found took a while to get into but had a good way of starting. I love the plot and how everything turns out at the end. The story starts of well but soon enough the children become scared because of the &quot;beast&quot;.<br />The group is split into two. Ralph and Piggy end up by themselves and Jack and his tribe become a bit obbsessed with the beast. They are the hunters and almost become to caught up in being standed on the island and fending for themselves.They go to far and end up doing things that are quite shocking for anyone espeshally children. The group  become to over the top and they end up just not caring about their old friends anymore.<br />One of the main points in the book is the fire. They decide to make a fire and keep it going so that passing planes nad ships would be able to find them. When the fire is left to go out and a plane passes the island Ralph and Jack have the fight that almost leads to jacks death.<br />The tribe and jack and piggy are always stealing and fighting and even when people get hurt and things are getting out of control. Alot of the book is very sad and it just shows you what could happen if people did get stranded on the island. Toward the end things are going crazy and before they find adults theey almost burn down the island trying to find Ralph.<br />When the children suddenly become in contact with adults at the end again they act as if they have woken up from a very long dream. They start crying and everything hits them that has happened in the last few weeks. They tried to act like adults and make rules but things definatly didint go as smooth as im sure all of them wanted.	2003-09-29

Even without the supervision and direction of parents to help them, the boys try to get organized.

Ralph.<br />  Golding uses a lot of desciption to make you feel as though this could actually happen. He creates a realistic microcosm (a little &quot;world&quot; that represents a bigger world), with a government and a trouble-maker, that shows what humans resort to in times of desperation. The climax of the book is a good surprise, but it ends too quickly without enough explaination to understand it easily. I enjoyed the story, but Golding repeats things too much, and I didn't even like those parts when I read them the first time. Jack talks about hunting too much, Ralph talks about keeping the fire going too much, and I hate the song the hunters sing. It repeats killing the beast and spilling its blood over and over, and they sing it all the time. Without these annoying repeats and the short boring periods spred throughout the book, I would say that the Lord of the Flies is a great story (but it is not written like one.)	2003-09-29
US	32336537	R33U335IIJ00UO	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Review:	In high school, I remember thanking my lucky stars that I didn't have to read this. My friends all whined about it, and I considered myself lucky that I didn't have to endure the torture. Now that I've read this book, I feel like I missed out. I would have enjoyed reading and discussing this book in high school.<br />Lord of the Flies is the story of a group of English boys who are planed wrecked on an deserted island. The oldest of the children are around 12-years-old, and the youngest around 6-years-old.<br />It amazed me how so many of the boys didn't even realize what was giong on. I realize they are children and it probably seemed like an adventure, but it seems like they would have been aware that they had an accident. They seemed so &quot;unaware&quot; of what happened. At first, the boys saw their getaway from the adults as an adventure, but as the story progresses they start to delve into the &quot;darkness in their heart&quot;.<br />I don't even know where to begin with this books. There are so many themes that could be adressed. You could look at humans innately animalistic nature (that doesn't make them much better than animals), you could look at how the boys &quot;society&quot; paralleled the war-stricken world they lived in, or you could ponder on the &quot;loss of innocence&quot;. Golding managed to pack many themes ranging from psychological matters to the relationship between people.<br />I truly enjoyed this book. It's one of those books that you have to read more than once (or once very slowly) to grasp the many different elements presented to you. The only thing that I didn't like about this book is how Golding seemed to sometimes ramble about the landscape. Don't get me wrong. I wanted to know about the island, but he seemed to go on and on about one thing, and I would wonder if it would ever end.	2003-09-29

While i did enjoy the basic storyline, Lord of the Flies was written in a way that i found extremely confusing and basically uninteresting. The parts of it that i acctually understood weren't so bad though.<br />In the start of the novel, a lot of young boys find themselves trapped on an island with no adults. In the first few days that they are there they elect a leader, set up rules, and get an organized camp going. They seem to be used to having rules and regualtions, and no one objects to this. There are some important main characters in this book. Ralph is the civilized, rational figure who is elected cheif in the beginning. He knows what needs to be done to get rescued, and throuout the book he is focused on that. Then there is Jack, who turns out to be the &quot;bad guy&quot;. He wants to be the cheif, and he really isn't interested in doing productive things, he wants to hunt instead. Piggy is the wise figure in this novel. His ideas always are the obviously correct thing to do, but because he is somewhat of a nerd, no one really listens to him and most of what he says is shot down.<br />Throuought this book civilization goes down the drain. Jack eventually breaks off from the rest of the group with his hunters, and soon enough all the boys except for the little ones, Piggy and Ralph join his tribe to feast, dance and have fun.<br />The conch, the shell that symbolized organization and power in the start of the novel, is smashed into thousands of pieces, which shows us that the morals and society of the boys has completely died. The beast, which all the boys are afraid of, symbolizes the fear that we all have of the unknown. It seemed that every word in Lord of the Flies had some deep hidden meaning, which i felt made the book tedious and confusing. Yes, it is a good book, but would i read it again? No.	2003-09-29

All the parents on the plane have died, so this big group of boys has to fend for themselves.  A big part of this story is about how the boys still create rules to govern the island.  A leader comes around named Ralph, who has continuous argumments with Jack, the oldest, who himelf wants to be in charge.<br />Things start off well, but sitings of a beast on the island scare many.  One of the boys named Piggy, a very intelligent, but not liked boy, has great ideas and tries to get everyone to listen to Ralph and do what he says.  One thing Ralph is big on is keeping a rescue fire going.  Jack, makes a group of hunters to get meat and when their out hunting the fire goes out as a plane flew by, but couldn't tell anyone was there because there was no smoke.<br />Ralph and Jack get into a huge argument that ends up seperating the boys into a group of rebelious hunters lead by Jack and the other group with Piggy and Jack.  Jack's group has all but Piggy and jack.  Gruesome and odd ending chapters see the end of some as the hunters kill them.  The leadership and rules set on this island fall apart, and shows how rules can diminish is a second and things can turn ugly fast.  This book was a very good one to read, it had a an ending that leaves you thinking, and a story that makes you think about your own life, and a great story about these boys on an island who have to fend for themselves, create rules, and watch things diminish and change drastically after disagreements and a fight for power take place on this island.  I reccomend this book to anyone who is looking fo a fun and interesting story to read, that has a great ending that leaves you thinking about what's next.	2003-09-28

The way Golding starts the story you can tell that you're going to be for quite a ride, as he places you right in the middle of the action, perhaps to give you the chance to understand the confusion the children faced.<br />This book begins with the children being thrown on an island and having to figure out a way to survive. They eventually seem to get themselves pretty well organized except for a few lazy workers. Then we start to see more and more people neglecting their work and this eventually turns into a small rebellion that continues to grow throughout the book.<br />Since coming to the island the only two people there who had the ability to lead the group was Jack and Ralph. Ralph was clearly always the more rational of the two as he constantly focused ontrying to have people build shelters, and a fire, which he hoped would eventually be what saved them.<br />Jack had a strange desire for hunting that slowly grew into a sick obsession by the end of the book. Jack eventually becomes fed up with the way Ralph is running things and branches away from the group. Support for Jack's group slowly grows as the book goes on. Either a desire to hunt or an unwillingness to work eventually causes just about everyone to leave Ralph's group except for Piggy.<br />Piggy seems like a bright boy with good ideas, but because of his silly appearance and the complete disrespect he recieves from the other kids no one ever pays attention to him. The ironic part about it is that the cause of all the chaos on the island was the absence of an adult, which except for his age, was basically Piggy.<br />While the children in the hunters group feared only the beast as they went on their daily hunts, Piggy and Ralph had to contstantly live in fear of the other children, who had become scary and unpredictable. The children in the hunters group revolved their entire world around the beast, who they had all accepted as real at this point. In this world they forgot about ever trying to get back home and seemed out of touch with reality as they casually talked about killing their friends.<br />Another friend of Ralph's on the island was Simon, who never had much to say , but you could tell had a lot on his mind.<br />To emphasize the drastic downward spin the islands tiny society had taken he punished the only two children Ralph could trust and readers had come to know.<br />When the children all finally come back into contact with an adult he acts as an escape back to reality from the strange imaginary world that they had created.r entire world around the beast, who they had all accepted as real at this point.

The idea is to have a few boys from a  far away military camp crash in the middle of no where. They would have to survive on there own. Even Ralph the one who has the toughest time out of all the boys trying to be the leader but some retaliating must have been hard to come up with. Piggy the less suited for the tragedy was in need for help with after all of the harassment. The name piggy explains it all. Even before the disaster. Jack, the biggest savage of them all, was the most unhelpful. Between all of the fights and Piggies tragic ending, he was the one who caused the most problems.  Even when they went hunting for Ralph he was the one with the blood thirsty eyes. The littleuns had problems all of the time being scared and all. The twins samneric must have been very horrified when the saw the (BEAST) or the dead man in the parachute. All of the sightings of the beast made the suspense even more. The rummaging through the forest in search of the beast all turned out to be rubbish. The ending of the book in my opinion was a rushing finish so I had no chance to enjoy it. I would recommend this book to all because it was touching in away and to all the kids it would be fun to have a shelter on a deserted island with no parents.	2003-09-25

The downward spiral they go into is gradual and frightening to behold. Certain children are representative of adult personalities found in the real world.<br />You have Ralph, the moral compass. It can be argued that he was the only one on the island to hold  true to what he believed in without fail. A natural leader, Ralph is chosen as chief by the other children at the beginning of the novel.<br />Piggy is an ignored conscience. He says logical things that would help the group, but is made fun of because of his annoyingly nerdy, fat appearance. A lot of people probably know people like this.<br />Jack is another leader. But unlike Ralph, he rebels and does what he wants. The other children see things in Jack that they inheritanly think is cool and want to emulate.<br />When Jack becomes fed up with piggy and Ralph's logic, he starts a new camp. Eventually everyone but Ralph and Piggy are in Jack's group.<br />Jack's clan becomes caught up in the idea of a 'beast.' The thing that does not exist exists in the minds of the children as an unseen evil that will attack at any time. The beast is the one driving force that keeps Jack and his group going, and it is enough to cloud there judgement, eventually driving them to kill.<br />Ralph and Piggy hold strong while everything goes wrong. Jack and his group ignore their mistakes and pretend like nothing happened. Jack makes things up and his clan automatically excepts it as truth.<br />The last moment of the book is a powerful climax. Jack and the childrens' primal savagry comes to a head as they chase Ralph through the forest. They have let go of all hopes and truths that the outside world contains. The fire on the island reflects off their eyes. But when they witness a rescue soldier dressed in uniform, everything that had built up inside them collapses. The fire leaves their eyes and they seem to immediately forget all the things that were important to them on the island. Ralph is the only one that seems to understand that finally it is over, and that he alone did not falter.<br />This book has a great theme and a wonderfully frightening atmosphere.

I believe that the actual story that \\"Lord of the Flies\\" gives it's readers more than one can see at first glance.

It takes the cliched story of a plane wrecked group on a remote island and turns it into a thought provoking story of morals and reality.  It starts with a plane crash on a remote island in which all of the children, which are boys from English Military Schools, live and (of coarse) al lof the adults die.  Which creates a problem within an even bigger problem.  The boys now have to to create a way to live on this island without the help and supervision of adults.<br />So we start the book with Ralph and Piggy finding the conch, a symbolic shell that they use to summon the other boys and as a moderater.  So they summon the other boys and they create their own rules and they vote Ralph as the leader.  They decide that their only hope in being rescued is if they make a fire and a passing ship sees the smoke.  Early on they realize that they need to create a form of life just as the adults would.<br />But they aren't so lucky.  As you would expect there are people who want to just have fun and go against Ralph.  And the boy who sparks all of this is Jack.  Throughout he is striving to become the leader.  He is feels that hunting and getting meat is the number one priority.  On the other hand Piggy and Ralph know that being rescued and staying together is the main priority.  This of coarse caused Ralph to fude with Jack.  This part of the book is the part that causes the whole thing to fall apart. I think that thisa is one of the things in the book that keeps me wanting to read it.  It creates a real competitive feel to it and it makes you wonder when their angry climax.<br />One of the events that causes a separation between Ralphs group and Jack's group is the time when Jack and his hunters are supposed to be watching the fire but they decide to go hunting instead.  The fire goes out and of coarse right at that moment a ship goes by.  Ralph naturally atacks Jack and causes them to become rivals to a greater extent.<br />There are parts that make this book out to be a savage murderous tale.  Two of the boys Piggy and Simon get murdered by the other boys.  SImon in a accident where the boys get scared and think he is the beast.  And Piggy is murdered when some of the boys get angry with him and drop a rock on his head.  Although these deaths areunexpected they are needed to create the whole thing to just feel more crazy and makes you think afterwards about how their families will feel when they find out their children got killed but all the others lived.<br />But i think that the major flaw in this book for me was the ending.  It ended with the boys all running after Ralph trying to kill him and then being saved.  I agree that it causes you to think at the end of the book about what will happen.  But i think that it should have either told more of what happened when they got back or they shouldn't have been rescued.  i agree though that it did leave you thinking which gives you a chance to create your own thoguht on it.<br />This book makes you think about all of the things that you would be forced to give up if you were in there situation.

There were a few times when i got really into the book, but a lot of points where i found myself dozing off or just not paying attention to a single word i read on the page.<br />  I really liked the begging of the book. It seemed like this could have possibly happen. The kids on the island formed a small society and create a form of government and a system like I believe anyone stranded on the island would be.<br />  As the book progressed i became more and more less interested in the book. The author wrote a lot of the same ideas over and over like jacks going on and on about hunting. GET THE IDEA, CAN WE GET ON WITH THE REST OF THE STORY!<br />  After a while i lost the sense of the characters actions being realistic. Jack forms a tribe that splits off of the rest of the kids. His tribe seems to be based on hunting and spilling blood. They start singing &quot;KILL THE BEAST! CUT HIS THROAT! SPILL HIS BLOOD!&quot; Which is the most random thing i can ever imagine anyone doing.<br />  Golding in my mind never actually explains how the kids survive. The kids just live you don't really hear about how they find the fruit or the water. None of the kids ever complains (except about mean over and over...) about things like sunburns or lack of food being cold, things you would expect from a bunch of young kids trapped on a tropical island in the middle of nowhere.<br />  Even though Golding does not address the main points in my mind, the points he does address he does very well. Ralph has a strong will to get rescued and him and piggy seem to be the only ones that are actually trying to get rescued. But Golding creates this beast that started out as just a nightmare into the kids killing each other because they are so paranoid. I wonder how the kids ever became so violent and bloodthirsty.<br />  All in all i didn't like the book. But for people who like a very fantastic and random story in no way could be true; you might like it. If you are looking to read a serious book about survival in the wild i suggest hatchet which is very good in describing the way a boy learns to live (emphasis on the learns). He does not just run around and kill things like the kids in LOTF.tastic and random story in no way could be true; you might like it.

Ralph seems to the others to be a constricting adult. He pressures them to work and collect fruit tend to the fire instead of running around and playing games on the beach or hunting pigs to eat. Jack is the solution to this he offers a separate tribe to join instead. They paint their faces hide in wait of pigs and develop strategies to track them down. Eventually tempted by the new power most of the boys move over to jacks tribe because they are sick of work and want meat instead of fruit to eat. When there are only a few left with Ralph. Ralph and piggy try to confront the lack of interest in getting rescued also piggy needs his glasses back. There is a scene where piggy gets a rock dropped on him and Ralph fights with jack. As a spear glances off his side Ralph turns and runs to hide in a thick thorn bush the next day when they hunt him. His friends who were forced into the other tribe betray him and before he can be smoked out, he breaks their ranks. Later he hides under another bush in a shadow but Rodger finds him. As they chase Ralph shelters are bursting into flame.<br />The ending leaves you hanging you don't really know what is going to happen I didn't really like that though you do get to just make it up yourself.

William Golding really did do an incredible job of linking every vague detail in his book to the ideas he had about human nature, and the post world war II world in symbolistic forms (The Conch, The Glasses, The Beast). Still, finishing the book leaves one with a rather bitter taste in their mouth. I feel that the extraneous amounts of unnecessary violence Golding included, and the extreme behavior of the characters as the story progressed really kept me from appreciating the true artistic essence, and incredible emotion of this book.<br /> The story itself begins with a group of young military-school boys (who are assumed to have suffered a plane crash over the ocean water) landing on a small, uninhabited tropical island. Ralph, the main character, quickly steps up to leading the group, and gets the boys on track to getting rescued. He has them start a signal fire; make shelters, and just generally keeps them in a microcosmic society of the world they once knew.<br /> The society quickly breaks down though. Jack (a boy jealous of Ralph's leadership) is overcome by his urge to hunt wild pigs and have fun, and finally leaves the group over a conflict of interest about the signal fire. Gradually everyone who once followed Ralph leave him to join Jack's primordial savage hunting tribe, where they hunt wild pigs and savagely kill them. This in itself is graphically documented throughout the book, and the boys' morals are gradually replaced with more primitive instinct and reasoning.<br /> Before you know it, a book that started out fairly boringly is filled with rotting severed pig's heads on sticks talking to characters in the book (in their head, showing their mental stability starting to depart from them, but somewhat disturbing none the less), and Jack's tribe savagely killing some of the boys that didn't join them, for unclear reasons (being overcome by their lust for violence, rebellion from sane society, call it what you will). There is a sporadic parallel story going on, about a \\"Beast,\\" which is nothing more than the boys' respective manifestations of their worst fears (and perhaps the fear of the consequences of their actions catching up with them), and this fear feeds Jack's tribe's ruthlessness towards the end of the book. Quite predictably, the book ends with the boys being rescued, but not before Jack and his tribe almost murders Ralph.<br /> I really wish I could have appreciated this book more, but frankly the writer's negative view of the world (which was in turn reflected in his writing) was a little too depressing to be enjoyable. I do recommend the book as a good read at least once, and it is without a doubt a classic work of literature, but when it all comes down to it...

It is full of symbolism and it has been said to be many things, such as allegories on things as varied as Christianity to Psychology.

Another problem that i found within this book was the sheer number of unimportant characters the continually are mentioned. Characters with no background or character development are often named, making me feel as though i missed something, again taking me off track of my reading. Overall the story itself has an interesting idea, in my opinion, this interesting story is quite frankly ruined by the poor quality of Golding's writing.

Golding achieves high<br />drama throughout most of the work as the audience wonders<br />whether or not the group of stranded boys will come to their<br />collective senses. The setting is an island semi-paradise<br />where a group of boys are stranded temporarily. As time<br />progresses and no-one seems to notice them, a restlessness<br />takes over. Before long, the boys begin turning their<br />attention to the leader of the pack and his friend &quot;Piggy&quot;.<br />The book depicts some of the worst human emotions of<br />children . It progresses from an understandable<br />restlessness to progressive violence and ultimately murder.<br />This is a good rendition of group dynamics including<br />leadership, role-playing, group cohesiveness, the breakdown<br />of group cohesiveness and the complex dynamic<br />involving rewards and punishments in the pursuit of<br />group goals.<br />The work depicts both the positive side and negative side<br />of group conflict. Its positive side is constructive<br />argument leading to a successful resolution of a problem.<br />The negative side is violence in the pursuit of group<br />survival goals. In the instant case, the violence is directed<br />toward &quot;Piggy&quot; whose pleadings to move the group toward<br />constructive conflict resolution are ignored. Ultimately,<br />the group embraces &quot;the herd mentality&quot; until the consequences<br />of its murderous actions are irreversible. The chaos<br />seems to halt when an authority figure steps off a search<br />boat and views the scene for the first time. There are<br />many lessons to be learned from this work. These range from<br />group cooperation to the negative impact of group deviancy<br />from normal modes of civil conduct. The work is appropriate for<br />young teenagers, persons studying group dynamics and others<br />interested in quality English literature. The work is well<br />written. The sentence construction is good for a book depicting<br />small talk between and amongst typical teenage boys in middle<br />school. The work shows how groups deteriorate into destructive<br />behavioral modes when logical problem resolution fails to<br />produce generally acceptable alternatives.<br />A typical assignment might be to read this book and have<br />the class critique it in small groups of 4-5 students.<br />Participants could discuss control points surrounding the<br />breakdown of order, as well as alternative negotiation<br />strategies aimed at enhancing group cooperation/cohesion.ion is good for a book depicting<br />small talk between and amongst typical teenage boys in middle<br />school.

And each time it offers new meanings and insights.  Part of its charm derives from the fact that it can be appreciated on so many different levels, however hackneyed it may be to suggest so.  It can be read through and enjoyed as an adventure story, full of drama and suspense.  But, of course, it is much, much more, and this is why it is such a wonderful piece of literature.<br />Lord of the Flies is best known, probably, for its symbolism, and as one critic has opined, it is a symbolism that works.  Each element, each symbol, operates individually, independently, but also interlocks with everything else in the book--not simply the other symbols but also the characters, the setting, the theme--from which it draws its deepest meaning.  The conch, the platform, Piggys specs, the pigs head, the island itself--they all fit beautifully and memorably together, along with Goldings stunning descriptions of places, characters, and events, to create the picture of a society corrupted by flaws in its constitutive human beings.  It richly deserves its reputation as a classic.	2003-07-21

I'm normally one who steers away from literature in the 'classics' section at Borders, as it gives me memories of bad books that we've all been forced to read in high school (then again, maybe I'm just to young too appreciate The Awakening or Mainstreet... ) I just happened to randomly pick this book off the shelf and start reading while I was waiting for a friend to find something. By the time she came back, I was so engaged in the first chapter that I bought it. I enjoyed it...it's the type of book that you can ponder about afterwards and it's not a boring read (*cough*Lord of the Rings*cough*). In fact, I ALMOST enjoyed writing a paper about it senior year!  If you'd like to read something unique, disturbing, and thought provoking, then this something you should read.	2003-07-21

If my mind were erased and I could only keep one memory it would be the lessons taught by this book. Golding wrote a masterpiece. I was forced to read this book 2 years ago when I was in 10th grade. Being the highschool slacker that I was I kept to my sparknotes. One night I actually got the responsibilty to pick up the book and start reading it. I finished it that night, I could not put it down. I researched all the symbolism in that book. Now every essay I write I use Lord of the Flies. This book is incredible. I urge everyone to not only read it, but study it. This book is so powerful it turned a highschool slacker into a English major!	2003-07-21
US	37628361	ROV33EES9A31R	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	3	0	1	N	N	A pretty good book	I read Lord of the Flies knowing it's a classic and for the most part I thought it was pretty good. It details the story of young boys stranded on an island after a plane crash. At first, the primary character of the novel, Ralph, heads the dictatorship that begins, but as time passes, Ralph comes to blow with Jack. Where Ralph sees the boys' primary concern being signaling a passing ship for help, Jack is concerned with hunting. So, two groups emerge with Ralph and Jack as the leaders. After that, some very dramatic and interesting happenings take place as the reader sees savagery and visciousness develop amongst the boys.<br />The only real problem I had with the story was the lack of explanation about the boys. The novel starts after the plane crash has taken place and the author never offers an explanation for who these boys are or where they were going. Also, I found it somewhat unrealistic the way in which the boys seemed to get along so well on their own. They didn't seem nearly as frightened as I'd imagine boys would be in their place in reality.<br />Overall, I say this book is worth reading if you're interested. It's not too long and has a pretty good story.	2003-06-29

Needless to say, Mr. Golding has a very negative view of people.  Perhaps his view is colored by the fact that he lived through the development and dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan (atomic bombs are brought up in the book as having hit the airport from where the boy's plane departed) and the rise of Nazism in Germany.  Mr. Golding uses a group of plane wreaked boys to tell his tale of what he thinks is the natural denigration of society.  Still, I can't find his view at all consistent with the world around us.  If savagery was natural for people we would not have developed into a civilized society.  In fact, with few exceptions, all peoples form structured societies that impart rules for the welfare of the group; not the other way around as Mr. Golding would have us believe.  Except for few notable exceptions (like Nazi Germany) savagery is not natural for people.  Even there, civilized peoples prevailed.  Additionally, I believe this book has racist overtones in that Mr. Golding chooses to use the jungle motif to display his version of savagery.  Why couldn't he use another back drop?<br />Technically good writing gets the book three stars.	2003-06-25
US	29565451	R1ILCX4CTDIP8N	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	2	0	0	N	N	not what I expected	The Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, takes place on an island with no adult supervision. Stuck on this island is a group of boys; most of them turn to hunting and killing (This group is led by Jack Merridew), and the two others (named Piggy and Ralph) stick to rules and trying to be rescued. Essentially, this quote: \\"Which is better- to have rules and agree, or to hunt and kill?\\" (164) covers the theme of this book. I have mixed feelings about this book. On one hand, the ending and theme of this book leave the reader thinking. On the other hand, the majority of the book is not very exciting.<br /> The theme and ending of the Lord of the Flies were what kept my interest. The quote: \\"Which is better- to have rules and agree, or to hunt and kill?\\" is one that cannot be answered easily. It was very interesting how the boys dealt with the question, and how most of them leaned toward the hunting and killing aspect of survival.<br /> However, despite the fact that the idea of the book is interesting, it is very slow moving. There is a lot of description of events, which makes the book uninteresting. One example is when they are describing what will happen with the fire which they keep going to catch the eye of a ship that could rescue them. There is a lot of dialogue and description that could be done without. For example, when Piggy and Ralph find out that Jack let the fire go out, there are two pages of description of their reaction.<br /> Some of the characters are also underdeveloped. One character, Simon, plays an important role in the book, yet he only appears a few times. He is the one who discovers the Lord of the Flies. Still, he is barely described, and the reader does not get a good enough sense of his personality. This lack of description also makes the reader care less about these characters, so, the scenes that they're in seem less important. I even had to re-read the part about the Lord of the Flies, because since I didn't think Simon was very important, I didn't pay too much attention to that scene.<br /> Additionally, the book skips around. Simon, for example, leaves the group to search for the beast (which is the Lord of the Flies). It goes back and forth between Simon and the Lord of the Flies interacting, and the rest of the boys discussing what to do with the conch. This takes emphasis off of this important part, and it is also confusing. I had to re-read a few parts.<br /> The end of the book was sort of worth wile. It was simply a nice ending, and nice is exactly the word that explains it; it wasn't exciting, happy, sad, etc., just plain nice. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy symbolism, detail, and adventure stories. I would not recommend this to someone who is looking for some leisure reading. It is fairly complicated, and un-exciting. I chose to read this book because I heard that it was an outstanding classic. However, after reading it, I have found otherwise.didn't pay too much attention to that scene.  <BR> Additionally, the book skips around.

Golding uses English school boys stranded on a remote desert isle for his study of society.  At first, the boys agree to work together with Ralph trying to maintain order by assigning various chores such as food gathering and keeping a signal fire for search and rescue attempts.  Not long afterward, Jack challenges Ralph and lures the boys away to live like savages hunting wild pigs and running around in paint.  As jack gains power among the boys, Ralph finds himself suddenly being hunted by his former friends.<br />Lord of the Flies is an intense look at larger society if the norms are ever overturned.  At first it is fun acting any way one wants when there are no adults to oversee.  However, the mundane chores stop being done and order breaks down.  The young children that were being looked after, just disappear without reason and nobody seems to mind or notice.  The savage group reacts alomost with casual abandon when one of the group is accidentally killed by the rest.  When order is tried to be reinstated, chaos reacts swiftly and harshly. Lord of the Flies is both a great read and a very important book.	2003-06-11

The whole adventure comes to an end when the boys are rescued by a Britsh navy ship.<br />Golding has created one of the classic books of modern literature. His characters are sharp and very well done. His descriptions of the boys and island are well done as well. His story-telling is tight and he never looses the thread of his story amongst all of his symbolism. Symbolism is what truly separates Golding's work from other novels.

Piggy represents the superego and his glasses, or specs, intellectual thought.

William Golding seems to have the answer.  In this novel, The Lord of the Flies, we enter the a world of darkness and violence.  All spawned out of the hearts of very young men.<br />The bible says, \\"There in no one who does good, no not one.\\"<br />And, \\"All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.\\"<br />The hard fact of the matter is that man's natural bent is turned in toward himself.<br />This self centeredness is a mild transgression...that creates all kinds of deeper more insidious types of evil in the hearts of men.  What is stealing, but the selfish desire to possess something we can't buy?  What is jealousy, but the selfish desire to be better than someone else?  What is murder, but the selfish want to supercede someone else and take their place in the world from them?  All of these evil desire spawn out of a natural inclination toward selfishness.<br />In the Lord of the Flies we see the way in which a \\"normal\\" human being spirals quickly down into a life of total depravity.  The \\"feel good\\" sociologists and psychologists will try to convince you that man is born basically good.  But if you look at the actions of man and novels such as Golding's you will clearly see that man has the capability and natural inclination to turn utterly savage in a heartbeat.<br />In this compelling story we meet a group of school boys stranded on a remote desert island.  The boys work cooperatively for a time.  Soon the trappings of society and order break down.  The boy's rudimentary attempt at establishing a government crumbles and is rabidly devoured by the voracious appetite of self centeredness.<br />There are two main power centers in this book:<br />* Ralph/Piggy- who try to run a civilized society ruled by common sense and order.<br />* Jack-  the leader of a group of hunters who are ruled by sensual desires and to satify their basest needs.<br />These two power centers clash brutally just like we do in our own minds, when we battle to keep down our strange desires.  Like the concience battling the selish nature.  Ralph/Piggy are a civilized concience trying to keep things orderly and good.  While Jack and his hunters are untamed desire, ruled by their stomach and lust for violence.<br />The hunters quickly decide to battle with the idea of organized society.  They soon splinter off into a tribe ruled by the concept of \\"might makes right.\\"  Ralph and Piggy try to hold onto the frayed edges of society and order only to be sucked into the endless void violence and uncontrolled selfishness.<br />This book is timeless.  You can easily apply it's message and themes throughout your life and experience.  It  plays out true everytime.

What if you and your friends had to live alone on this island while still maintaining order and a way of having the basic necessities.  Well this is what Ralph, Jack, Simon, Piggy and all their friends have encountered in Lord of the Flies by William Golding.<br /> In Lord of the Flies a group of friends organize a tribe on the deserted island and live their lives to the fullest in order to survive.  One boy Ralph was appointed the leader while they have Jack as the head of the hunters and Simon as the head of the explorers.  In the time of their stay on the island they hunt wild pigs, play games, go for swims in the lagoon, and try to keep their spirits up.  While they are there they always kept a signal fire going in hope to be rescued.  After many weeks on the island problems start brewing and feuds between boys come into play, which cause diversities.<br /> One event in the book is when one of the boys Simon goes to investigate something that all the boys thought to be a monster, which Simon discovers is really not.  When Simon comes to tell the other boys they attack him and kill him because they thought he was the monster emerging form the jungle.<br /> This book was very interesting and kept a good pace.  It was very fun to read and imagine all your friends living alone without any adult supervision.  It is a great book to read for people who like to read adventure books.  I would highly recommend this book.	2003-05-22

It takes an amazing look at humanity, and our cruel primal nature.  Anyone would start to turn on their friends after being stuck on an island, especially when everyone is fighting for power and leadership!  That is the way of nature.<br />Humans may be the &quot;superior being&quot;, but we are all animals inside.  We all have the primal feelings, and once we are taken out of civilized culture, our true nature begins to shine through.  That is exactly what Golding explains and symbolizes in this breath-taking story.<br />Anyone who gave this a bad review either does not comprehend the story and situation, or they are to wrapped up in the idea that humans are \\"too good\\" to turn cannibalistic or become murderers.  Young BOYS, especially, have a certain \\"macho\\" aura, and they all have the obsessive need of being a leader.

US	32173144	R14TFBT2BSDGNH	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	2	0	3	N	N	LotF Review	The Lord of the Flies is about an airplane, which crashes on an island, and a group of kids are trapped there.  The book is about their time spent on the island.  The main characters are Ralph, Piggy, Jack and Simon.  As soon as they crash on the island, they start having many problems.  At first everyone is good and picks Ralph as chief.  Then things slowly start to turn bad when Jack and his hunters let the fire out and a ship went by without seeing the smoke.  Jack takes everyone but Piggy, Ralph, Simon and some little ones and goes to the other side of the island and makes his own tribe.  My favorite character is Ralph because he seems to be the only smart one with some kind of authority on the island.  He is the only adult like figure on the island.<br />Ralph shows the kind of person that will see a problem and try to fix it the right way.  Jack sees a problem as an opportunity to take control and start running everything and making the problem worse at the same time.  I see this everyday, even when I am in class.  You have your kids that are like Jack and want to give the teacher and everyone else a hard time.  Then you have people like Ralph.  The person in class that sits there and does the work because they know that making things harder for the teacher, will only make things harder for them.  I'm like two in one because if I see a chance to make a good joke, I make it.  Otherwise I keep my mouth closed.<br />I thought the book was kind of confusing because the author jumped around a lot.  And didn't explain things as well as he should.  The book went a little slow too.  My favorite part in the book is at the end when the navy officer is standing there talking to Ralph.  It's a flash back to real life.  The only thing I would change in the book is the lack of information.<br />This book is easy to get into in the beginning, but then slows down during the end.  I spent a lot of time rereading parts in the book.  The only people I think would like this is a younger kid because they don't care about understanding it or an older person because they have the knowledge to understand what is happening.r kid because they don't care about understanding it or an older person because they have the knowledge to understand what is happening.	2003-05-14

Golding, although it is apparent that he really hates humanity and is a bitter man, is such a wonderful writer and makes this story come to life in more than one way.

His symbols are also one thing that show us what human nature is really about and how it actually is.<br />This book is about a group of choir boys that get stranded on an island during a war.

Some of the boys take charge and their names are Ralph, Piggy, and Jack. They all go to the top of a mountain and light a fire so boats will see them. Later the boys do different things some go hunting, others play on the beach, and two are left building shelters, and one is Ralph. The boys think there is a beast which is proven to the boys when two see something on top of the mountain that moves. They slowly grow to be more and more savage and even leave pigs heads for the beast. Something bad happens one day and the boys split up into a group of savages and one of boys who are normal. They fight over things the four in the normal group go to the savages. One is left after a capture and a hunt is made for him.<br />Some things I liked about the book are how the events are realistic like how the boys grew to be savages. I also liked how some things that happen just appear there unexplained but are easy to guess how they happened. In some parts something that seems like it doesn't even matter and were just added for no reason changed what happened for everyone. I didn't like how some parts were very insightful but not explained so I had to guess and one character is meant to be religious but it is like things that happen in the bible are related to what happens to him.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who likes books with a lot of twists and surprises. Although I would not recommend this to anyone who strongly thinks that the human heart is completely pure and no one could do anything bad to anyone else or be savage.	2003-05-10

In this literary masterpiece, Golding takes an imaginative look at the life of young boys in an extraordinary situation: without rules, boundaries, or a defined social system. His boundless sense of imagination, and his unparalleled creativity allow him to form a lifelike environment in which the reader can capture a sense of reality on such a seemingly bazaar topic. Set on a small deserted tropical island, thickly wooded by rain a forest, and a harsh jungle, the boys often have trouble in their fight for survival. One may ask... How did the boys find themselves on this island?<br />During a nuclear war, at an unspecified time in future, a plane carrying British schoolboys crash-landed, the boys found themselves alone and helpless. Golding did not set a specific time period in which the story takes place. By doing this, he allows us, the reader, to put the story in the time we desire - making it more enjoyable to its variety of readers. The boys had crash-landed on their new home; and few other people would ever believe the story of this place should the boys ever return to Britain one day to tell it. The perseverance, and leadership of a few twelve year olds, kept the majority of the six to twelve year old bys occupied and leading productive lives away from the civilization they were accustom to. William Golding tells the story of the boy's interminable stay on this otherwise - despondent piece of rock. Golding stresses their trials and tribulations on this undiscovered place, and how boys become savages when culture and pressure are not present in someone's life. The boys' primitive instincts reared their ugly heads while they were living on the island - they had never lived in such a way ever before. .<br />The novel begins with two boys, Ralph and \\"Piggy\\", who at first are alone - no other boys are present. They are looking at the destruction of the jungle caused by the rough descent of their plane. Eventually the boys begin to congregate. Showing a great sense of maturity, Ralph takes charge - and assesses their situation. The boys range from six to twelve years old, and at first it seems like there is no way to keep order. Ralph decides that they are going to run their island as a democracy - the boys vote to keep Ralph as their leader, though many of the boys stay loyal to Jack. A few of the biguns (or older boys) were fighting for control of the island. Jack, another boy of twelve, rivals Ralph for leadership throughout the novel - Jack quickly becomes the leader of the hunters. Previously, a group of choirboys, the hunters became a savage faction. They collected pigs and other forms of meat for the boys to eat in addition to their regular diets of berries.<br />Ralph, despite Jacks competition, was able to maintain control of most of the boys for the better part of the story. His own minor digressions into savagery however, put his leadership into question - and Jack eventually took control of the island. Golding's last fifty pages, depict an island in utter chaos. His satiristic attitude of the adult world, mock the political and militaristic disputes in our world now. He shows how a small group of boys can sum up our entire society with both political rivalries, and groups battling each other for control. Lord of the Flies is a great novel!

The story takes place in the future at the outbreak World War III, which the author predicts will occur.  The first page of the novel describes two of the main characters, Ralph and Piggy, exploring a jungle on the island where they had just crash-landed, discussing their plane crash.  Ralph, Piggy, and a plane full of other children are headed to an orphanage-like facility when their jet goes down on an uninhabited, tropical island.  For the rest of the novel, the fate of the surviving boys will become the authors main focus.<br />Ralph and Piggy gather the boys on the island.  Ralph, being a natural leader, creates basic rules for the children to follow and a strategy for survival and rescue.  Immediately, one of the older boys, Jack, is highly confrontational with Ralph and his authority.  Ralphs main priority as chosen leader is to build a signal fire that will continuously produce smoke in order to get the attention of passing ships.  Ralph and Piggy do their best to maintain order, law, and a functioning community.  Jack and many others no longer wish to be part of Ralphs tribe, with all of the rules, jobs, and responsibilities.  Jack becomes chief of this own tribe and incessantly harasses Ralph.  The two warring clans are forced to deal with one another and well as a mysterious beast that lives on top of the islands mountain.  Throughout the book, all of the characters face both external and internal conflicts.<br />In the first chapter of Lord of the Flies the setting of the story is meticulously described.  While reading Goldings portrayal of the islands climate, I almost felt sweaty and fearful of poisonous jungle creatures.  Golding is an expert in the art of showing the idea he is expressing, not literally telling the reader.<br />[The boy with fair hair] had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead.  All round himthe jungle was a bath of heat.  He was clambering heavily around the creepers and broken trunks (page 7).<br />I extremely enjoyed reading this novel.  It is psychologically fascinating, providing a rarely discussed insight to the savagery of the human mind.  This is not a light read; rather it is a book to seriously read two or more times in order to fully appreciate it.<br />There is a clear connection between Lord of the Flies past and current tribal warfare, political factions, even the business world.  Another similarity between this book and reality can be found in adolescent social situations.  In many schools several group leaders emerge and compete for students to follow them.  When this struggle occurs in schools, it is of course not as violent or blatantly aggressive.  It also does not result in deaths, with the exception of a few rare occasions.<br />William Goldings Lord of the Flies is timeless and a tremendous read.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the human mind, or is just looking for a book that stays with you long after you have put the novel down.trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead.

Like the biblical Eden, man is once again shown to be imperfect and filled with original sin.  The boys live on an island where it seems they have no worries.  Fruit is available in plenty.  The weather is great.  There are no predators except themselves. Their fall from grace then comes when all this is shown to be not enough for them, and they kill a mother pig for meat.  There is no god, or devil on this island however, only man.  Ralph represents the good in man.  The descriptions of him are even godlike or golden, but Ralph is just a man (or boy).  Jack is described as the devil, but once again he is just a depiction of the worst of what is in man.  Simon and Piggy who represents man's wisdom fall in-between these other two individuals representing man himself, and both are flawed and killed.  The \\"Beast\\" which the children are afraid of first takes on the form of a serpent or snake and later the form of a \\"Great Ape\\" up on the mountain, but in each case the real danger comes from within however, as man is the one shown to have a heart of darkness.  When Simon talks to the \\"Lord of the Flies\\" it is all explained.  \\"Fancy thinking the beast was something you could hunt and kill!\\", \\"You knew didn't you?  I'm part of you?  Close, close, close!\\".  They can't hunt and kill the beast because they are the beast.  There is also no salvation.  When the children ask for a savior, or sign, what they are given was a dead Man (paratrooper).  It is all man.  This is not a book of hope.  Even in the end when the children are rescued there is still no hope, as the naval officer who rescues them is still just part of a greater war between men, and the Garden of Eden they leave behind has been turned into their own hell filled with fire.  I believe William Golding uses a lot of psychology in this book and each image takes on a deeper meaning.  It is not known how long the children are on the island, so it seems kind of timeless.  The number of children is also vague, which I think is deliberate.  They are also at times faceless children.  I thought it was wonderfully written and deserves to be listed as one of the best books ever written.  Even if it is a little depressing, it made me think.I believe William Golding uses a lot of psychology in this book and each image takes on a deeper meaning.

With all due respect, Golding couldn't write a good book to save his life. His writing is reminiscent of Tolkien's; he comes up with a great story, and then ruins it with horrible writing. But I suppose I should stop ranting about the book and get on to a summary.<br /> A relatively large group of young boys are marooned on an island. One young boy, Ralph, decides he's the leader because has in his possession a conch shell, which most SpongeBob fans will recognize from one of the episodes. In his \\"Inner Circle,\\" there are some other boys: Piggy, an unpleasantly fat asthmatic intellectual; Samaneric, two twins who individually are Sam and Eric, and the \\"littleuns,\\" some of the youngest boys who can't get it through their thick skulls that they're lost on a deserted island. Ralph is encountering problems with Jack, the leader of the boy's choir, who has a rebellious soul. Without spoiling too much of the story, Jack gets mad, runs off with most of the boys, and several other events that fail to stimulate the brain. In the end, they are all rescued by the Royal Navy, (they're British,) and they all live happily ever after, minus a pudgy pain-in-the-rear. If you ask me, I would have been a bit more pleased if they all died.<br /> This summary may sound choppy and rushed, because the book is choppy and rushed. The author had several chances to redeem himself, but why only put the book's namesake in a one-and-a-half page segment of the book that has no symbolism, real or otherwise. When you look back at the story, you may think, \\"Wow, that sounds really cool!\\" And the story is, but it makes no sense, and the parts that do are just plain dull. In the hands of a good author, namely Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, and especially Orson Scott Card, this book may have been one of my all time favorites. Goodkind and Card would have turned the book into an action-packed book with beautiful internal conflicts, and Jordan would describe the island with such vivid detail I would feel like I wanted to get lost on an island myself. However, as it is, I'm now terminally afraid of anything surrounded by water on all sides.<br /> The point I'm trying to get around here is this: Great story, God-awful writing. I'd only give this book a one out of ten, the one only for story. In a videogame, even if the game isn't too pretty, if it has a great core, it's a wonderful experience. With books, however, that's just not true.h such vivid detail I would feel like I wanted to get lost on an island myself.

This book follows the day to day life on the island, cooking, hunting, and the desperate struggle to keep their smoke signal going.  However, as civilized as these children appear at the start of the book, the call of their savage, human, inner soul is too strong for them, and the instinct to survive forces them to undergo a a shocking and terrible change.  The book, using dramatic imagery and a disturbing plot drew me into its fast paced world, where  I discovered shocking and horrifying secrets about the human spirit let loose.  The book was severely disquieting, yet its strong and bewitching plot made me read on.

Not only did it have one of the best story lines a book could have; it also delivered a very important message pertaining to rules and anarchy.  The book was about a group of young boys who's plane crashed on an island.  There are no adult survivors and the kids are left to fend for themselves.  Some of the boys that are on the island are Ralph, Jack, Piggy, and Simon.  Ralph is kind of the leader of the boys in the beginning.  He is later left alone with piggy, a rotund boy whose glasses play a very important role in the book.  Jack is one of the meanest boys on the island.  He is the leader of the choirboys, which later become the hunters.  He is the one who later takes control of the group and moves them to the other side of the island and attacks Jack and Piggy.  Simon is the one who discovers the Lord of the Flies.  He also represents pureness among the boys.  The book is about how a world without rules would only result in chaos and anarchy.  At first the boys still acted civilized and respectful, but when the boys slowly broke away from the rules, their world descended into a world of madness.  There are a lot of twists and turns in this book.  You will never know what will happen next.  I would recommend this book to anybody that wants to dive into a world without rules.  It is a good source to show all of us just how important rules can be to us and that in order to maintain civilization; we must uphold these rules.  This is a definite must read for all ages.	2003-04-09

While it's certainly true that the greatest literature has a timelessness that lends itself to reinterpretation by subsequent generations, is this story of a group of boys who as Stephen King put it &quot;just went a little too far&quot; really in that category?  In my opinion, absolutely.<br />Set sometime in the near future during an unspecified world war, the story concerns the fate of a collection of boys stranded on a tropical island paradise after the plane evacuating them from the war zone crashes.  All adults are dead and there is no way to make contact with the outside world.  In short the boys are thrown back on to their own resources and forced to re-create the society that they knew.  At first things go well &quot;after all we're not savages&quot;, but as tensions tear the group apart and fear and superstition reshape the boys world, we are confronted with the stark reality of just how fragile the structures of our own society which we have come to think of as indomitable actually are.<br /><br />Many feel that Golding was too pessimistic in his assessment that man is inherently bound to society and without day to day constraints imposed on us by the culture we live in we would more likely than not revert to nothing more than &quot;painted savages&quot;. But I feel that the power of the book derives from its fundamental truth, the darkness that dwells in the pit of the human heart is at times all to hideously evident and that's what makes \\"The Lord of the Flies\\" so brilliant and so frightening.	2003-04-08

I thought that the way the boys adopted to their surroundings was phenomenal. If i could symbolize this book in one line i would say that when it comes down to it every living organism on earth is interested in one thing and one thing only, its own survival.<br />I thought that a little bit of it may have been extreme with the killing of eachother and everything but i think that being on that island long enough might have driven people to do things like that.<br />One thing that i realized in the book was that you never actually find out where the island that they are on is located. My theory to why you never actually get to see this information is because William Golding was actually trying not to pay to much attention to detail because this story was about something as general as human nature.<br />I think that the contrast and conflict between the characters is so intriguing and the transformation of these characters throughout the story from nice english boys to nasty savages is completely fascinating.<br />I think another theme that i can derive from this book is survival of the fittest. This is Darwins theory at its best it is the show survivor but with no cameras and real danger. Instead of getting voted off you really die.<br />I also think that even though it seems like a lot of the boys are against eachother that they could not have survived without eachother. Even though it seems like Jack was made for this stuff if he was put there alone instead of being almost excited about being a leader he would be in a state of panic and i dont think he would last too long.<br />Overall i thought that this book was very intriguing and it is a good look at what is going on in the brain of a man who knows a huga amoung about human nature.	2003-04-04

I believe in this novel, like others I have read published in this period, has a slow paced plot that does not have incredible amounts of action.  In this book, it is sometimes necessary to read two chapters before something exciting accure.  For this reason I feel the book may leave something to be desired among the new generation of readers.  However, I feel that William Golding does a great job of creating the beautiful, yet traitorous terrain and characters on the island.  Overall, this book deserves its crown as one of the best books of its type in the 20th Century.	2003-04-02
US	39366896	R2A6XWZOQQ3V8I	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	5	1	2	N	N	Leaves an indelible impression	Having not been assigned to read this powerful and provocative work in high school or college, I decided to see what all the fuss was about, so to speak.  Although short and compact in size, Lord of the Flies proves to be anything but that in breadth and depth.  Nothing short of incredible, Golding's novella examines human nature and its internal and external variables that wield it into shape.  An allegory no less, the pages of Lord of the Flies nonetheless come alive as they provocatively bring the reader into a paradoxical world of bestial Darwinian survival of the fittest versus rational deductional logic and care for one's fellow man.<br />Unlike The Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies asserts that human nature is inherently evil - not corrupted by external forces, but rather an intrinsic trait to be overcome.  Our innocence is not lost by some terrible experience, because conversely we have never had it.  While evil exists in all of us, Golding says, we must conquer it and make a decision based on logic and sound reasoning to consciously reject it, and, in turn, not revert to barbarous savagery.  We, as individuals, must cognizantly and wisely choose the righteous, yet discerning path of Ralph, as opposed to the malevolent and malicious evil one of Jack, or for that matter, the indecisive and naive path of hapless Piggy.	2003-03-31
US	51878010	RPR4X2TN9QOLE	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	5	0	0	N	Y	A deserved classic	I never read Lord of the Flies in high school, so, I finally got around to it, near to my 30th birthday.  It is a novel of great depth and symbolism.  The characters all represent a portion of leadership: Jack- the warmonger; Ralph- the diplomat; and Piggy- the brain behind the diplomat.  Some may say that this book is just a cynical view of human nature.  But I believe it is just realistic.  After all most of the boys that Jack scares into becoming a part of his tribe are young and therefore ignorant.  This shows how most despots keep control, by denying their population with any real higher education (except for the privileged few) and intimidating them to stay in line.  The outcome of the novel is tragic, yet a lesson in survival and civility: when might makes right, there is no progress and only fear.	2003-03-29
US	35127992	R1ZB258MZS3F1X	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	2	0	3	N	N	Tedious	Yet another book suffering from the &quot;classic-itis&quot; syndrome. Golding presents an intriguing premise and utilises provoking themes of savagery versus civilization, but he writes in such an uninspired and drawn-out manner that it's extremely difficult to truly absorb oneself into the narrative. Every character was flat and unlikeable in at least one way; the only one that came close to gaining my interest was one I pitied, and I deeply dislike piteous characters.<br />I am female, and I have usually never minded any lack of prominent female roles in books or films. The way Golding uses the female here, though, is half-baked and somewhat insulting. As well, while I don't mind symbolism if it's varied and carefully used, there is only really one large symbolic theme in this book, and I found it rather elementary and fumbled.<br />I don't mind gore either -- among my favourite books is All Quiet on the Western Front, and despite its skewered view, one of my favourites movies is the hyperrealistic Black Hawk Down -- but the gore here has almost no emotional value at all and simply disgusts.<br />The closing paragraphs are the only parts that came close to being interesting, if just for the symbolic contrast it provided. Even then, however, because Golding for me had built no tension or suspense whatsoever up to it, it merely showed how silly the entire affair and its participants were, and almost made me laugh despite the apparent gravity that was involved.<br />It may have been all the enthusiasm around it from other readers, but even so, William Golding's &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is one of the worst &quot;good&quot; books I have ever read.	2003-03-23

I liked both Ralph's and Jack's opposing personalities.  I believe if this situation were to actually happen, kids could act this way.  William Golding's book is believable.<br /> The theme of Lord of the Flies is decision-making affects your future.  Ralph's conservative, hard work ethic is a good philosophy if getting off the island is the goal.  Yet Jack is a liberal, spontaneous soul with no other goal than to have a fun time on the island.  At times I have to make vital decisions just like the older boys.  On one hand they can decide to build a fire for smoke to signal to ships passing by and also make huts for shelter.  Or they could spend their time hunting, feasting, having fun and hoping for a ship to fortuitously come rescue them.  William Golding makes the story believable by revealing all the younger boys and most of the older boys to be impulsive. I feel that real boys probably would behave the same way in this situation.  When all the \\"biguns\\" except Ralph and Piggy decide to hunt instead of make huts, it isn't what I would do.  But many of the boys I've known would take Jack's philosophy.  I have seen people take foolish risks and I have seen people not take enough risks.  Some of the former  have lost the desire to do well in sports in which they had great potential.  While the latter have lost friends from isolating themselves.<br /> The book is average until about two-thirds of the way in.  There was one part of the book that hooked and reeled me in when Jack confronts Ralph's leadership ability.  The one line that made the book great in my eyes is on page 127 when Jack angrily asks, \\"Who thinks Ralph oughtn't to be chief?\\"  This line sets up the way the book plays out and it got me really thinking about what was going to happen next.  I would highly recommend this book to others because in the beginning it just seems like an average book and then it gets exciting, worrisome and hard to put down.then it gets exciting, worrisome and hard to put down.	2003-03-12

The only good part was the last chapter!!! Here is a basic synopsis of the book: A bunch of boys are stranded on an Island. They know how they got there, an airplane. None of them know each other (unless they went to school with others), yet they were all on the same plane. The pilot did not survive. Some of the boys become obssessed with killing while others are obssessed with being rescued. Kids die and a few turn cannibalistic.

This is an amazing story of a journey that goes awry, and of the growing menace that confronts those who survive--a menace from within as well as without. What begins in a spirit of cooperation turns dark as betrayal and temptation overtake our little protagonists. The diminutive leader and his chubby sidekick are good-hearted but unsure that they are fit for this quest, and encounter those who would rather ignore their responsibilities and enjoy life while they can. The wilderness that the Fellowship must confront is hazardous enough, but envy and spite gnaw away at the heart of one who travels with them, who would take the Ring for himself. This was J. R. R.

I thought that it was dry, boring and more than a little irritating. Then when I reread it more than 10 times over the course of two years and studied every single character and happenstance in depth, I began to appreciate the scope and vision of this literary masterpiece. There is no question that Golding has written one of the greatest novels in the history of time.<br />The Lord of the Flies is at first glance a simple story of a group of boys stranded on an island who get carried away and grow \\"wild\\". Yet upon a second glance we see that it is truly a tale of \\"the end of innocence\\" and \\"the darkness of man's heart\\" (found on the last page as Ralph grieves). Golding explicitly illustrates the primeval power of human nature, a surging, uncontrollable force that let loose from its bindings of society and order, and laws, can run rampant and revert to the way it was in the beginning: complete chaos.<br />Golding masterfully uses metaphors and symbolism throughout the book. A few important examples include the fat boy, Piggy, ridiculed by so many of the boys on the island, is depicted as \\"the voice of reason\\", while Simon, a shy and insightful boy, is depicted in a saint-like manner, a crusader for peace, a Jesus-like character who possesses the only means to bring revelation to the boys. Early on in the book, the boys find the conch, a fragile symbol of societal law and order.<br />We eventually find that Piggy is killed, crushing the voice of reason, as is Simon, crushing hope and goodness, and the conch is smashed, relieving the small society of law and order. With all these three things gone, then darkness rages throughout the island. And who is responsible for the destruction of those three important symbols? None other than Jack, the totalitarian ringleader of his island faction, a Hitler-like representative of corruptness, greed, domination, and overall a person totally given over to the dark side of human nature.<br />Those are just a few of the symbols that are introduced in Golding's book, throughout the novel there are a plethora of many more that require an inquisitive mind to unlock their secrets and achieve a higher level of understand of the constant battle of our existence. This is without a doubt a masterpiece. Golding has created a work of fiction that is not just suited for a younger generation of readers but also for an older generation. At any age, his darkly compelling story is enough to provoke the deepest of thoughts and introspective self-reexamination.over to the dark side of human nature. <br />Those are just a few of the symbols that are introduced in Golding's book, throughout the novel there are a plethora of many more that require an inquisitive mind to unlock their secrets and achieve a higher level of understand of the constant battle of our existence.

I've read this book twice (almost completely) and love everything about it. The way Golding set it up innocently using young boys as a warning to the entire world they better watch out, the concept is not so far fetched.<br />  The book starts simply enough, stranded boys on a deserted island where they must learn how to survive or perish. First the initial shock of where and how and why passes and soon enough you see the boys imitating their civilized upbringing by creating their own set of rules and laws, establishing a hierarchy in order to survive. A marvelous concept considering they are on a stranded island with no adults, no one telling them they can't play; possibly showing the boys are capable of reason and adapting despite their age and maturity.<br />  The book reads fast and has a message for the reader, and for anyone willing to listen, honestly. Upon devouring the words I hadn't read in over ten years from the first time, I realized a lot was missed the first time around and that might be the point. Don't take things for granted because it just may end up flipping on you and you are left holding the short end of the stick. I think Golding did have a message and I truly wonder if people understood it.<br />  As stated in the title, I love this book. It is a true &quot;classic&quot; and a must read for anyone. I do question why 14 and 15 year-olds must read it, for at that age I didn't understand or care for the topic. The second time around though, I did understand and welcome the topic. Every page left me wanting another, praying these kids understand before it's too late. Unfortunately, there is an emotional connection between me and this book keeping me from picking it up again. Sometimes fiction imitates life too much and at the point in the book where Piggy and Ralph go searching for Piggy's glasses, I learned two planes slammed into the World Trade Towers. What a time and place for symbology.<br />  Nevertheless, &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is an excellent book, maybe one of these years I'll pick it up again after the emotional ties to it are a bit more removed, but I feel everyone should read it at least once.an excellent book, maybe one of these years I'll pick it up again after the emotional ties to it are a bit more removed, but I feel everyone should read it at least once.	2003-01-18

I read this book in eighth grade - alright, it was about two years ago - and I still read it occasionally.

These schoolboys have grown up on London and life that is perfectly serene, so when they find themselves on a deserted island - with no grownups, what a great life! - they think this is something new to them and has to be explored.<br />But as time goes on, things aren't as pretty as the island sets out to be. Things get ugly, and intrusive and bloody. (One scene is not for the squeamish!) Things are not as easy as they seem, but unlike life back home, there are no grownups to turn to and have them put things right. There is only control in the one boy who has it, and there is no turning back.<br />LOTF is a good read, it really is. Just be sure, if you read it in English class, to get ready to analyze it.

Golding is a master craftsman of the language. His sentences and paragraphs are intricately designed; his metaphors evoke mood and mental imagery without stopping the flow of the narrative. And what a narrative it is, at that. Like Joseph Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS, it is a compelling glance into the destructiveness at the heart of humanity as it devours and consumes the finer instincts, all cloaked in the guise of a pulpy adventure story. The characters manage to be both symbolic and complex.<br />There are many novels you probably avoided reading in tenth grade English that are overrated, pretentious psychobabble. This is not one of them. It is a page-turner that will haunt you long after you reach the ending.	2002-11-29

The story tells about how they developed leaders and routine for their lives.  It was a well written book, although sometimes it was hard to follow.  Some portions were a bit disturbing, but it kept me entertained, and that takes a lot.  I'd say this book is like Peter Pan meets Cast Away. It was a wonderful story on adventure and survival.	2002-11-26

The plane was carrying boys from a British school.  The boys find themselves on a deserted island without any adults.  A boy by the name Ralph is chosen as the chief, and Jack gets jealous.  Jack leads the boys that were a choir and they are elected as the hunters.  The small children are given the name \\"littluns,\\" and don't usually do any work at all.  Sam and Eric, the twins, work at the top of the mountain to keep a fire going in case of a boat or plane passing by.  Piggy, an outcast of the group, is useful in only the fact that he has glasses that are used to light the fire.  Rumors of a beast on the island spread.  One night, a pilot parachutes onto the island and dies on impact.  Sam and Eric assume that it is the Beast, and frighten the boys with their story.  Jack, who is starving for power at this point, decides to lead the boys to another part of the island to begin a tribe.  Ralph and Piggy remain in the shelters.  Jack's hunters go from boys to animals- smearing paint on their faces and hunting.  Jack and the hunters tie up a boy, Wilfred, for no apparent reason.  Simon, a boy of good sense, realizes that the Beast is only a dead pilot and frantically runs to tell Jack and the others.  They think that the Beast has posessed Simon and kill him.  Piggy and Ralph take part in this, but they cannot figure out why they did so.  Eventually another boy is killed and a couple are captured.  Ralph tries to hide from Jack and the hunters.  Finally, a naval ship comes to rescue the boys, but Ralph cries as they leave the island because he knows that the boys have lost their innocence.<br />This book displays a good sense of what society can be today.  Although people may seem civilized, we are to some extent barbaric in the ways we live.  Many are hungry for power and money when, really, these are not essential to life in any form.  The search for an idol in the story was mostly to give the boys something to do.  It is unfortunate that even today, as innocent as it may seem, people have created idols.  They are being deceived.  If people could realize that survival on Earth is only possible through accepting Christ and having a relationship with God, then they would not be so deceived.  This book was a good lesson in how our lives can turn messy if we don't follow instructions and rules set before us.s unfortunate that even today, as innocent as it may seem, people have created idols.

What would you do? Well, that is exactly what the boys in The Lord of the Flies have to ponder. Four leaders emerge, but in different strengths and the best leader is elected. One leader knows what the people want, another one knows what is good for everybody and what should be done, another one is always helpful, and the last one who is elected knows what the people want and also what is good for them. The story starts out well with all of the characters loving the place, but then it is turned upside-down. There are divisions in people and what they should do which starts discrimination. Each group becomes independent and hates each other. Lord of the Flies represents every character as a real life person in a real society and shows how we are all born evil. Our society will never work out because of our human nature and our natural sin. The end, or the termination of society is extraordinarily gripping and powerful and dreadfully true. This book should be read and analyzed as it is read. In other words, this book is not to be read as an adventure book, for it is a very bad one, it is read to portray a very potent theme.	2002-11-13

I didn't understand any of the symbolism and I just thought that Golding was a sicko who was writing about kids acting unrealisticly savage and brutal, and he used way too many weird English words. I just recently was assigned to read this book in my sophmore English class and I now really enjoy the book. I think that this book is incredibly deep and thought provoking and can only be enjoyed if you are open trying to understand the underlying themes. This novel brilliantly explores human nature and the effect of civilization on people. Lord of the Flies is a great read and I highly reccomend it to everyone.

At first and for the most of the way through the book it is slow and just informs you on whats going on. Not many things are going on to the point where it almost gets boring, but just when your starting to get fled up with the books slow pace everything goes crazy.  Poeple start dying and some other poeple start freaking out.  William Goldings very descriptive writting brings some very graphic images to mind. The way Golding adds many hidden meanings in the book alsoo makes it very interesting.  You start to realize that the book is more than just a common story of boys deserted on an island and what they do to survive.  The book has much more meaning that and if you can figure it out it actually makes the reading fun. All  in all this book deserves 4 stars at the very least.	2002-09-30

It's a story about a dozen boys who are stranded on an island alone after the plane crash kills their parents.  Their biggest struggle was finding leadership among a group of immature children.  The main characters of this story are Raplh, Jack Merridew, and Piggy.  Ralph is the oldest, Jack is the leader of the choir, and Piggy is a fat boy who has no friends.  The theme of this story is that everyone should stick together no matter how bad conditions get.  As you near the end of the book, the boys begin to spread apart into a group of savages with no rules.  Sadly, all the disorder ends in two of the boys deaths.  I recommend this book to anyone from the 7th or 8th grade.  You should read it sometime.  It is a really great book.	2002-09-30

It is so realistic and scary, because it is totally clear in its tactics and themes all at the same time!  The characters in this novel realize by the end that humanity and goodness in the human heart does not exist.  And that civility and propriety are simply facades created by the restraints of a general will in society.  The characters, by the end, all face up to the darkness of human nature.  What sets them apart, however, is how they react to this knowledge.  Jack and his followers deal with it by killing those who are about to tell them the truth about themselves-that they are out of control and that the beast of decay, destruction, insanity, chaos and paranoia has taken over their souls and has made them as dark and evil as he is.  Ralph, on the other hand, denies it right up until he is being hunted like an animal, and then accepts it with tears and sobs of grief for \\"the end of innocence, the darkness of a man's heart, and the fall through the air of the true, wise friend called Piggy.\\" In short, this story takes us into a place that we never want to go, and tells us things that we don't want to believe about ourselves.	2002-09-18

It was a favorite for most of the students in my class so I decided to give the novel another try and I'm glad I did...I read this book a second time very quickly as I was intrigued by everything that went on in LOTF and I learned a valuable lesson in that if you don't come together in a time of need you will suffer and also that we sometimes fear what will happen and fear to help others so we are classified as &quot;beasts&quot;  I found something valuable the second time I read this novel rather than the first go around...Do read this book..I think you will enjoy it and get a lot from it.	2002-08-15

And if you watch a movie version, read the book first. The old black and white film version cast with British kids is a million times better than the more recent color version with American kids -- probably because American kids are *already* savage...they have no civilized habits to lose! :-)<br />There is an incredible scene in the book where some older boys toss rocks at a younger boy who is playing in the water. The author notes the the older boys are careful not to throw the rocks too close to the younger boy: I believe he calls the protective perimeter thus formed the circle of civilization or something. Anyway, it's a great and important passage; look for it. It foreshadows all the madness to follow.<br />Here's a suggestion for a term paper (it worked for me): The character named &quot;Piggy&quot; wears spectacles that he fastidiously cares for when the boys are first marrooned; however, the spectacles are slowly demolished step by step as the boys descend into savagery. By examining the condition of Piggy's spectacles, you can judge how bad things have gotten on the island.	2002-08-03

Count me among the latter.<br />I didn't know what to expect when I picked up this book.  I was pleasantly surprised by Golding's depth and sharp insight.  Despite the youth of its main characters, Lord of the Flies is not some juvenile adventure novel.  Golding's bleak commentary on the absolute evil (the \\"Lord of the Flies\\") that lies in our hearts, waiting for just the slightest opportunity to throw civilization into chaos is chilling and powerful.<br />I hope that those people who read this book in high school go back and read it again later in life, especially those who did not like it.  Lord of the Flies is not an exercise in finding symbolism and motifs ... it's about understanding the point that Golding makes through his story.  Lord of the Flies is clearly one of the more compelling and intense books I've read in a long time.  I highly recommend it.	2002-08-02

It tells about how a group of british boys learn the meaning of survival after their plane is crashed and their stranded on an Island with no parents.  It's also about how living on the island changed their lives.  The 3 main charactors are Jack, Piggy, and Ralph.  Jack is very pushy to Piggy because Piggy is fat, wears glasses, and has asthma but is friendly to Ralph.  But all that changes when Jack lets a fire go out that causes a plane that passes by not to see them, after Jack becomkes more aggressive and just cares about hunting.  Soon Jack starts his own tribe and the group slowly seperates from being with Ralph to going with Jack.  Jack's group starts doing mean things like stealing Piggy's glasses to make a fire.

It is, i think, one of the most important books in history because it represents human nature. Okay, i don't want to psyche 101 all you guys, but this book challenges the theory in of the \\"naturall goodness of man\\", a theory rationalized in its similar predecessor, Coral Island. Golding suggests that maybe, just maybe, man alone is not good, and there may be a part of him that will always be evil in its own way (the id, for all you Freudians out there) It suggests that sooner or later, everyone would have been consumed by this primordial and savage part of oneself, all except Simon, the Christ Figure, to whom nothing bad would ever happen, besides having the fate of a martyr. So not only can most situations in this book be almost directly related to a Freudian analogy,even the characters, but you will also see that anything in the book he mentions more than once does have some kind of symbolic meaning in the book, and you can find out what it is. The book also lets some wiggle room, enough to include your own perspective and ideas. Bottom line:<br />a must-read!!!!	2002-06-25

US	38043804	RU16UEHGHRB8Y	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	4	0	1	N	N	more good than bad	Some people were right about how the author tends to go on and on and on, yapping about trees, rocks, sand, etc. on the island.  In the novel, the descriptions were too monotonous and I did not notice that i was skipping vital parts of the book that were hidden between tedious plant matter...<br />But once I started re-reading certain parts of the book, I've realized why the book won that prestigious whatever-its-called prize.  It really did tell of the horrors of humankind that outweigh the good, and it's symbols were powerful, especially the lord of the flies character.<br />The character I admire the most has to be Simon.  Then maybe Piggy or Ralph.  But Simon is a symbol of the good of human nature.  Simon helps the \\"lilluns\\" reach the fruit, he gives Piggy his meat, and admires nature in his special spot in the island.  He represents human instinct, but not the bad kind, not the one of selfishness and savage, but of goodness and kindness to everything as a whole.  The sad part is that there aren't many people like Simon, and in the end, he is taken over by the evil, the \\"darkness\\", the \\"beast\\" that exists in the savage kids, and essentially in everyone. And sadly, before he could tell everyone his discoveries.<br />What i find quite strange is that in the end, the savage tribe is saved by their own device. That's funny, and it didn't really seem fitting to the book's nature.  But it worked to it's advantage, as it signify's the loss of innocence in the boys.<br />When people say that this book is unrealistic, I ask them, \\"Well have you ever got stuck in an unknown Island with a bunch of kids you don't know for a couple of months?\\"<br />The children in the island represent society.  Using children as a symbol only makes the effect of the novel stronger.

It is a chillingly true look at the darkest of human nature. To the casual reader, it may seem just to be an adventure of lost boys. However, it has a darker and more sinister commentary on the nature of man. If you enjoy grand and classic literature, buy Sir William Golding's THE LORD OF THE FLIES today.<br />The novel centres around four boys among several stranded on a presumably Pacific island. Each one is symbolic of a different aspect of human nature. In the beginning, each is still bound by societal limits. As time progresses, things turn for the worst as these limits melt away. Golding masterfully shows this waring away of society, one of the novel's finer points. One of the novel's flaws is that is tedious at many points. Otherwise, it is a grand novel.<br />If you enjoy classic literature, you should read this novel. If you enjoy thought-provoking work, read this novel. If you enjoy a highly pessimistic commentary on man's nature, read the book. If you don't enjoy tedious reading, or don't like reading a dark book about the evils of man, this novel is not for you...	2002-06-11

Equal parts \\"Robinson Caruso\\" and \\"Children of the Corn,\\" \\"Lord of the Flies\\" by William Golding explores our human nature in a way not seen before.<br />Stranded on a uninhabited island, a group of young English boys are left to survive without the influence of an adult. Chaos slowly materializes as the boys gradually lose track of their main goal: to be rescued. Nighttime comes to sybmolize fear and death as a mysterious \\"beast\\" rears its ugly head. Ralph and Piggy struggle to remain \\"civilized\\" while Jack and others begin to be absorbed by their animalistic urges.<br />One thing that stood out to me was Golding's use of imagery. From the tiniest details of the island to almost palpable tension that devolops on the island, Golding does a magnificent job of portraying it all.<br />However, the aspect of this book that makes it outstanding is the psychology behind the story. As the children begin to fully realize that there are no adults to give them guidance, a darkness falls over them. Long term survival becomes secondary to the immediate need to have \\"fun.\\" The children evolve from being hunted to being vicious hunters.<br />I highly recommend this as both a good story and as a psychological study. I believe it could be an invaluable guide for high school students leaving home for the first time and experiencing a sense of freedom that can parallel that of the boys in this novel. Even if you are well past that stage, it's worth reading to get an understanding of what people might be experiencing.	2002-06-11

They land on a tropical island devoid of adults and start their own society.  So begins Lord of the Flies, by William Golding.<br /> There are three main characters in this book: Ralph, Piggy, and Jack.  Ralph is strong and sensible.  He is confident that they will be rescued and meanwhile works to make the island a better place.  Piggy is obese and a social outcast.  However, he is very wise and tries to advise Ralph, because Ralph is his only friend.  Ralphs archenemy, Jack, is bossy.  He grows a love for hunting and violence.<br /> Right after the crash landing on the island, Ralph finds a conch shell and blows on it, gathering all the boys on the island.  He decides there should be an election to determine a chief of the island.  Ralph represents democracy.  He gets elected chief, and does his best to make sure that everyone is equal.  Ralph starts a fire on a mountain with Piggys eyeglasses, hoping that passing ships will see a smoke signal.  Shelters are built on the shore and food is plentiful.  The boys are enchanted by the idea of their own world that they control.<br /> But inevitably, disturbing events start to occur.  A boy sees a snake thing in the woods and other see monsters.  This gets everyone frightened.  Soon a mission is started to find and kill the beast.<br /> Later, after Jack kills a pig, he develops a love for hunting.  With an army of boys he starts hunting for pigs.  They invent a game in which they form a circle.  Another boy comes into the middle of the circle, and the boys on the outside beat him, chanting, Kill the pig!  Cut her throat!  Spill her blood!  Several boys are injured as a result of this violent ritual.<br /> Jack also becomes very rebellious against Ralph and his leadership.  For one, Jack is apathetic about the fire on the mountain.  He doesnt see that the fire is the only way to be rescued.  Jack represents totalitarianism and dictator ship.<br /> Despite being very creative and original, the book has some weaknesses.  For one, it paints a very pessimistic view of mankind.  It implies that kids are not inherently innocent, but instead evil when deprived of law and order.  Lord of the Flies can also get boring at times.  Hunting for pigs, keeping the fire going, finding the beast: these themes reappear so many times it feels repetitive.  Too much description also causes the book to be monotonous at times.  However, the thrilling climax more than makes up for these minor weaknesses.<br /> Goldings writing style is usually both interesting and engaging.  It offers insight into what would happen to innocent children when in a world of their own, without parents and authority.  In the end, everything turns out fine, but only after an exciting chase and battle.  On the surface, Lord of the Flies is an adventure story about boys trapped on a tropical island.

The tale of a group of boys who are reduced to killing each other is a welcomed change from literary pop culture. The author does an outstanding job bringing out the dark side of human nature which civilization hides.<br />  This book is about a bunch of British boys who become stranded on an island. Ralph, the chief, tries to establish a functioning society with rules and laws but his little tribe of boys is corrupted by the dominant, jealous Jack who promises the boys meat, killing and glory. Ralph attempts to bring survival back into perspective but is only taunted and abandoned.This story is a masterpiece and I would recommend this to any daring readers.

This is one of the few books in my elite \\"bounce\\" category -- it bounced off the wall when I finished it. I am aware of all the praise that has been heaped upon this book. This is one of the times at which I must find myself unable to really even comprehend the reasoning (if any) that goes on in the minds of those who have handed out the awards.<br />_Lord of the Flies_ is, we are told, a novel about human beings and their nature. It's a shame we see so few human beings in the book. Golding seems to see savagery as the natural and instinctive state of humanity, a position that's logically untenable (if this was the \\"natural\\" way, exactly how did we acquire civilization at all, let alone keep it long enough to develop the printing press necessary to spread such [negativity]?)<br />Ignoring the stated literary intent, the book is on the surface the story of shipwrecked children trying to survive, a la Robinson Crusoe and Mysterious Island. However, in this aspect it also fails miserably, with characters not even covering the gamut of behavior one would suspect from children (at least some would have tried making a boat, one would think; while the exact time Lord of the Flies takes place is indeterminate, Kon-Tiki had sailed from Peru to Polynesia in 1947, something the character Piggy, at least, would probably have known), and with one of the most important parts of a survival story -- the survival science -- being gotten dismally wrong. This is most notable in having the NEARSIGHTED Piggy's glasses be used to start a fire, and it's one of the least excusable; even if Golding himself wasn't nearsighted, one would think he'd have one or two acquaintances whose glasses he could borrow for a second to test the idea.<br />Admittedly, Golding has an excellent grasp of the language and uses it well. The book is well-written in a technical sense. Yet it fails utterly on both its major levels, failing to convince me of its major thesis on human behavior, and wrecking the suspension of disbelief in its overt plotline.<br />I was personally quite aware of the potential savage nature of young people -- I was one of the bullied types -- yet the level of cynicism necessary to accept Lord of the Flies' ideas never came to me. I think Golding misses an essential streak of optimism that exists in young people, a willingness to try things and a dedication to survive that explains the fact that we're still a civilized species instead of a scattered group of savages barely above the flint-chipping level.ension of disbelief in its overt plotline.<br />I was personally quite aware of the potential savage nature of young people -- I was one of the bullied types -- yet the level of cynicism necessary to accept Lord of the Flies' ideas never came to me.

The story's beginning is that English kids are cast away in the coral island because of the plane crash.  They choose Ralph as a chief and start building own community to survive and to be rescued.  They explore the island and hunt a pig for food and make a fire as a SOS signal.  The community is working at first.  But little by little the community is being broken up.  Finally some kids pick Jack as a leader and form the other community.  When I read this book, I felt how difficult to keep people together.  It's not easy to satisfy all people in a community, even people can communicate each other.  There is always a conflict we cannot solve by talking between people.  And the other thing I found is that happy thing doesn't always happen in a life.  Some scenes, like Piggy's death, might be disgusting.  But the life is usually full of disasters.  We have to accept those things.  I learned we should not live in a dream world.  A bad thing can happen anytime.  And it is important whether we can overcome it.  I recommend this book.	2002-05-22
US	36368531	R28VDLUVIN8J9Y	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Lord of the Flies	The novel Lord of the Flies by William Golding, published by The Berkley Publishing Group (1954) is an action filled book about some schoolboys' struggle for survival after their plane went down on a deserted island.<br /> After the boys are stranded on the island it becomes evident that surviving will be like no other task they have ever undertaken.  They learn to fend for themselves by trapping and killing animals, building shelters with branches and by learning how to use their surroundings in the quest for survival.  From the very beginning there is tension over who is the leader.  It comes down to which candidate has more appealing priorities, playing and hunting all-day or trying to get rescued by keeping a fire alive. While in the hunt for food the boys become total savages, to the extent where they even wage war against each other.<br /> In my eyes the message is that there is a savage in all of us and it comes out the minute we are faced with extreme hardships. The author does not only use the actions of the boys to show the changes that have occurred, but he also uses visual imagery to show their physical changes.  For example, in the beginning of the book the boys are well-dressed clean-cut shorthaired boys; however, by the end of the book they are dirty, longhaired animals. Also, to add to their already dirty look, the boys paint their faces to camouflage themselves when they go hunting. The way the boys changed in appearance reflects how they're losing their civilized upbringing.<br /> In my opinion the novel Lord of the Flies was a great book especially for children around my age because it is easy for us to identify with what the kids in the book are going through.  Even though I found this novel very exciting and engaging, I would never hope to be put in such a position as the boys in the story were.	2002-05-22

It is probably the greatest book I've ever read, and here's why. I was absolutely fascinated with the characters. They were all so interesting and they always had me expecting something. They all had their own theme. The book is full of themes and mostly each character represents one of the &quot;presidents&quot; of the theme. For example:<br />Ralph is a leader in the book. He represents democracy in an anarchy based society. This is just one of many examples of theme used in the book. Another thing that was important to the book was the setting. The setting always played a special part in the book whether it give rest to the reader in between tense moments, or provide a source of imagination in the action packed parts. The plot was very believable even though it was a fiction book. I would reccomend this book to anyone over the age of 15. It has a very deep meaning and may not be understood with the mind that hasn't been exposed to some of the things in this book. Enjoy!	2002-05-09

I picked up this book when someone had mentioned they were required to read it in school as children.  This book is about the end of innocence and the heart of darkness.  Ok, before you get scared away by the two phrases I just mentioned, let me explain.  So without even reading the book, you probably know it's about a bunch of English schoolboys who get stranded on an island and are forced to survive without the supervision of adults.  This book is supposed to be full of symbolisms; each character and animal represent some idea or entity in society.  The end of innocence I mentioned begins with the slaughter of a pig for food.  The heart of darkness comes when the leader of the hunting tribe loses his mental stability and decides to hunt for more than just pig.<br />It's actually a very short story (208 pages), and the dialogue is very simplistic.  I found the author's descriptions of the jungle, beach, lagoon, and mountain to be quite boring.  (You'll also notice that I said schoolboys in the last paragraph; there are no girls in this story.  There is no underlying love story.  There is no humor.  There is no excitement whatsoever.)<br />To be honest, I don't like this book.  Even less so as required reading for school kids.  To not interpret the symbolisms would be to leave the book as a plotless story.  Yet to interpret it would mean exposing children to the horrors of savagery, abuse and survival.<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<br />============================<br />L (Language) - 3 (You can put as much interpretation as you want in the &quot;symbolisms&quot; of this book, but I'm too lazy to let my mind wander in search of a deeper meaning.)<br />E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a)<br />A (Action) - 0.5 (You really can't get excited over a bunch of schoolboys and a few pigs.)<br />P (Plot) - 2 (Boys get stranded, boys form a society, boys survive and wait for rescue.)	2002-05-07

A group of young boys left alone on an island must work together to stay alive and possibly be rescued. At first they are successful, but in the end they fail miserably. The group splits into savage vs. civil, and things get crazy. Although I wouldn't consider this book one of my favorites, I liked the way the boys' struggle represents real struggles that go on in the world. There are many themes in this book, and in general the book mirrors human nature and the realities of our civilization today. In the end, everyone in the book did what made them happy, even if it didn't work for the group. Our world today is much like this, people are mostly concerned about themselves. There are many conflicts in this book, between leaders and followers, order and chaos, work and play. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes action and conflict.

On a summer camp, the plane's engine fails. As the aircraft sinks into the wilderness of the deep ocean, the boys who'd been fortunate enough to land on the sandy island shore face an ultimate challenge. The eldest of the troop being only 11 or 12 years old, the children are left to fend for themselves, not knowing what to expect - would they ever be rescued? Would they ever see their parents again? The struggle to survive was not the only conflict the boys faced. It was a fairly large team, and political issues such as who is &quot;the leader&quot; comes into figure. Would greed and different faiths break up the boys in battle, or would it glue them closer together? How is it that some boys end up murderion other guys on purpose?<br />This novel presents a realistic event, which makes it fun to read. I would recommend this book for people aged 10 and up who would like to find out how past people were like in their youth, and are interested in issues relating to fairth, hope, trust, and betrayal.	2002-04-29
US	45838740	R10TBDMIL03DB6	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Unbelieveably haunting	One of the last books my class was to read in English in our senior year, William Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is considered by many a classic, but it as more of a haunting portrait of the loss of innocence and the degredation of humanity.  The story revolves around the Cold War, a nuclear war has begun and the children of England have been evacuated in airplanes.  One of the planes crashes on a tropical island.  At first, the children are led by Ralph, who calls assemblies by blowing on his conch, his fat but wise friend Piggy, and the seemingly flat out weird but helpful Simon.  But when Jack, a hunter of the wild pigs on the island, challenges Ralph's rule, chaos ensues, and this tropical paradise becomes a living hell for Ralph, Piggy, and Simon.  Golding's sense of symbolism makes the book work, from the very beginning we know Ralph is the good guy and Jack is the unprecidented evil in the making.  Even the title of the book is an example of symbolism; when Simon encounters \\"The Lord of the Flies\\", we see this (the title is the definition of Beelzebub, which is Hebrew for Satan), but its up in the air whether Simon had a sixth sense or if he was just crazy when he encountered \\"The Lord of the Flies\\" (Simon as well symbolizes Christ, he helped the younger children, gathered food, and built the huts along with the fact he was tempted to join Jack's crew).  Undoubtadly one of the best books I have ever had to read for school, William Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies\\" is an essential read for everyone.	2002-04-26

Golding uses a group of boys stranded on a desolate island to portray life without enforced order and civility. The boys represent many different types of people in society.  My favorite characters are Piggy, Simon, and Ralph.  Piggy is the intelligent, fat boy with asthma and glasses.  Simon is the sensitive, shy boy who shares his meat and helps the younger children get fruit.  Ralph is the chief of the boys who struggles with reality and responsibility. He must face his antagonist, Jack, who is a power-hungry boy obsessed with hunting. It is captivating to follow the steady conversion of the boys from sensibility to savagery.  Golding makes a profound statement about society through his character development and vivid descriptions of the boys' daily activities.

If so, there's no excuse for not picking it up immediately.<br />It starts, famously, with English schoolboys in an airplane crash on a deserted island in the wake of nuclear war (and - lest we be too hard on the boys - this point is deliberately made to show that adults fared no better than the boys will). The pilot, the only adult on board, is killed - and the boys have to create a civilization from scratch.<br />Eventually factions are formed, and tensions arise between the \\"rescue\\" faction led by a boy named Ralph, which focuses on keeping their shelters in repair and a signal fire burning, and the \\"hunting\\" faction led by a boy named Jack, which becomes less focused on prioritizing rescue and slowly start to like their hunting a little too much...<br />Eventually the rescue faction dwindles to Ralph; Piggy, a stereotypical nerd who nevertheless becomes Ralph's firmest ally in keeping some kind of order; Sam and Eric, two basically decent twins and Simon, a kind, painfully shy epileptic who has the firmest handle on what's really happening to them.<br />With things spinning out of control, Ralph and Piggy confront Jack to try to restore a semblance of sanity, while Simon faces psychic battle with the Lord of the Flies, who represents - depending on the reader - Simon's prodigious understanding of chaos, the evil within not only all the boys but all of us, the devil himself, or all three, which are not mutually exclusive.<br />A dark, disturbing masterpiece.	2002-04-18

US	43067315	RDPYMFOCCVDZ2	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Powerful comment on human evil	Lord of the Flies was a well-written book, chock-full of symbolism and motifs and themes. However, some of the prose I disliked, and the plot skipped weeks at a time. The setting of the story is an idyllic island. The island is marred, however, by the arrival of a plane of boys that crashes on the island, who were being carried away from wartime Britain. The story probably occurs sometime during World War II. The incident that incites the conflict between Ralph and Jack, the characters who represent pragmatic leadership versus violent evil, is the vote for chief of the island. Jack loses bitterly to Ralph, his only support being his own reluctant choir (he is head choirboy). Ralph, ever the eager diplomat, awards Jack the choir as his to command. Jack declares the choir the hunters, which foreshadows how they will begin to hunt Ralph. The tribe, though, is still firmly behind Ralph and his belief in democracy and rules.<br />The book progresses into the essential conflict between Ralph and Jack, as several deaths fuel the fire. The book is essentially a social allegory, a comment on the untamable brutality of humankind.<br />The savagery of this book makes some shocking points about human brutality, and forces the reader to look inward and see some of that brutality in herself. The reader must have patience to adjust to the writing style, but the allegory about the inescapable violence of humanity is powerful and disturbing. Overall reading this book is rewarding.	2002-04-13

The novel Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, is the suspenseful and graphic story of a group of English boys stranded on an island.  The book starts out with the boys already on the island.  The main character, Ralph, finds a conch shell, which plays a major roll in the book, take the conch and blows on to make a loud sound that calls everyone together.  Once they are all there they decided that they needed a leader and since Ralph had the shell all the little kids voted for him.  The other runner in that competition was Jack, the leader of an older set of boys and the only person on the island with a knife.  Ralph gave Jack and his boys the job of hunting.  Another person on the island is Piggy, a heavyset boy with asthma and glasses, a very essential part of their survival.  Over time some of the little kid go crazy and run away to be savages.  Eventually every one leaves Ralph and he is hunted like a dog.<br />  Here are some things that were good and bad about this book.  The plot seems basic at first, boys stuck on island have to survive, but then it goes deeper with mysterious creatures, hallucinations and murders.  Since it had a good plot it keeps you reading.  The vocabulary is another superior factor of the book.  The vocabulary gives you a thorough picture in your mind of the island and it inhibiters.  Also the book was only 200 pages long so it's an easy read.  A not so good feature about this book is it graphic images.  At some points it got so disgusting I had to stop reading and go do something else.  In additional the ending was predicting.  I'm not going to tell about the ending.  Over all I would give this book an eight out of ten for the reasons above.  I would recommend this book to anyone that likes an alternative to the basic survival story.  Also the reader should be in 7th to 10th grade.	2002-04-12

The movie was good...the book is even better.<br />This entralling novel of survival will have you thinking and wondering. After a plane full of British school boys crash land on a deserted island, the heads of sense and savagery will collide. Without adults to provide a \\"column of strength,\\" the boys are left to live on their own. Started out as a united tribe of sorts, somewhere down the line they begin to split. A small group of boys with the main character, Ralph, as their chief believed that the most important thing was to keep a fire going and to be rescued. The other boys, lead by stubborn Jack, wanted to hunt and kill. This group was soon decorated in \\"war paint\\" and doing tribal dances around the fire.<br />As you read, you will most likely find yourself rooting for the sensible, protagonists of this story, but think about this: Do you think most people might end up acting in the same way as the \\"savages\\" ended up being? Is it not human nature to rule and survive? Can the boys be blamed for losing their heads, especially under the conditions that they were in?<br />This book was beautifully written, yet lacked absolute depth. The book itself is only a little over 200 pages, and the plot skips weeks at a time, often confusing readers as to how much time has passed...	2002-03-22

Somehow, this book wasn't required reading in any of my high school or college classes, so I had no idea what it was about when I picked it up (on a flight on my honeymoon, no less).  I thought it was a great read.  I'm not one to get into allegorical type books or story lines, but this one was good.  The author did a great job of presenting a microcosm of the best and worst sides of human behavior, or so I thought.  I thought the final page ended the book perfectly.  The kids get rescued from completely destroying themselves by adults, who are in fact part of a much larger world/society/culture trying to, well, destroy each other.  Perfect ending.	2002-03-21

He also shows that he is VERY pessimistic.  But even though reading the whole novel felt like being in a torture chamber, it was worth something.<br />The one trait that really stood out about this book was the fact that Golding used biblical references to help stand behind his statement.  For example, the little boy Simon was a representation of Jesus Christ himself.  And you pick that up as he describes a few things that happens to him.  Simon hits a tree and bleeds in the middle of his forehead.  We all know that is a flashback to when Jesus was on the cross and had the wreath of thorns placed on his head.  And what about the pig's head talking to him?  Matthew 5 tells about Jesus being tempted by the Devil, which is symbolized by the pig's head, the \\"Lord of the Flies.\\"<br />I give Lord of the Flies 5 stars because it clearly states why Golding says man is evil by nature.  People don't agree with the negative style, but Golding is just expressing an opinion and  does it \\"with grace.\\"	2002-03-19

I've heard teachers (yes, this shows the deterioration of the school system) lecture about how this hardly represents man at all.  Sad, isn't it?  This book is the best yet written about the true nature of man.  I'm sure a lot of readers say, &quot;If it were me on that island, things would've worked.&quot;  That's even sadder than the teacher thing.  If presented with the situation, we'd ALL be savages.  Every single one of us.  It's just mankind's nature.  There's no problem with embracing one's nature, contrary to popular belief.  Anywho, this book is not only exciting, insightful, gritty, and realistic, it's also very truthful.  Read this book and see for yourself.  Then you'll see that there's a little (or a lot, depending on yourself) bit of Jack inside all of us.	2002-03-15

Golding's literary genius allowed him to incorporate several important symbols, interesting characters, and relevant themes into a relatively short book.

I just finished reading Lord of the Flies in my gr. 11 English class and I wish that this book was not required to be read in school, because I do not recommend it. Although it was thought provoking, and at times you really felt for the characters, it was too grim a look at mankind. I entirely disagree with Golding's idea of mankind being inherently evil, and that made it hard to get into the book and also made it hard to believe. This was fairly well written, but I have read books that challenged my intelligence more. It is obvious that Golding wrote this book as a way of getting his point across to people, and you can see this because the reading comprehension is pretty simple and most people can breeze through it. I felt that it was borderline propaganda, and I actually regret that i have read it, but I didn't have much choice in the matter.	2002-02-28

Such an introduction will often sour the reader's interest; deflate their desire to pursue a discourse with the fragile reality the author has set up.  To those who enjoyed it the text can sometimes grow to take on a biblical veracity, spawning a cult of appreciation by the more pretentious of the youngsters who feel as though they'd accomplished something by getting something out of it.  This is the perception of Lord of the Flies today . . .<br /><br />When I was assigned to read this book in school for some reason I decided to skip it.  Who cares, I think I got a B on the test, and we moved on to Of Mice and Men or Death of A Salesman.  Nevertheless, I found myself searching out this book again years into the future, possibly inquiring into the past over something I felt I'd missed.<br /><br />The result?  A strong, swift book, sometimes beautifully written.  On occasion a point is overexplained into the discussions and mired by the efforts of young boys speaking with an Oxford Graduate Student dialect.  In other words, it sometimes gets pretty dull.  The unreality of their speech is irrelevent, mostly, if only because Golding usually uses this technique to explain much of what is going on.  It is a fine book among a long list of fine books about isolation, exile, lonliness, acceptance, faith, hope and civilization.  If the book hadn't been so overwhelmingly sub-referenced I likely would have never picked it up and missed out on an enjoyable and profound--but perhaps getting tired as you begin to age--interesting little book.	2002-02-22

What if it was to happen to you? Would you know what to do to survive?  Lord of the Flies by William Golding brings Golding's moral philosophy into an intriguing story of a group of boys crash landing on a deserted island. As the boys attempt to survive, new problems arise from the lack of society that force the boys back to the clutches of their natural instincts.<br />  A group of British schoolboys crash land on an uninhabited island somewhere in the ocean. With the only adult on the plane being killed in the crash, the two oldest of the boys, Ralph and Jack, begin a power struggle to be the leader of the boys. Ralph begins his life on the island by trying to incorporate a democracy within the group of boys. The boys then vote for a leader and they almost unanimously choose Ralph.  The boys show their wish for society by making some rules to abide by. From the moment Ralph was voted leader, Jack was always his rival, whether he showed it or not.  To show his strength, Jack starts a group of hunters that savagely kill the wild pigs on the island. The younger children of the island have their own problem, dealing with the fear of \\"The Beastie\\" supposedly a giant snake this imaginary beast develops into a creature that all of the boys' fear. Little do they know how the once imaginary beast would affect their lives.  After Ralph confronts Jack about his hunters acting savagely Jack is enraged and orders a re-vote for leader.  Once again, Ralph is voted leader again and Jack leaves the tribe to form his own group.  To add to the conflict between them, the rest of the boys split off into two groups following either Ralph or Jack as their leader.  To the reader this starts off as being a childish game, but when children start getting killed it evolves into a deadly struggle for power between the groups.<br />This book is taught in almost every school system in the country giving a new perspective of human nature with its immense amount of symbolism throughout it.  Depending on how you look at it the book can be broken down into different kinds of symbolism including human civilization, Freudian Psychology, and a religious allegory.  As a reader, I personally saw the book as a vision of human civilization in which the island is a microcosm of the world.  The main characters each represent an aspect of human society including human virtues, violence, civilization, intellect, and peace.  Aside from the characters, key objects in the story also represent something on a higher term.

But I believe this book can be enjoyable to anyone of almost any age if they have an open mind.  In my opinion, one of the main reasons why a student wouldn't like this book would be because they were forced to read it, and didn't really read deeply to discover all of the hidden meanings.

(in a good way)	It has been years since I read this book but I remember that it is the book I hold the most emotional bond with.  The characters touched the deepest recesses of my heart and held on.  The strugles that Golding incorporates into this book are remarkable.  They are realistic in the way that kids would possible go to such an extreme if a situation of isolation cropped up.  I still want to burn the book, not out of hatred to the book, but out of anger toward Sam(or whoever it was I can't remember) who killed Piggy.  I believe that it is a sign of a good book, when you WANT to destroy the book, not out of distaste with the writing or the idea, but out of distaste of the characters in the book, out of such a strong passion that you want to see the heroes enemies fail and not see the heroes fall.

William Golding's Lord of the Flies is a very well written novel set on a desert island during war times.  This novel faces many issues that include growing up and maturity, working together, lost innocence, survival, and instinct.  All of these themes are tackled by a group of schoolboys whose plane has been shot down during a war.  The description of the condition of the boys and the island scene is very vivid.  I was able to form a mental picture of the scenes easily.  Left to fend for themselves, the boys go through many experiences to survive.  Through these many grueling experiences, they must learn to hunt, cooperate with one another, fight for power among the group, and learn to adjust to living in the wild alone, without protection.  In this book, the savage instinct of humans is portrayed, at times becoming a bit too graphic for me.  However, all humans have instincts, therefore it was necessary to show these savage instincts to receive the full effects of being alone in the wild fending for yourself.  I liked how the boys in this novel, through their ups and downs, learned to work together to make their own kind of civilization, which fit their needs accordingly.  I would recommend this book for people of any age who enjoy novels that entail survival, which was the main theme of this book.	2002-01-27

Sure, Golding is trying to make a point about power's effect on social stability and structure, but it is lost in the mumbo jumbo style that he writes with. (The movie is also a pathetic depiction of this clich&eacute;-ish message.) There are so many books out there that deal with this same topic, and because of this common subject matter, a novelist needs to be truly inventive to create a real masterpiece. This book should not be ranked anywhere near the top 100 novels on the Modern Library Association's list of the best novels of the 20th century.	2002-01-24

This seemingly short book about a group of boys marooned in an island has more to it than simple adventures.  It does not only shows how each boy (of varying ages) responds to his predicament, but also deals with man's nature & the society through symbolisms.<br />It is inate in us to differentiate good & evil, & this characteristic is further strengthened by the society's norms.  Ralph represents our logical side which is continuously governed by reason (\\"Piggy\\").  Both Ralph & Piggy embody our continuous search for civilization & order.  However, also inate in us, is a brewing desire to do what we really want, no matter how unjustly or incorrect it is.  Jack portrays this aggressive behavior.<br />In an ideal environment, it is common for men to have desires but these can only be manifested & carried it out if they comply with society's set rules.  However, this is not the usual case.  The catastrophe faced by the boys only magnifies society's imperfections.  These ills cannot be easily cured on a superficial level.  The success or breakdown in society can all be traced to man's inner stability.	2002-01-24

Perhaps it is because of my age, I'm nearing 23, that I find this work so, to quote someone from the board, atrocious.<br />This book is absolutely boring and hadn't it been for my friend's reference, I would not have bought iT!!! The setting is an island; the cast is a bunch of stranded 6 to 13 year olds. The major characters are Jack Merridew (the bully), Piggy (the dweeb) and Ralph (The chief and someone in between).<br />Lord of the Flies is a journey of civilised minds turning savage. Everything starts off hunky dory as the children realise they have the whole island to themselves and that no adult is there to govern their behaviour. Everything begins in a civil manner: a leader is chosen (Ralph), the hunters are elected (Jack is the leader of the hunters) and priorities are set (that of making smoke so that nearby ships may spot them, and obtaining meat).<br />Of course, these are nascent minds deprived of a social structure, technology and a family system and so they eventually succumb to savagery.<br />This could have been a fantastic psychological story; one that I feel could have attracted a reader from any generation. Unfortunately, more ink is spent on giving visual descriptions of the island and rocks and reeds than it is on the actual story. Coming to the descriptions, they are fantastic and perhaps the only feature of the novel worthy of merit, though I did think sometimes that Sir Golding should have let my imagination fill in some of the bits too.<br />No matter how much sophistry one may use, no matter how much we may wish to incorporate Freud and Jung and whomever else, I feel the story rushed too quickly. Sir Golding did our work of visualising the island but burdened us with the responsibility of making all the important decisions regarding character developments.<br />Take, for example, the killing of a beast/a pig. The reader was deprived of the feelings the youngsters (Jack, Roger etc) must have gone through when they were contemplating killing a beast, skinning it, stabbing it and running the sharp tools across its throat. They are children for God sake, they wouldn't just go out there and start killing. What would have driven children to kill another animal? Not much stress was placed upon hunger, the driving force behind all of this.<br />This is just one example but the readers will find other examples too, as they go through the chapters.<br />I feel this story could have tapped into something spectacular but with 120 thousand words...maybe not.

Lord of the Flies dealt with changes that the boys (representing society in general) underwent as they gradually adapted to the isolated freedom from society (society's adaptation to the times). Three main characters depicted different effects on certain individuals under those circumstances.<br />Jack Merridew began as the arrogant and self-righteous leader of a choir. The freedom of the island allowed him to further develop the darker side of his personality as the Chief of a savage tribe.<br />Ralph, a &quot;fair haired boy&quot; started as a self-assured boy whose confidence in himself came from the acceptance of his peers. At first, his reliance upon Piggy for advice helped him maintain an orderly society. As the story progressed, it became apparent that the boys' desire for an orderly society fell wayside as the totalitarian Jack took control.<br />Piggy was an educated boy who had grown up as an outcast. Due to his academic childhood, he was more mature than the others and retained his civilized behavior. But his experiences on the island gave him a more realistic understanding of the cruelty possessed by some people.<br />The transition from civilized beings to a barbaric tribe illustrates Golding's view on society in his time. He believed that if we are not careful, we could revert back less sophisticated times and become animals again.	2001-12-13

This book falls into many of the &quot;listmania&quot; lists of other books that I found to be quite good.  So, I had it delivered and found it to be the worst book I've read in a few years.  What do people see in this?<br />I'll grant the fact that there is some nice symbolism with the conch, the boar head, and such.  But that is all it has going for it.<br />Golding attempts to show the reader how easily mankind can become corrupted when left to their own devices, but the story he masked it with is pretty poor.  For something written as recent as 1950, I would have expected much better.<br />First off, there is no mention of what happened to the plane.  Just some boys on an island and the plane crash just seemed to be a way to get them there.  There is no wreckage to deal with, no dead bodies smelling up the island.  Secondly, there is no time reference at all.  It seems that the kids hair just grew long, magically overnight.  Without any mention to a timeframe, it appears they are on the island about a week.  I'm sure it was longer, because nobody should have as little faith in humankind to think that we should devolve to savages so quickly.  Maybe Golding did think it could happen that fast... I don't know.<br />I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who really enjoys reading and likes to see the plot and the characters well developed.  This seemed to be thrown together with no regard to the plot whatsoever.  If this book comes on a recommended list, but there are other options, AVOID THIS ONE!	2001-12-11

A group of young boys crash on an island, and one thing becomes clear immediately: only one can be the leader.  I think this competition between two factions is accurate and exciting.  The struggle becomes so fierce towards the end of the book, it got my adrenaline flowing just reading it.  I don't think the book has to constantly be interpretted as 'democracy vs. anarchy' or in terms of decent society vs. brutal savagery.  The book can be simpler than that if you, as the reader, want it to be.  Just a note:  I think the most important character was Simon.  Keep an eye on him as you read, I haven't quite figured him out yet.	2001-12-06

Symbolism is nice and quite beautiful in some places and for certain writers, but this book had WAY too much of it. Golding's novel is very horrendous in the fact his absolutely mind-numbing style immediately drove me away in his tedious and unnecessary description that wasn't even striking in any way. I'll give it a bit for having good description in a few places, but only a miniscule few.<br />But that isn't even the reason for this rating. What I found most unpleasantly apalling was the content of this so-called classic. It completely and utterly disappointed me in its horrific plot that I wouldn't even care to mention. Am I a happy-go-lucky reader? No; In fact, I quite often enjoy the sad and angry scenes in many novels, but an element of this one that I still can't quite name and don't care to that made those scenes so obtuse. This book should be completely wiped off and eradicated from the lists of classics to read and analyze in schools.	2001-11-30

The plot is quite interesting. It's about 2 planes filled with British kids crashing on a deserted island. First of all, these kids would have died in a few weeks at the most! There is NO way normal men could kill wild boars, let alone young kids. Weapons are hard to make too, I don't know how the older young boys, around the age of 13, can make weapons that is sufficient and adequate enough to use for killing wild boars and other fierce creatures. This book is extremely far-fetched as I see it. But there are interesting elements too, I suppose. It's very symbolical. There's some symbols that I didn't fully interpret until I look into them closer, and I thought that was quite intriguing. It brings a more dark atmopshere into this book. One star for symbolism, and another one is to be respective for the effort of this book being made.	2001-11-24

It is easy to see why teachers love it so much: the symbolism and thematic sense are simple and easily accessible.  Like Of Mice and Men and To Kill a Mockingbird, it is an easy introduction into digging more out of a book than just a good story.  And, also like those books, the story is good enough to keep kids -- and adults-- reading.<br />So does it hold any appeal for an adult, used to digging around in Joyce or Faulkner?  Well, to be honest, To Kill a Mockingbird is still one of my favorite books, and sometimes it's nice when you don't have to try too hard.  In this book, an experienced eye can pretty much see what's going to happen from the very beginning, and then what is left is to sit back and enjoy the ride.  And it is a pretty good ride, a pretty ripping little bloody story.<br />I have some issues with the basic thematic material, wondering how and why (or even if) Golding really believes that grownups or law and society or really anything else really do tame the savage beast that is allowed reign on the island.  When the soldier shows up at the end, is it really over?  If I had the time, talent, and permission, it would be intriguing to write a sequel -- in which Jack and Ralph go the same boarding school and must deal with what happened on the island -- and, in the end, find that there is as much savagery living within the structures of civilization as there ever was on the island.<br />I actually listened to this book, on tape, rather than reading it.  I was fortunate enough to find a copy read by the author himself, with a short commentary by Mr. Golding at the end of every chapter.  Very fun, and recommended. (...)	2001-11-20

William Golding writes this novel with the theme of conflict consistant throughout the story.  It is the same conflict that all human beings experience everyday.  The conflict between two impulses:  the instinct to live by rules, act peacefully, follow the moral commands, and value the good of the group versus the instinct to selfishly satisfy your own desires, act violently to gain control, and enforce your will on others in your group.  One is devoted to values that promote order, and the other is devoted to values that threaten order.  Throughout the novel, the conflict between good and evil is the driving force on human beings by the civilization.  He states that when people are left to do what they chose, they are more likely to become cruel, wild and evil.<br />  Another literary devise used by Golding in The Lord of the Flies is that of symbolism.  Symbols are objects, characters, figures or colors used to represent abstract ideas or concepts.  One of the symbols is the conch shell.  It is one of the first things that they find on the island and they use it to summon the boys together.  The shell became a sign of civilization.  It was used to control the meeting the boys held, the boy who holds the shell is given the right to speak.  As evil takes the shell looses its power among the boys.<br />  One of the most important symbols in the novel is the imaginary beast, which frightens all of the boys.  All of the boys are afraid of the beast, this symbolizes the fear that each one of us has inside of us.  As the boys become more and more evil and against civilization the more their belief in the beast grow stronger.<br />  Another symbol is The Lord of The Flies.  The Lord of The Flies is the bloody sow's head that Jack beats with a stick in the forest as an offering to the beast.  This symbol becomes more important when Simon confronts it in the glades and it speaks to him, telling him that evil lies in every human being.  The Lord of he Flies becomes a symbol for evil or the devil and Simon represents Christ.  It symbolizes the natural instinct of power and the cruelty that takes over.<br />  The characters and objectives in The Lord of The Flies represtents the novel's main theme or ideas.

One of the numerous required reading for us in school, it is memorable to me for the simple reason that this work, on one level is a semi-adventure but on a deeper level, is a symbolic narrative open to many interpretations--moral, psychological, political, social--which created a lively discussion in class. I can now better appreciate it as an adult. It is about a group of schoolboys, marooned on an island and in due time turns savages. Golding's pessimistic premise was that left to ourselves, mankind would regress to barbarism and savagery--a very grim view of the nature of man. But he didn't want to be realistic about it because Golding calls his books fables. He was a school teacher (that may perhaps serve as another reason why this was required reading for a majority of schools) and his World War II experiences in the Navy and years teaching small boys have helped to shape his philosophical attitudes. It was very much evident in the &quot;Lord&quot; as this was his first symbolic novel.<br />The major idea of the novel is that evil is part of human nature (so forget about the idea of ending all wars) but not of civilization which is an absolute must to restrain humans. He wanted to stress the parallelism between the adult and children's world and that both have the capacity to destroy: the boys the island, the adults nuclear war (remember, this was first published in 1954--when the Cold War was in full swing). Golding criticizes the idea that science can explain everything but Piggy believes that science explains everything, that there is no evil except the ones created by troublemakers. And yet Piggy participates  in Simon's murder and was not very convincing when he would not accept his own guilt. As for the 'noble savage' living happily in the wilderness as described by the French writer Jean-Jacques Rousseau, uncorrupted by civilized life--Golding attacks Rousseau's belief that humans in their natural surroundings are rational and good and that society corrupts humans. On the contrary, according to Golding...civilization is needed for saving man from their brutish, destructive instincts.<br />The novel has so many numerous overtones and symbolism, which needs a certain level of maturity in order to be appreciated. And so after many years have elapsed I find it now more engrossing than ever. If you want to be entertained but at the same time challenged...this is the book to read.upts humans.

It had a very good hook. The plot was great too. Ralph is the protagonist of the novel who at first is overjoyed to be on a tropical island free from adult restraints. To express his<br />excitement, he stands on his head, foreshadowing the topsy-turvy nature of things to come. By nature, he is an innocent, mild-tempered boy who accepts leadership when it is thrust on him. He uses a conch shell to mildly show his authority.  He thinks of building shelters to protect them and a signal fire for their rescue. He befriends Piggy, the fat boy that receives taunts and teases from the other boy, and learns to rely on Piggy's intellectual reasoning. Jack Merridew is Ralph's antagonist in the novel. When he is first seen on the island, he is leading a group of choirboys, who are dressed in strange uniform and march military style. It is a foreshadowing of Ralph's authoritarian and dictatorial leadership at the end of the novel. During the novel, Jack is in constant conflict with Ralph, because he feels he should be the leader. There were some very interesting things in this book that kept me interested.  When they found the dead parachuter it really got my attention because I thought it was the lord of the flies.  When piggy gets killed with the rock it made me mad but I survived.  When Simon came running back to tell the other boys what he discovered and they all killed him it was depressing.  There was so much death and hate in this book.  I really see how it stood for the real life situations.  This book is one of the best ones I have ever read.  I am especially glad I read it because it was assigned to me to read one of the years before but I never read it.  I never used to read books for school.  I am so glad I read this book, it is one of the best books I have ever read.  And I had to read it really fast.	2001-11-02

A bunch of boys crash into a deserted island and slowly become very primitive.  When Jack separates the boys into two different tribes, they transform from civil to barbaric.  The two groups begin to turn on one another.  Farther into the book, the fighting increases and the tribes really start to break away from one another.<br />The point of this book is that mankind thinks that their society is civilized, but it is still very primitive.  The world today is still based on survival; the strong overcome the weak.  Even now, one angry word and our society becomes barbaric. Sometimes wars start and friendships end just by saying the wrong words.  As each day passes, the boys start to destroy one another.  Simple words between some of the boys end up agitating the tribes, and battles ensue.<br />The Toronto School Board banned this classic from all its schools, citing that it was racist for use of the word &quot;niggers.&quot;  As I was looking at all the banned books, I noticed how many are banned for their language.  I understand some of this language is harsh, but that is how society acts.  These words help to express the anger the tribes are feeling.  Without these words the reader will never fully understand the hatred between the tribes.	2001-10-28

It was full of suspense, problems, and super-hit characters.  The conflict between the boys and who was going to be the leader was quite alarming.  One of the characters most picked on, Ralph was indeed my favorite because he was the smartest and should have been the leader of the group of youngsters.  This book was great because it was unique and still mellow enough so the reader does not get confused.  I enjoyed the tone of this novel, it seemed very real and calm.  I also liked the creativity of the author and how he showed the savageness that can be within every person by the scene when the boys all kill the wild boar and put his head on a stick....  The end was a dynamic ending.  I liked reading this book and I deeply recommended it to any none-fiction lovers.	2001-10-18

You won't find anything plainly terrifying, like monsters or ghosts or aliens.  What you find is the human instinct, bared for all to see--perhaps most distubingly--in twelve year-old boys, who have their lives ahead of them and who are tomorrow's society.<br />The critical reading of this novel can identify jabs aimed at every human institution:  Morality, Government, Religion, Sociality, every man's internal bloodlust.  And nothing is safe from Golding's incriminating finger that accurately points out mankinds failings.<br />Perhaps the most startling aspect of this novel is how TRUE it is.  We see as the boys parade around the island, making one mistake after another and then creating more; what hits home is the fact that we can identify.  We can look at the jealous pathos of Jack, and we know what he is going through.  We might even encourage him, because he isn't acting outside of the average human's desires, though he is acting irresponsibly.<br />Golding's book takes no prisoners, when it comes to his critique of humanity, and you won't finish the novel with a pleasant feeling in your stomach, but that, perhaps, is the intention, to recognize all that is wrong, all that depraves us, all that increases our downword spiral, all that makes our pompous idea of &quot;civilization&quot; appear absurd and completely unfounded.  Golding certainly does not think that these inherent problems with humanity can be solved, but his intentions are to help us over our denial.<br />The Lord of the Flies challenges the reader to grasp what he has so long denied, and it does so by showing us the simplest, most allegedly innocent of our species as it tears itself apart without regard to those same &quot;civilized&quot; values that it has so dearly prized for so long.  The Lord of the Flies is a must-read, but be prepared for what you might find; the scariest of all stories lies in your own heart.	2001-10-17

Early on, I was hoping there was something more to the story than just lost boys on an island by themselves.  Once I realized that the basic story was just boys fending for themselves, I enjoyed it more.  It's not an easy book to get through because we can't get too close to the main characters Ralph and Jack.  We know by the end, Jack and his &quot;hunters&quot; have gone too far, but somehow I never felt the panic or emotion that Ralph and Piggy probably did.  But the story is fascinating just on the merits of human nature.  Everyone should take that away after finishing this story - people can be broken down into basic personality elements.	2001-10-06

Perhaps it uses the Robinson Crusoe idea of isolation.<br />I do think, as inspirational as Lord of the Flies has been, that it's an overblown, overrated affair and that Golding wrote other more powerful works, such as Darkness Visible. The problem for me lies in the difficulties of using children as main characters while writing from an adult point of view. Difficult to relate to, harder to realistically decribe a child's feelings and emotions because, psychologically, the author is on another level (even though the novel's fiction). On the other hand, Golding's style is attractively fluent in that you want to find out what happens next and that's always a good sign for a classic read.	2001-10-04

While it might have some important messages and symbolism, it is all buried too deep between the lines.  It projects the problems of society onto a group of boys plane wrecked on an abandoned island; in the beginning they all attempt to survive and use the resources that are available, but as they continue to be marooned on the island, their little society becomes corrupted as they become violent and manipulative. The multiple plots, many characters, and headache-inducing descriptions all made this book tedious and unpleasant to read, especially since I had to do so unwillingly for school.  I found the fact that the author had to use symbolism for every point he wanted to make, such as the boys turning into monsters, and the pig's skull, got really tiring and boring to read.  While this book is considered a classic and I suppose it has its relevancy after all these years, I would not reccomend wasting your time on it.	2001-10-01

Golding's work can be viewed from so many different perspectives.  Some people see his work as just a fictional story written for pure enjoyment.  Others view his work as ridicule to British society and government.  Still others see his work as a message of what he believes human nature really is, evil.  I believe the latter of the three ideas.  Golding was trying to reveal to his readers that he believed a society without rules and regulations would lead to a world of true human nature, in his ideas that would be evil.  In the story the deserted boys at first do not know what to do. The two eldest boys Ralph and Jack decide that their needs to be a leader and that leader should be chose by a vote.  They also decide their needs to be rules and punishment for when the rules are not followed.  The ideas that the boys have prove that Golding's idea that they are still restricted from being their true selves because of society's conditioning.  As we proceed we see that the some of the children are less apt to being  \\"good\\" because the restraints that society has put on them has been lifted.  Some children without society are now running wild and acting like savages; the island is in complete chaos.  Some of the boys are still trying to keep order and in turn we get the battle of \\"good versus evil.\\"  In the end the boys are rescued because of this battle; the island is set on fire and because of the flames they are noticed and rescued.  The book is wonderfully written and has so many more meanings then I have even mentioned.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for either a leisure book or a book that they can analyze.  The novel is such a classic because it allows the reader to make his or her own choice about what the book really is about.	2001-09-24

But, unlike all the other books they made us read, I ended up loving this one.<br />The story is essentially a parody of Ballantyne's The Coral Island, which I read when I was much younger, and hated for exactly the same reasons Golding seems to have hated it when he decided to write Lord of the Flies. After reading books like The Coral Island, it's easy to understand the statement the author is making about British society, which is very amusing from a young Canadian perspective (weren't the British silly?).<br />The book is very clever, amusing and moving. And it's not even very long, so it doesn't get boring before getting to the point.<br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who isn't overly squeamish. (It does involve certain acts of violence and cruelty, which tend to be the most important parts.)<br />However, though it isn't necessary, I would recommend reading The Coral Island before Lord of the Flies, in order to understand and enjoy this book to it's fullest.	2001-09-12

This book is like most revolutions that took place this century - at first, all is happy with the new liberal government, but eventually greed takes over the hearts of the leaders of the goverment, and promises turn to propoganda, and the new government is worse than the old one. In &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, Jack and Ralph emerge as the two leaders, and both of them take advantage of their intellegance and use it upon themselves to take responsibility of creating order and prevent jubior schoolboys' anarchy. Jack is the leader of the hunters, who gather meat for the tribe to eat. Ralph is responsible for the part of the tribe that is to build shelter, and to keep the fire alight. As their faith in being rescued is abandoned, they become the inhabitants of the island that they are plane wrecked on. At first, there is food for everyone, all the boys are equal and happy, enjoying the tropical climate, swimming in the lagoons, and mainly their freedom from adults. But conflict between jack and Ralph is soon aroused, and the tribe splits into two. The two tribes become rivals untill all that is left of Ralphs tribe has gone to jacks side, and what is left is Ralph and Piggy. Soon, the schoolboys are haunted by the vision of a huge beast living in the caves of the island, and this fear provokes the schoolboys to become like savage-like animals, killing and toruring the boys who disobey their leader, Jack. Piggy tries to persuade the boys to come back to reality, and to depart from their aim to destroy the &quot;beast&quot; which they have invisioned, but the boys are too anarchiac to listen.

Golding just says too much on too many different levels. The book is simply brilliant. First off, Lord of the Flies is an adventure story. A few British schoolboys are deserted on an island and must depend on themselves to survive to be rescued. The story is based on an earlier British classic, The Coral Island by R.M. Ballantyne. The simple adventure story is used to comment on humanity. Golding, much like Joseph Condrad, shows how civilation keeps humanity from lapsing into savagery. He presents the schoolboys' loss of innocence. Lord of the Flies is also a political treatise much like Animal Farm. Ralph represents a democracy, Jack is communism, and Piggy is the voice of wisdom which both tends to ignore. He traces political troubles back to individuals.<br />Many people think of William Golding as too pessimistic about human nature. I do not think Golding was as pessimistic as many think. William Golding was unfortunate to see human at its worst during World War II, and I think he feared lapses. Lord of the Flies is his warning. His attempt to help man stay on the right course. Whether or not a person agrees to this and feels Golding was too cynical, it is impossible to not think of Lord of the Flies as one of the best-written books of the century. Golding encompasses so much into an simple, powerful narrative. The prose and images are beautiful even when grim. Lord of the Flies is certainly one of the great novels of literature.	2001-07-19

This book is a must-read for everybody, especially if they try to understand human nature, the basis of society and action and why people behave the way they do.<br />I highly recommend this ground-shattering book. Everytime you re-reading the book, one finds a new layer of understanding. How the social codes develop, how we are living in the illusion of safety and education and to which degree this is embodied inside us. This book will certainly scare many people by showing them how strong our instincts, and ID are, with a dangerously convincing style.	2001-07-14

However, as I explored this novel further I became more comfortable with the style and learned to appreciate everything this book has to say. The theme of basic human nature leading to the destruction of a society is illustrated very strongly in this novel, and I like how the author presented this. Despite the fact that all the characters are children, Golding has managed to create strong and interesting characters that paralllel many people in politics we see today. A worthy read and an instant classic, the only reason for the 4 stars is that some people may not appreciate Mr. Golding's writing style.	2001-07-11

In &quot;polite&quot; society today this is largely masked and the aggressor does not literally kill the weak, but subdues, dominate etc by economic power.	2001-07-09

After all, I had only heard great things about it.  However, I was extremely disappointed once I ventured on to read past the first chapter.  Slowly, I progressed onward, making my way through endless descriptions, multiple plots, and enough symbolism to make my head ache.  I think Mr.Golding should have remembered that not ONLY are themes important to keep the reader's interest, but PLOT is too.  This book is an excellent example of how someone can get so lost in the hidden meaning of their words, they forget what they're trying to SAY in the first place.  Not only are their problems with the actual structure of the book, but also in the language used.  There is a wide variety of slang used, which is, for the most part, chiefly British! I found myself rereading sentences more than two times just to understand what was being said.  By half-way through the book, I actually wanted to stop and start reading something else.  Also, throughout the book, Mr.Golding leaves off on one note and starts a completely different series of events.  By the end of the book there are so many plots going on, it gets old trying to follow which one is going on at the moment.  So, in summary, if you want to read a book which has multiple plots, too much symbolism, and descriptions to put you to sleep, then Lord of the Flies is for you.	2001-07-05

This is the book of dreams for any English teacher who loves to get their students to read between the lines. Personally, I enjoy a book that is a challenging read, but in this book, every little detail meant something &quot;deeper&quot; and it gave me a headache trying to interpret the aspect of society the detail was trying to depict.

This book does just that perfectly. At the beginning of the book, nearly all as well. The turning point is the slaughter of a pig, an event whose symbolism can become more clear later.

At this moment, while I'm writing this review there were 632 reviews more, so, why to write another? Just because I have just reread the novel and I feel the necessity to share some ideas. First, although only three boys die out of many (we never know exactly how many boys live in the island)this novel is about &quot;horror&quot; just as it is in The Heart of Darkness by Conrad. Second, all characters are male characters. That is very important in the novel, I think. Try to speculate about the same novel, the same island, the same problems faced by the boys but mixed with female characters. In that case you could go to the extremes: a love story or a double horror story. Third, if you have read Blindness by Saramago you will find many curious and interesting similitudes. Put a group of persons under extreme conditions (boys abandoned on an island or a whole country infected by a new kind of blindness) and you will have the perfect situation for the surgement of &quot;the beast&quot;, that thing so inmersed into human soul that is always trying to get out of the cage of &quot;civilization&quot;. Anyway, Lord of the Flies is a superb novel and it will keep producing many new ideas into quite different minds.	2001-06-18

When you put a group of people on an island you are going to have the one that wants to be the leader with rules,laws, and punishment. And there will be one who wants to have anarchy, freedom, and no violence. When the kids were put on the island they had everything in order until one person started to get ahead of the pack and wanted to do things his way and start his own group.... they either go with the one who is smart or the one that wants to go live wild. The book didn't realy catch my attention until I had to read it for school. Thats when I started to think of it and pay attention to the book. After we read the book in class, we watched the movie. It wasn't as good as the novel, but it gave me more of an idea of what the island and kids looked like. Many of the actions taken in the book were wrong and taught kids that its ok to hurt or kill someone. When the little boy was stabbed to death the night of the feast it was alright because they thought it was the beast.  But when they found out it wasn't the beast they still had no feelings or regrets.  When piggy was trying to get his glasses back from the Ralphy's group he was crushed with a bolder and killed.  The kids intentially killed this boy and had no regrets.  Many of these kids even turned to Ralphy when they saw he had food and shelter. The kids left the good group to go to the bad one and tryed to kill there old leader. At the end all the kids turned against the good and tryed to kill him and he was saved by a man who took him away from the island, but the book I gave four stars just for the simple fact that its suppoesed to be for kids and yet its telling you its ok to kill. Other than that the book is great and easy to read.  There isn't that many big words so its kool.	2001-06-12

There's more than just an innocence lost thing in it -like the choir leader, Jack, becoming the most evil on the island.  I think Golding meant to imply that innocence is an illusion, as shallow as the choir boys' outfits.  Being a substitute teacher for both high school and middle school, I would vouch Golding's implications hold true even for kids who aren't lost on desserted islands.  Ultimately, the island signifies a pre-adolescent's experience, as being cut off from the world while admist a wild sway of new emotions.  I'm glad this book exists, because peopel need access to eloquent articulation of youth's experiences.	2001-06-05

It repeatedly reoccurs throughout our pop culture, in television and film, etc.  I am not sure if Darwinism came before or after this book, but the principal idea is what happens when several human beings have to survive on a remote island far removed from society.  The book begins with a plane crash of school children, and the surviving children attempt to establish some form of order which quickly disintegrates.  What happens from there is indicative of William Golding's impression of the true, primal nature of humanity.  Definitely a classic, which everyone should read.  If not, there is a really good b&amp;w film which follows the book pretty accurately.	2001-06-01

In fact, there are dozens. Second of all, Golding was an English schoolmaster who understood how children behaved. The idea that he was not qualified to write about children's behavior is ludicrous. One reviewer is partially correct when he states that children rarely attack each other. They rarely attack each other IN THE PRESENCE OF AUTHORITY. Finally, society could have developed with human nature the way that Golding presents it because human brains were developed to allow us to interact socially with other humans. Society would have then been made up of fifty to a hundred people, and authority would have been present, too.<br />Having said all that, the only reason why you could not like this book is if you absolutely did not understand it. The Lord of the Flies might not have changed my life, but it really was a GREAT book. Its symbolism is poignant, clear, and powerful. The message the book gets across is wonderful.<br />This dark, somewhat disturbing book is absolutely worth reading, and a copy belongs on the shelf of every serious reader. Each time I have read it I have come up with new meanings that I missed the previous time and it never gets old.<br />If you know how to read it, it is definitely NOT boring. Be prepared for a wonderfully written, powerful book about the darker side of human nature.	2001-04-25

I enjoyed it somewhat.<br />It is a good plot concept in general, with lots of opportunity for analysis and psychological scrutiny. However, oftentimes I had a difficult time believing that the characters were children, because they seemed to behave a little too adult for their age. The writing was a bit verbose for my tastes, although not excessively so. Because of this, it didn't suck me into it's world entirely, and it wasn't something that I was very enthusiastic about finishing, except to find out how it ends.<br />Overall, this is worth reading if you have any curiosity about it, but it may take some determination to get through it.	2001-04-11
US	45278875	RVRQ35M8HLYXE	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Lord of the flies is a book of symbolism	When a plane carrying a bunch of school boys crashes into an uninhabited Island, the pilot is killed and the young boys are left to fend for themselves. Immediately two leaders arise. The democrat (Ralph) and the dictator (Jack), the traits that the boys portray and the way all of the boys on the island treat each other is very much a microcosm of the society and world  of America and Nazi Germany in WWII. Another bit of symbolism is with the Bible and the idea of the character Simon as a Christ figure. He is the prophet throughout the book. He warns the boys that the beast they all fear on the island is really the inherant evil of man within them, not something you can hunt and kill. He confronts the lord of the flies (a pigs head on a stick), and though he is threatened, he goes back to the boys to warn them that the beast is really them. He gives his life to preach this truth. Also the comparison of Jack with the serpant, he lures the boys away with promises of fun times an food, but he really leads them into sins like murder and greed.  I think that this is a great literary classic., and has much to teach and understand in it. No matter wich way you take it this is a must read for all classic literature lovers.	2001-04-08

I am 26 years old now and still think about the morality and symbolism of human nature I discovered in &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;.  I decided to write this review all these years later after watching the first installment of the TV show &quot;Survivior&quot;.  I saw a lot of similarities.  In &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; we are given a sort of scenario...what if a group of young adolescent boys were left abandoned on a deserted island.  This is what happens...and as I describe some of the scenes from the book, compare them to that of a real life TV show a lot of us watch.  Maybe like me, you'll see a more animal, evil side to these &quot;real-life&quot; strategy survival shows.  On this deserted island a natural leader is born, Ralph.  He is kind, and  understanding of the fears his fellow students face.  He accepts responsibility and delegates &quot;chores&quot; for the other boys to do.  They must tend a rescue fire. They must hunt for food. They must tend to the wounded pilot.  Ralph chooses the path a responsible adult might. Soon some of the boys become lazy. They do not follow Ralph's rules. These unruly boys are headed by another natural leader. The more &quot;wild&quot; and fun-seeking Jack.  Jack and Ralph argue.  To maintain control the boys find a large shell ....the conch....and whoever holds it has the right to speak.  This attempt at order works for a little while but soon Jack dismisses the control the conch holds.  He and his pig-hunting, lazy friends split from the original group and leave to another part of the island. They want to &quot;do their own thing&quot;. They defy rules and organization which Ralph feels is the key to survival. Meanwhiile Ralph and his friend Piggy struggle to keep their small group in order.  It becomes increasingly difficult to maintain adult responsibility.  For the youngest who fear Jack and his clan, Ralph becomes almost their savior, their security on an island of unknown.  Soon Ralph's pack decides they too are tired of rules, and one by one leave to join Jack's ideas of senseless fun.  Jack represents abandonment of control, living purely through pleasures.  This is where you can form a million metaphors between the two clans of boys.  Jack and his bandits become so wild and animal-like near the &quot;end&quot; that they actually start hunting Ralph in the manner of a real pig-hunt.  They have forgotten society, basic humanity, and most of all..they have forgotten they were once all friends.  This kind of behavior echoed alot of the back-stabbing things I see on TV and in the government, religion, everywhere in real life.  Read this book and never let yourself abandon what you truly beleive to be good in your heart...Let us compare this book of instinct and leaders and followers to our own lives....On a personal note....Jack always kind of reminded me of Adolph Hitler and his control over his followers during the war.  I would love to hear some other thoughts via e-mail.  If you are reading this book for school, like I did once, really try to think about some real-life comparisons you find between the pages of Golding's work of art.on Ralph's pack decides they too are tired of rules, and one by one leave to join Jack's ideas of senseless fun.

Just what I need, another half hour of homework added to my very busy schedule.  And to make matters worse my satanic English teacher was going to make us, the students teach the book.  Well it turns out that the Lord of the Flies was not just another half hour of homework.  It was insight into the dregs of human nature,  the secret thoughts that we pretend not to think. It basically places a group of boys onto an idyllic island, adds a few pigs, some firewood, a pair of glasses, a conch, a parachutist and a generous dose of fear and savagery inherent to all humans, and documents what happens.  It is a deceptively simple storyline that makes the reader examine him/herself more closely than s/he otherwise would.  On the journey important questions are raised,and in the quest for answers to them I learned fundamentally important facts about myself in this period of teenage rebellion.  What is survival worth? What is the cost of human advancement? How is it that our society we created is the only thing protecting us from are inherent savagery?  Would I kill someone in that situation? Who am I?	2001-03-31

I do agree on this theme becuase I don't think everyone is &quot;good&quot;. I believe everyone does something that is evil. Although, some people have it in them more than others. I think the author used a lot of description which made it really boring. He also used too much violence, which in my opinion, only made it worse. I think this can happen to anyone who is in a plane crash. Being in this situatuion can get your mind crazy and make you do weird things, like the boys did. If it was me who wrote the book, I would use less description becuase is made it boring. I would also make it less vioent.	2001-03-21

The message is there is evil inside everyone.  I do not agree with this message because Simon was pure good. The literary element I think he used best is symbolism because he used it alot. I think this book is very believable because there is evil in some boys, and those boys will do crazy things.  There is only one thing I don't like about this book. I think Jack or Roger should of die or really get hurt.	2001-03-21

I agree with his message because it informs you of how cruel people can be. I think the literary element the author handled best was the characters. They were very well described by their looks as well as their actions. This book was believable because the way the story was written, because it has real personalities as real people. For example, when people are in a group they change to fit in, just like the characters in the story they all became savages. This book was &quot;less than perfect&quot; because it didn't have any girls and the ending was not very elaborate either. I would fix the flaws by adding more things, like girls to see how they would react and be more elaborate in the ending. If I were to rate this book it would be fair.	2001-03-21

The type of person that I think that would like the book the most is the adventurous type.I think the purpose for writing the book was to show that without authority, there would be total chaos. I agree with the message because when the kids got used to not having a parental figure around they did what they wanted. The element that was handled best was the climax because of how detailed he explained every thing that was going on. This book was very believable because you're always hearing about people getting into plane crashes and they were standed on an island for a long period of time and they had to use a lot of survival skills.The book was less than perfect because in the middle of action Golding jumps to something totally different. I would fix these flaws by continuing until the action is over. All in all this book was an ok book to read.	2001-03-21

He wanted to let us know what it would be like to be free without rules and authority.  I think Golding handled setting and symbolism best out of all the literary elements in the book.  He described the island so good it makes you visualize what it looks like.  Golding also used lots of symbolism helping to explain why certain things happened in the story.  Golding wanted to show how young boys would react to being alone and in charge of themselves.  It is a good book and enjoyable..I encourage you to read it if you like semi adventure and realism.	2001-03-21
US	44704183	R1YFB1FPWVLS8Z	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	2	0	1	N	N	Ok	I think that the authors purpose for writing this was to send a message that there is evil in all men. I agree with him because the boys expressed it after they lost respect for eachother. They all showed some kind of evil on the island. The literary element that the author showed was symbolism. He handled it very well because it made you want to keep reading to see if his symbolism was true or not. In my opinion, this book was believable because imagine being on the for six to nine months. the boys went crazy thinking about how long they were going to survive which of course made the evil come out in them. The book was less than perfect in the ending. I probably would have had some cops investigate on why some of the boys that were dead looked the way they did.  That would have been my way of changing the flaws.	2001-03-21

At first I didn't like it but when everything started happening I really started to enjoy the book. My teacher also made the book very fun to read becasue she put alot of energy into it. The more energy you use to read the book the better it is. The only thing I disagreed with in the book was that Ralph was the leader. I thought with the help of Ralph,Piggy would have been the best leader because he was the smartest one in the group. I also think Golding did a good job writing this book. He used alot of themes that are in society today,and made me think what if something like that could happen, what would it be like. Trust me if you read this book you will be very impressed.

It just takes a lot to bring it out, some more than others.  I do agree with the author, I believe that there is a little violence in everyone also.  Out of all the literary elements, I think the author handled characterization the best.  He made every character symbolize something.  He even gave them names that had literal meanings, which were actually what each character stood for.  Golding shows excellent characterization skills, in this classic.  I think this book is believable.  This can easily happen, and probably has happened in real life. I don't know if the level of violence would be so extreme.  It is hard to tell because I have never witnessed a situation, in which somebody would have so much fear, that they would become that violent.  If I could, I wouldn't change the book much at all.  Maybe I would change the ending a little bit, in the sense of who died, and who didn't.  I would've probably added some more characters also.  One more thing I would've done is create a game, or form of entertainment that the boys invented, and frequently enjoyed on the island.	2001-03-21

US	44704591	RA3APXJVN1JMS	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	3	0	2	N	N	my overall opinion	In my opinion Golding's reasons for writing this book are to show that there is an inner beast in everyone. I agree with his message because there is a point in everyone's day, or life that their true beast comes out.  The best literary elements that Golding uses were foreshadowing and symbolism. He uses symbolism the best in the way he used Piggy's glasses to reveal a sign of vision. Not just eye-sight but the sight of seeing things clearly. Piggy was the only one on the island that had a clear vision of life and he was also able to see that rules are needed in life for things to work out and for there not to be any serious conflicts.  L.O.F. is a very realistic book because if any number of people were stranded on an island without any rules there would be absolute chaos.  People would be power hungry like Jack. There would be a few people that thought that rules were neccessary to survive, like Piggy.They would eventually turn into worrying about themselves, and getting only what they need to survive in life.  I think the book could have had a better ending.  A reader from LBHS (Long Branch High School)!	2001-03-21

A story of several young boys trapped on a desert island with no adults to control things.  In the beginning the boys want to be organized and stay together, but they also want to have fun.  After all, this island is their paradise, no adults, and no rules.  Soon, their fun turns to chaos and murderous insanity, and the boys are split into two groups:  those who want order and rules, and those who are crazed and just want to have fun.  It's a sad book about the end of innocence, but beautifully and truthfully written.	2001-03-19

Lord of the Flies is a novel about our human nature. Too often I think, people jump to quick conclusions about the book and Golding's stand on human nature. \\"His stance is too pessimistic\\" or \\"That books really gross.\\" What these people fail to realize is that Golding tried to paint a picture of human nature as he saw it. He wasn't making things up, I don't think he was particularly angry, he wrote Lord of the Flies to expose people to the atrocities that he witnessed in World War II.<br />One of the largest underlying principles in Lord of the Flies is of course, human nature. William Golding gives the reader three interesting characters to analyze: Jack, Piggy, and Ralph. It's quite apparent as you read the novel that Golding must have read a little Sigmund Freud before writing Lord of the Flies. Let's start with Jack. Jack is the definite Id on the island. He wants to survive but he also wants to eat meat and have fun. Jack is clearly unable to control these urges and in turn has a pretty large influence on the other boys on the island. Piggy is the definite Superego on the island. Piggy is always referring to \\"well my auntie...\\" and always finds an excuse not to do something. Piggy has no intentions of satisfying his id, and in turn influences only Ralph and Simon. Ralph on the other hand, takes the middle road. He is clearly trying to find a way to satisfy his id, but he can't seem to find one. Take what he said in chapter eight for instance: \\"...Without the fire we can't be rescued. I'd like to put on war-paint and be a savage. But we must keep the fire burning...\\" Ralph is definitely trying to satisfy his id, but those laws of culture still remain with him, telling him it's not the thing a proper English boy should do.<br />Another interesting connection I made while reading, was one between Jack's status of leader and the ideology of Thomas Hobbes. Unlike Hobbes though, Jack's power was used for quite the opposite affect. Hobbes believed that in order for a perfect society to exist, a higher power had to be in charge, in order to keep the other citizens in check. Jack was that higher power on the island. He was in control of everything, however, his power had quite the opposite affect of \\"keeping people in check.\\" Jack used the powerful persuasion of the id to persuade others. Jack could promise meat and fun, whereas Ralph could promise labor and fruit, something the other boys definitely didn't want.<br />Lord of the Flies is also a novel filled with symbolism. Probably the most important of these symbols was the conch. The conchs represented several things, including freedom and order on the island, and possibly, even for a short time, unity between the boys. One of the most interesting aspects to the conch was the fact that Piggy couldn't use it. This shows a lack of leadership or strength on Piggy's part. The conch became a tool of free speech. Those who wanted to speak at the tribal council had to hold the conch in order to be heard. However, as the story progressed, this practice diminished more and more, until the island was a place of complete chaos and anarchy. In one of the last chapters of the novel, the conch gets completely destroyed. This symbolizes two things. First, it symbolizes the end of order on the island- no more meetings, no more assemblies, none of that, the island was a place of anarchy. Secondly, this destruction symbolizes the end of Ralph's leadership. The boys had become slaves to Jack and his power, their conscience gave in.<br />Finally, about the novel itself. Golding is quite obviously a fan of Joseph Conrad. The writing style is almost identical, and the subject matter is very similar, with Golding opting to use children (young boys) instead of the men of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. The novel moves very quickly and it's rather short (202 pages in my copy.) You'll be immersed in thevarying characters and degrees of humanity that they present. Keep in mind, that although Golding's view on humanity may seem very pessimistic, he's writing from his perspective on human nature, something that he witnessed first hand during WWII.n the varying characters and degrees of humanity that they present.

I don't agree with the author because I don't think everyone is born evil. The literary element that I think Golding handled best was the characters. He must of done alot of research on them. The names and the characterists fit well with the story. I think the book was believable because it handles fear, and every child goes through some sort of fear. This fear that they had made the story what it is. I really didn't expect the book to end the way it did. It was a really boring ending. Its like he didn't give the ending any thought, or he ran out of time.	2001-03-13

Leaving all the school reviews behind of foreshadowing and such, I really could associated with all the main characters and see it through thier eyes (except Simon, not much of a mystic myself).  I could feel the power trip of Jack, speak the voice of reason of Piggy, know that it's gone too far like Ralph, and mindlessly follow the masses as a child.  It's IMO, a real reflection of human nature.  READ IT!  As for the reading itself, kinda simplistic, but when talking about kids, shouldn't it be?	2001-03-08

Most teenagers thought it was stupied, but you got to remeber that, that is how life is, there is good and bad people, most peoples like the bad people because they make life seem easyer.

It's interesting to see how cynical a successfull author can be, and how popular such cynicism can be. Lord of the Flies might be a suspenseful and thought-provoking book, but it's main thesis --children turning into beasts as soon as the burden of civilization is taken off them-- is utterly silly. It makes me wonder how many children Mr. William Golding really knew or talked to before writing this book. Children are always capable (many times much more than grownups) to act with common-sense and responsibility. I think Mr. Golding knew this (he can't be that narrow-minded), but simply choose to forget it since it would destroy his thesis and he wouldn't be able to write this novel. It's also fun to see how easily some authors can ignore or blur the most simple realities. I don't recommend this book to anyone who loves children and childhood, which is a period of exploration and friendships.	2001-02-22

We read it in class one day and I started to get sick. We were on Chapter 4 and then I went home. I was sick a whole week, so I know that I missed out on an immense amount of reading. So I got an idea one morning. I told my mom to go buy me the book. She went and purchased it and I begin to catch up on my reading. I really enjoyed this book. I encourage my friends to read this. It was very inspiring. My teacher said that scientists believe that it was based on a true story, but he said they do not have enough evidence to prove that it really happened. In my opinion, I think it couldn't have happened because everyone knew where the boys were traveling to and when the boys came up missing, they could have retraced their route and went back looking for them. This is my review of the book. I attend St. Andrews Middle School and I read this in an AAP Young Literature Class. Now at my age, this book would be considered to a little to old, but I understood it quite well.<br />Audra Williams	2001-02-17
US	52147775	R36GN92QCDXAUD	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Sort of Classic	In the early part of the 20th Century a Englishman called Barry wrote a book called The Coral Island. It involved some children who were cast away in the pacific. Full of British pluck they quickly get organized and build a working civilization on the Island. They are more than equal, the adult natives they meet and have far higher and superior values. They have many adventures and all end in triumph. The book was a hymn to Imperialism and the racist assumptions on which it was based. Pacific Islanders probably still ritually burn it as part of their independence ceremonies.<br />William Golding's book has generally thought to be a response. Golding is apparently a deeply religious man and a number of his later books have religious themes. His theme is probably related his view of the nature of man. Unlike Barry he has a pessimistic view of the nature of man and his tendency for evil. He also starts by having a number of school children marooned on an island. The children are all male and appear to be from wealthy backgrounds. Initially there are attempts to collect food and carry on in a civilized way but things break down. A number of the boys chase pigs and set up a pig's head as a sort of religious shrine in a clearing. Towards the end of the book the group turn violent.<br />Golding's book has been prescribed on school texts for years. Unlike most books set for children to read most of them seem to like it. The imagery is startling and the book is quite short. Golding's other works never quite had the same impact as this one.<br />In retrospect although a readable book it is hard to think that it is really about much at all. The subject of the work is after all just children. It is not surprising that poorly socialized kids placed in a difficult social environment might be at sea. The books main message is probably a historic one putting in context the reality of what people are like and should be read in comparison to Barry's work which suggested a more political view of white people. Despite the fact that the historical impact has declined the book is remarkable easy to read and the imagery is startling. It is probably a good bridge for children to move from kids to adult literature.tical view of white people.

And then we get to the final page, which would be best ripped out.

US	48157968	RQYFCLZAY5RO0	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	5	5	7	N	N	Definitely a boy book...	Which is not to say that girls won't enjoy this too, but when it was published in 1954, `Lord of the Flies' was written in response to the standard literature targeted to boys.  Golding was frustrated with the idealistic, happy-ending-every-time formula, particularly in one book called `The Coral Reef'-there are several cutting references throughout `Lord of the Flies' to this work.  In `Lord of the Flies,' Golding shows us what he feels would *really* happen if a group of boys were left alone on a deserted island.  As the book progresses, we see the boys' attempts at maintaining a civilized society degenerating faster and faster.<br />The plots and ideas introduced present many questions of the reader.  How does a group of British schoolboys, growing up in what they consider the height of civility, turn so readily to savagery?  How does the temptation of power make them forget their goal of rescue so quickly?  How can they so easily dismiss acts of murder?  And, as you read the last three pages and close the book, you wonder...how do they feel about the events that have taken place, afterwards?<br />A better question than \\"how\\" is \\"why.\\"  In the critical note included in the back of the book, there is a quote by Golding that states, in his own words, the theme of `Lord of the Flies':  \\"...an attempt to trace the defects of society back to the defects of human nature...the shape of a society must depend on the ethical nature of the individual and not on any political system however apparently logical or respectable.\\"<br />Given the novel's endurance over time and countless praises by the critics, one would judge that Golding succeeded.  As a reader, you must decided for yourself, but one thing is for sure: This definitely isn't the Hardy Boys, the popular (yet plastic) product of the Stratenmeyer syndicate that, while it has withstood time as well, can't be said to have had an impact on society. Whereas this novel was carefully crafted to be intense and thought provoking, unflinchingly real...not to mention graphic.

After Lord of the Flies was originally released, Golding openly discussed his novel, and stated (paraphrased) that it was all nice and good that the children were rescued, but who will rescue the adults? Golding's comment, in so few words, sums up the whole novel eloquently. The novel truly is about the evil that lurks in people naturally, and that if society is not strong enough, chaos and primitive anarchy will result. In essence, we all need to be rescued. Golding's view is quite different that that of J.J Rousseau, who feels that there existed a noble savage, and that society is to blame for the exisiting problems. A very interesting read, especially the symbolism of the three main characters of Jack, Ralh, and Piggy as Freud's Id, Ego, and Super Ego. Also the character Simon is rather intriguing, as is the fate of Ralph, Simon, and Piggy at the hands of the savages. My question is: Did it matter that they were children, or would adults in the same situation reacted the same? Ponder it...	2001-01-11

So, after a plane crash, only children survive in a remote island. As they struggle to survive, we are witnesses to the undoing of civilization, once some of them, especially Jack, realize that the institutions, strictures and constraints of society are gone. And what we read is certainly frightening: deep inside, we still are savage creatures, bent on getting power and domination over the rest of us. Only Ralph and Piggy keep their will to bring about cooperation and collaboration, as the indispensable way to survival. But the rest won't listen: what they want is to swim and hunt, to play and to fight. The voices of civilization and peace will not only be ignored: they will be denounced and punished. Savagery will triumph over peacefulness. That society will have to start all over again, trodding the path from utmost savagery to civilization. This is not a political or a sociological novel, it is a fable. But something I learned or reinforced from reading it, is that the central beliefs and institutions of our civilization are not to be taken for granted. They need to be constantly nurtured, reinforced and reformed. For our basic instincts are still there, and exactly the way they were thousands of years ago. So, this novel is thrilling, fun to read, and interesting to think about.	2001-01-05

The sorty takes the reader through the horrors of how these boys had to work together to survive and what struggles they went through with each other.  William Golding did a good job of showing how much different people are and what different goals people have.  &quot;Loard Of The Flies&quot; was a quick read for me yet it still made me impatient because the charactures kept repeating themselves.  Ralf, a leader in the book, would always say &quot;we need to keep the fire going.&quot;  Jack, another leader, would always say &quot;we need to hunt.&quot;  Sure the book needed to state this so we could get to know the characters but we didn't need to read these quotes every five minutes  This book was very similar to &quot;Animal Farm,&quot; except it used people instead of animals.  I saw lots of similarites in the two books and how power can get into the wrong hands.  Some people like to abuse their powers and these two books show that really well.  I think people who like to read about government would like this book because it relates to how a country is ran.  Willam Golding did a good job of using description in which he described every little detail, whether it was a person, the island, or what the boys were doing.  &quot;The Bushes crashed ahead of them.  Boys flung themsleves wildly from the pig track and scrabbled in the creepers,screaming.&quot;  This is just one of the many quotes where William Golding uses vivid details.

Think of the Western &quot;High Noon.&quot;  Every line of dialogue was key in revealing the plot.  There was no one standing around and just explaining things, like in &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot;  Things are expounded through actions, through thought, so that every word has meaning, and every meaning, entertainment value.  I'm surprised at those who found it boring.  I can't offer any persuasion -- you have to be willing to read it, and it won't appeal to everyone.  But the reason this book is so terribly disturbing is that it is so &gt;realistic&lt;.  Not to give away any major plot happenings, but recent (within the last year or so) news events only make some of the more grisly things in the book seem closer to home, and therefore more unsettling, which is maybe why a lot of readers found it too shocking to appreciate.

What also left an impression on me was Ralph... at the first of the book he was pliant to the whims of the mob, pleasure-seeking and immature.  By the end he is a leader who laments the loss of innocence and reason. I guess, though I don't usually like books with so much description of the foliage, the reason it is such a worthy book is that I will remember it... I will remember Ralph being manhunted, his fear almost palpable.	2000-12-07

Of us.&quot;	A group of young schoolchildren (all male) are evacuated from Britain in the wake of a nuclear war. As it turns out, their airplane has crashed onto an uninhabited island, with the result that there are no adult survivors to be found. In the opening scenes, children begin to slowly emerge from the forest and converge on the beach at the summons of the book's main character Ralph. As they are now thrust together in this new environment, it becomes apparent that a new sort of social order is going to be necessary. What follows for the length of the book is an elaborate working out of this (attempted) democratic style of social order.<br />After an initial confrontation of two groups on the beach (one led by Ralph, the other led by Jack), Ralph is elected as leader. Early on, we see that Ralph's interests tend to be &quot;group&quot; oriented. His concern is with rescue, and with keeping the others focused on this objective through the maintenance of a signal fire. We see shadows in Jack however, that are more temporal, concerned with the hungry rumble in his stomach. And here we sense the beginnings of conflict, and the age-old fact looming to remind us that, even in democracy we need to recognize submission to elected leadership.<br />In a pivotal chapter (ch.5) one of the children declares &quot;We're drifting and things are going rotten. At home there was always a grown-up.&quot; The significance here is that, by filling his island with castaway children (rather than adults) Golding allows us to consider more aspects of innate or instinctual human nature than if it had been otherwise. Children are raw. If this island were inhabited by castaway &quot;grown-ups&quot; the results and conclusions they came to would be conditioned by all of the ingenuity, resourcefulness, and maturity with which they'd have dealt with previous struggles and needs. Socially, they would have been able to draw upon the results (good or bad) of past decisions made in the clash and clang of more mature inclinations and inhibitions. But children are not afforded this perspective of experience. Golding populates his island with children because he wants to emphasize the full range of possibilities that are INNATE in the human condition, typified in this case by Ralph's tears on the very last page. Tears, we are told, which he wept &quot;for the end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart.&quot;<br />With the frenzied killing of Simon in ch.9 comes the real disintegration; a rapid descent into moral anarchy. Ralph is the only one who dares to say it... &quot;That was murder.&quot; He has the keenest sense of the mob mentality that will inevitably run roughshod over the individual conscience. Earlier than any of the others he understands their own capacity for evil when he says to Piggy, &quot;I'm frightened. Of us.&quot;<br />I had the heartrate of a chased fox in the last chapter... you will too. And when the question was flung out at the end &quot;Who's boss here?&quot;... Ralph's loud cry of &quot;I am&quot; rang through my very soul. Those two words signify the triumph of perception over ignorance.<br />The lasting value of the book is its ability to pose the question &quot;What if I were thrust into a similar situation?&quot; Which character would I most resemble... with whom do I most identify? How is it then, that we in fact, do behave? What if?...<br />This story speaks to any overly optimistic answer to that question when we remember that the entire reason these children found themselves on this island in the first place, was that they were fleeing a nuclear war that &quot;grown-ups&quot; had started.more mature inclinations and inhibitions.

A group of English schoolboys survive a plane crash in a post- nuclear world, to find themselves on a lush, tropical island,  with no apparent dangers and even better-no adults!  Sounds idyllic: no rules, no punishment, no judgment for bizarre behavior. Nor anyone to take responsibility for the &quot;littleuns.&quot;<br />  But social dynamics quickly emerge, as human nature is released from 12 years of training. Thoughtful Ralph is voted Chief, with bespectacled Piggy his second in command.  The right to speak in council is formalized by the possession of &quot;the Conch&quot; shell.  Is it human nature to require rules and ritual?  Their critical need, of course, is to maintain a signal fire (especially the smoke) to attract a passing ship.  For if there is no Hope of rescue, what will happen to this mini outbost of Britian; will they &quot;go native?&quot;<br />  Rivalry increases as Jack--leader of the choir boys turned hunters--challenges Ralph's authority, gradually luring many boys to his tribe which offers disguises and promotes violence.  Will Ralph realize that he needs to rely on both Piggy's logic and Simon's insight?  Could a boy's game disintegrate so quickly into murder?  Can Fear evolve into a hideous primitive religion?  Is it necessary to create a god of sorts?  A gripping tale of the immortal struggle between man's baser instincts and centuries of socialization. A grim must-read for all thinking adults, Lord of the Flies offers great adventure for kids. This is Not a CHILDREN's Classic.	2000-12-05

Before reading the novel I was a staunch believer that humans are intrinsically good; however, Lord of the Flies questioned my stubborn belief, and although I  still believe that humans are inherently good, I am now aware of the opposing arguements and their validity . Lord of the Flies accomplishes such a potent message because we can all relate to the derelicted school boys. We can all relate to Piggy, the one ostracized boy because at times we too are ostracized. By using such familiar themes Golding accomplishes what so few authors have done before: He affected my life... He actually changed a view that I have. I took something away from Lord of the Flies... I learned something. Even though Lord of the Flies can be read as entertainment, it is also a book that one can take something away from. You can share Golding's insight. That is the mark of a good book. Goldings 208 pages have done what Hobbes' entire corpus has failed to do: change my stance.	2000-11-27

US	52173832	R3GK0PCY42TMCO	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	3	1	7	N	N	profoundly wrong	In the notes to the copy of the book that I read, Golding said that &quot;The theme of the book is an attempt to trace the defects of Society back to the defects of human nature.  The moral is that the shape of a society must depend on the ethical nature of the individual and not on any political system however apparently logical or respectable.&quot;<br />This seems to me to be profoundly wrong.  Ethics and morality are a function of the political system that society's adopt, not vice versa. Golding would have done well to read Hobbes' Leviathan.  Hobbes makes the much more convincing case that for man in the state of Nature, life was &quot;Nasty, brutish and short&quot;.  So man traded off a certain amount of autonomy to a central authority in exchange for protection from other men. Morality then flows from the political structures that men adopt.<br />Take an example on a smaller scale: the morality of informing.  In criminal enterprises the informer (rat, squealer, snitch) is immoral because the enterprise depends on secrecy--i.e., the Mafia , Revolutionary/Terrorist groups, crooked cops,  the Clinton White House--and anyone who parts the veil of secrecy is demonized, because informing endangers the entire structure.  In the normal run of life we are fairly conflicted about informing, we don't honor the informer (Sammy &quot;The Bull&quot; Gravano, Whittaker Chambers, Frank Serpico, Linda Tripp) but we do seek to protect them from retalliation by their bosses via whistleblower laws.  While  in totalitarian societies informing against those who oppose the state (even if it's your parents) is a heroic act.  Golding would have us believe that these differences are the result of the innate ethical natures of the members of the societies.  In fact, it is the agreed upon structure of the societies that determines what behavior is accepted as ethical.<br />GRADE: C	2000-10-31

Many people have read LOTF, often in school, due to its profound but simple style, themes and symbolism (making it ideal to generate essay ideas etc).  If you read it then, try it again now that you are all grown up and can view it with an adult mind.<br />If you haven't read it at all, well every thinking homo sapien should read it at least once.<br />If you are interested in the relevant socio-psychological interpretations that abound about it, look at a couple of the other reviews here.  I'm not going to go into a deep interpretative analysis of the various themes etc as everyone else is doing a good job of them.<br />All right, one thing they do seem to have missed is that the title is taken from a pigs head on stick, swarming with flies, which is used as a representation of evil and engages in an hallucinatory dialogue with the Simon character (who is a kind of religious entity, almost christ-like).  Note that the jewish word &quot;Beelzebub&quot; translates into english as &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;.<br />The symbolism is generally much more accessible than that.

This classic tale has stood the test of time not only because it is beautifully written, but because it takes a revealing look at basic human nature, both good and bad. Golding uses the circumstance of teenage boys marooned on a tropical island by a plane crash to illustrate in exciting detail how some react to conflict and adversity. The flawed &quot;society&quot; the boys develop in their quest for survival is a microcosm of our modern civilized world. Lessons and questions abound in his masterful prose--without preaching or pretense.<br />This book is much more than just a story; it is art. It's one those pieces of literature that add to culture and foment introspection in young readers.

I did find the book immensely to my disliking,  however. I couldn't help but to be annoyed as I read it. I do not care how  accurate the children's speech patterns may have been, it was obnoxious to  have to deal with. The term &quot;littluns&quot; got under my skin and  stayed there like a piece of debris trapped deep around one's eye. Also  difficult to bear was that the antagonists were too hateable, which really  knows how to irritate. The childish ways of the book were simply annoying.  Also annoying was the fact that any grown up reader and likely most child  readers had to deal with knowing there was no true &quot;beast&quot; from  the beginning.<br />This would probably be a decent book to have elementary  school students read, but my having had to read it in 10th grade was  ridiculous.

The novel THE LORD OF THE FLIES focuses on the defects of society and their relationship with the defects of human nature. The story begins when about fifteen prep shool boys are stranded on a Utopia-like paradise island  after their plane crashes. They immediately try to set up a social system  like any modern-world people would. Through democracy(a vote) they crown an  attractive, intelligent boy named Ralph as leader. They crown a wild,  power-hungry boy named Jack and a mellow, calm, an most importantly  peaceful boy named Simon as his assistant-leaders.  As the novel  progresses Jack, who is also the leader of the choir(the group of boys who  represent the military) becomes very violent, power-hungry and mutinous and  attempts several times to overthrow Ralph before finally leaving the group  of boys to form a tribe of his own. This split is what drives the book  forward into the amazingly complex and symbolic novel that it is.  It is  through this split that Golding tries to explain the main theme of his  novel. This theme being of course that the defects of society can be traced  back only to the defects of human nature and that shape of a society  depends upon the ethical nature of the creatures that inhabit it not  anything else no matter how perfect or logical it appears.  With this  theme set in place Golding then begins to use complex symbolism such as the  symbol of the sow, who represents the human conciense,and Piggy who's  glasses represent the sane, accurate view and who himself represents the  sane voice of society. It is through these characterizations that Goldings  novel becomes the writing of a genius.  If you are a psychologyst who  hasn't read this book-READ IT! If you're a person interested in the study  of society read this book!  Thanks,  Nick McCulloch,15	2000-07-28

This book was good in the sense that it focused on the faults of  society through the group of stranded boys on the island, which was very  creative.  But I however did not like the book for the sole reason of the  killings, and how the boys felt no remorse at all, except for Ralph.  This  is  exaclty what the author intended of course, but I thought it was very  morbid and cruel.  I would advise you not to read this book if you are  looking for something uplifting.	2000-07-18

Chaos, fear, blood-bath. Written after WWII, and loaded with symbolism and  comments about civilization and violence, the only criticism that really  bugged me on the book is that there are no girls or females on the island;  how can you realistically have a society, or critique mankind and exclude  the other half?	2000-07-18

They end up on an uninhabited desert island where they are faced with what  seems like a perfect situation to them - NO ADULTS!<br />At the beginning,  the situation is paradise to them, until they realize that they might be  there longer than they thought.  They have to learn how to  survive.<br />Ralph, the story's protagonist, decides that they should be  logical and set up shelters.  Ralph is a smart boy in that he is thinking  about the good of everyone.  Sometimes though, even Ralph does give in to  the primitive desires of man and joins the celebration after a successful  pig hunt.<br />Piggy, an overweight, nearsighted, asthmatic, serves as the  well meaning reminder of what they &quot;should&quot; be doing.  Ralph  befriends him, even when no one else will listen to him or take him  seriously. Piggy's glasses or &quot;specs&quot; prove to be very useful and  are a very meaningful symbol of society: the maintenence and breakdown  thereof, in the story.<br />Then there's Jack, the leader of a choir of boys  from his school.  His character eventually serves as an antagonist for  Ralph and a symbol of man's primal desires for survival.  He provides meat  for the group and uses it as a powerful luring agent to get some boys to  join his &quot;tribe&quot;.<br />Simon is another character you should be  familiar with.  My personal favorite as he turns out to be the wisest and  most spiritual (not necessarily &quot;religious&quot;) of the entire lot of  boys.  Simon, prone to fainting spells brought on by epilepsy, is never  taken seriously by any of the boys, including Ralph or Piggy.  His  spiritual nature leaves him far beyond the others' realm of  understanding.<br />There are two unfortunate, but dare I say - necessary,  deaths in the book but I won't give that part away.  I say  &quot;necessary&quot; but only on a symbolic level. Once you discover what  the characters meant symbolically to the story, you will know what I  mean.<br />The ending goes through two extremes.  It gets you right into the  action in a wonderfully descriptive chase scene which almost makes you feel  like the one who is being chased and then takes you right out forcing you  to become an objective observer of the scene.<br />Terrific writing, fantastic  symbolism and an overall great story.  Not for the faint of heart though.  I would recommend this one for grades 7 and up.a symbolic level.

Basically, this:  In the battle between your impulsive, selfish side and your rational, moral side which would ultimately win?<br />The plot of this novel is misleadingly simple.  Some shipwrecked British lads must fend for themselves on an island while  waiting to be rescued.  Their only hope for returning to civilization is to  keep a fire burning in the hope that a ship will see the smoke.  A leader  is chosen.  The society is well organized and, intitially, works.  Then the  &quot;littlun's&quot; confess their superstitious fear of a mysterious  &quot;beast&quot; lurking in the woods.  Disputes concerning priorities and  leadership divide the boys.  Gradually, the wilderness in them all  possesses them wholly.  This is the tragedy in Golding's eyes.  Everything  natural is condemned, while things of intellect are placed on a pedestal.<br />This book is nothing if not symbolic.  Jack is selfish desires (Freud's  &quot;Id&quot;)while Piggy is intellect (Freud's &quot;Superego&quot;).  Piggy's glasses represent reason.  Remmeber this when anything happens to  them, and what Piggy is like without them.  Ralph is Mr. Inbetween (AKA:  Freud's &quot;Ego&quot;).  He's the closest to you and me.  The conch  represents order in society.<br />Pay close attention to the physical  appearances of the characters as well.  It indicates how well adapted they  are to the island.  The trick is that those most suited to the island are  those most in tune with their instincts and animal desires.  THey are the  ones who give up on the fire.  THey are the ones whom commit the injust  acts.  THey are the inhumane consequences of total submission to human  desire.	2000-07-11

But at the same time their fate was intricatly layed in front of  me and compeling and made me stop and think, &quot;maybe it could happen  that way if...&quot; .

I was bored by the lack of theme to the story and much of the visual descritpion was unnessecary.  I was also confused by the absence of  important information.  Not until the end of the book did I realize that  the story took place during World War II.  Also, I could not decipher who  the boys were and why they were all together yet did not know each other  for some time.  Once I reached the reflective notes at the end, though, I  was very impressed by the symbolism and hidden ideas in the book.  I would  only prefer to find them myself in the reading, rather than be told them at  the end.  For instance, I made no connection as to how the sow was killed  to rape because the killing was not vividly described, and no resemblance  was obvious.  The notes told me that, and I understood the total point the  author was trying to make more, but I was still disappointed that I could  not have made the connections myself.	2000-06-15

Rather, it is an attack upon our own civilisation, and just how shallow this  is.<br />The storyline, as with most great literature, is very simple: A group  of boys are left to their own devices on a desert island following a plane  crash. Too begin with, the boys manage very well for themselves, keeping  themselves in order, making plans for rescue and providing for each other  and the community as a whole. Thimgs begin to go wrong, however, when  following a series of incidents the group splits down the middle and one  group shows itself to be decidedly more powerful and influential than the  other. Murders, riots and fires follow, showing the one group to have  returned to their roots of animal instincts to eat and to stay alive.  Golding successfully presents civilisatin as a farce that could fall apart  at the simplest hiccup in the grand scheme of things.<br />The book is a  chilling question of human nature, that raises very serious questions about  human life and nature.	2000-06-11

It is a fantastic story of a group of school boys stranded on an island. However, with close reading an allegorical underlying meaning surfaces. Golding masterfully creates a miniature society with the boys and  proceeds to depict it as corrupt and depraved, using Jack as a violent and  tyrannical politician-like figure.  When my english teacher first informed  my ninth grade class that we would be reading this potentially boring book,  I groaned along with my peers. However, within a few pages, I was  enthralled. I could not get enough of the lovable and heroic Ralph, the  endearing complaints of Piggy, the epilictic visions of the ill-fated  Simon, or the evil manipulations of the nefarious Jack and his hunting  hooligans.

Personally, by the time I've finished analyzing how  Piggy's glasses symbolize human reason, the pig's head represents human  evil, etc., the book has lost its impact for me and becomes  pretentious.<br />But that is not my main problem with this book. I find it  frightening that so many people consider this book 'revealing' and a  'classic'. This seems to indicate that the message of this book has  universal relevance for people. And this message is as follows: Humankind,  homo sapiens, people as we know them, are intrinsically evil. Meaning, that  deep down in our hearts we are nothing but wells of corrupt blackness, or  as Conrad so aptly put it, hearts 'of darkness'. Anything good we do is a  sham. We act a certain way only because civilization dictates it, but as  soon as the rules of civilization no longer get us what we want, or they  are no longer imposed on us, our natural tendency will be to fall into  evil, our true, innermost nature.<br />Garbage. I for one do not believe that  human beings are intrinsically evil. Are they intrinsically good, then? Of  course not. I am not advocating a world view based on naivete. Human beings  have a natural tendency for both good and for evil. How much these  tendencies influence a person's behavior is entirely up to him: he is not  wholly at the mercy of his baser instincts. Even in 'Heart of Darkness',  upon which Golding based this work, Marlowe faced the evil and did not  succumb to it. These boys are given no choice, as evil is the only true  reality. There is no way to fight it; one can either surrender to it, or  run from it by way of civilization. To take an active stand against it is  impossible.<br />Even in 'Les Miserables' during the horrendous poverty and  the barricades, where all of civilization is crumbling at its foundations  and people are rotting because of it, there are glimpses into the beauty of  humankind. Eponine, though sunk in squalor and darkness, finds redemption  by saving Marius; this in contrast to her father, whose evil increases all  the more. Jean Valjean sinks to the lowest level a human can sink to, yet  there is hope for him; and because one person had faith in the good that  was inside him, he, too found redemption. There is choice involved, and one  can either strive for light, or fall into darkness. Maybe people like  Golding because he unintentionally grants justification for the evil Man is  capable of--after all, we can't help it. It's our nature. Therefore people  need not bother to strive to become better than they are, to actualize the  beauty within themselves. Humans have no inner beauty; it is imposed from  outside to conceal the horror within.<br />But there is more.

But, with further reading and understanding of the book, I really came to love it. I wouldn't hesitate in calling it my all time favorite novel. On  the surface, Golding seems to be merely telling a tale of a group of boys  stranded on an island. However, a closer look reveals Golding's true  intentions of depicting the world and war as depraved and corrupt. He has  an extremely pessimistic view of human society and this can be seen through  some of the actions of the boys. I would also like to say that Ralph is a  great character and the movie is one that should not be missed!	2000-06-02

You just have to plow through the first few chapters to get to anything interesting, and there are times that you just dread the  fact that the dialogue is dying down and you're about to be  &quot;treated&quot; to one of Golding's run-on descriptive passages.  Nevertheless, it is worth it. When things pick up in the middle of the  book, it becomes easier to see how the flowery language is there to create  mood, and to show us, not what the island is like, but what it is like to a  group of lost, scared boys. Once you start to be able to follow the mood  Golding is trying to create, that's when this story about the pulling away  of the thin veneer of civilization that humans wrap themselves in and the  revelation of the savage with-in really unfolds for you. And that's when  you realize what makes this book so powerful and enduring.	2000-06-01

William Golding does a wonderful job of keeping this complex story at a reading level accessible to all respective age levels, although parents might want to think twice about letting more SENSITIVE children read the  book.  I say this because there are a number of scenes involving bloody  fights or deaths and less experienced readers might find them disturbing.  Overall, the book is great.  It's a story of a small group of children  marooned on a tropical island then forced to fend for themselves in its  wild environment.  As most of you probably know, a type of mutiny ensues,  and the small band of miserable castaways breaks into two groups, one  calling themselves &quot;the hunters&quot; led by a rugged and violent  young man named Jack who thinks the most pressing responsibility he has as  leader is to procure meat for his crew, and the smaller, nameless group led  by the book's youthful father figure Ralph, who believes keeping a lighted  signal fire atop a nearby mountain the most important island duty. The book  flows nicely and keeps the reader's attention.  It's a bit of a cautionary  tale much like Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; or Huxley's &quot;Brave New  World.&quot;  The morals of the story are easily learned and hard to  forget, but I'll let you figure them out on your own. If you're looking for  something engaging to read, you won't go wrong buying this.	2000-05-28

It is about a group of boys who land on a desserted island after their plane has crashed. No adults had survived the plane wreck, so the kids are without any adult supervision.  Throughout the book the children learn to survive on their own by hunting  pigs, and building shelters, with Ralph as their leader. But they cannot  all get along, and when Jack starts his own hunting tribe the group of boys  split. The boys in Jack's group always wanting to hunt, quickly turn into  fierce savages. So fierce that others are endangered of being killed. After  most of the boys join Jack's tribe, Ralph and only a few other boys are  left to try to get themselves and the others recued.This is an event filled  book with a lot of action always taking place.

I didn't, but picked it up anyway-- and it has quickly become one of my favorite books.  On the surface, it is a tense, exciting adventure novel, short enough to be read in a single day, but long enough  to provide fulfillment.<br /> Lord of the Flies can be read, on another level,  as a cautionary tale of the true state of human nature-- what Ursula K.  LeGuin would call a &quot;thought experiment.&quot;  Like LeGuin's Left  Hand of Darkness, it is one author's attempt to decipher one facet of human  nature by isolating it and stripping it of its support.  In this case, a  group of children are stranded on a tropical island during what appears to  be the Third World War.  With no adult authority, the children attempt to  fashion their own society based upon the one they left.  This quickly  breaks down, however, and the true nature of Man emerges.  As a thought  experiment, this book works wonderfully.  Isolated from  &quot;civilized&quot; society, they are freed from the bonds and  restrictions of it, and as children, are not as inculcated with the  lingering values and mores that adults would bring with them.  The stage is  set for a clear glimpse of true human nature, were it to be freed of the  bonds of society.  In Golding's view, human nature clearly reflects what  Thomas Hobbes called the &quot;state of nature&quot;: the children live in  a state of &quot;continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life  of people, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.&quot;<br /> The  symbolism in this book is clear and precise, without disrupting the realism  or flow of the book.  Piggy, with his glasses and insistence upon order,  represents society's rules and Freud's superego.  Ralph, the obsensible  leader of the children, tries to balance the wishes of the children to play  and the choir to hunt with the need to keep a signal fire going and build  shelter, and could easily represent Freud's ego.  Jack, the choirmaster,  with his anger and eagerness to hunt and gain power, describes the id at  its most merciless.  Many more symbols abound, but writing of them would  ruin what is a fantastic story!y represent Freud's ego.

The plot of the story is that a group of English boys become stranded on a deserted island from a plane crash.  The boys try to gather food, construct shelter, hunt, and make smoke signals for boats to  rescue them.  Ralph is the oldest of the boys, and he is elected chief of  the group of children.  Ralph tries to put responsibility in the gang of  boys, so they don't just eat, play, and swim all day.  Piggy is Ralph's  advisor.  He is a little chubby, and his \\"specs\\" come in handy to light  fires as signals to passing ships.  Jack is the leader of a group of face  painted hunters.  He becomes a large nuisance to Ralph's idea of order and  responsibility.  Jack lures many of the boys to hunt with him.  Through  this turn of events, there are no shelters being made and the signal fire  is not being tended to.  Everyone is just hunting pigs all day.  This fall  of Ralph's plan becomes a large problem, and Ralph realizes that instead of  being a hunter, he is the one being hunted.	2000-05-01

This book was written in an attempt to find out.  In Lord of the Flies, William Golding shows us, naked and exposed, at once  innocent and corrupt, noble and cruel, and all to human. He uses symbols,  theories, and ideas to help illustrate his point. For example, the female  sow, represents the mother of the boys - the killing of the sow symbolizes  the killing of the mother.  The roles of the three main characters are  different; Ralph being the ego (self knowledge), Piggy being the superego  (conflict between thoughts) and Jack being the id (want).  Lord of the  Flies uses symbolism so well, that it is understandable, interesting to  read, and catching. The writing in this book is structured so well. I was  able to understand what he wrote, and I was hooked.  What I liked best  about this book was the clarity of it, the style of his writng and the plot  of the story. His writing is also very specific. I was able to put pictures  in my mind about what was being said - {Over the Island the build up of  clouds continued. A steady current of heated air rose all day from the  mountain and was thrust to ten thousand feet; revolving masses of gas piled  up the static until the air was ready to explode}-this is an excerpt from  chapter nine. It is obvious that his style of writing is excellent and  should be highly acknowledged. It deserves a 5 star rating.  Lord of the  Flies is a wonderful, symbolic, adventure into ritual, primitivness, death,  guilt, innocence, betrayal, and war. Only then, will you find the answer to  the question, &quot;can we trace the defect of society back to the defect  of human nature&quot;?	2000-04-27

I  am now in upper level college classes, and found the re-reading of this  book much more valuable now that I understand more about the world around  me.

Baring in mind that it was written during the time of WW2 and the Nuremburg War  Trials it is not surprising that the book discusses the essential evilness  of man. It is a harrowing tale of a group of young boys stranded on an  island and the slow descention into a savage existence. What makes the book  so brilliant yet so disturbing is that it cronicles the feelings each and  everyone of us have felt at some stage of our lives. One is prompted to ask  the question, &quot; In a world dominated by humans, in a world in which we  have progressed so drastically what seperates us from animals?&quot; It is  bleak but true and the deep psycological symbolism of the characters and  the events make it something special and deserved of its reputation as one  of the key books of the 20th century. Like &quot;The Catcher in the  Rye&quot; and &quot; Heart of Darkness&quot; it make us think about  humanity and makes us question our existence.

But in reality, the true nature  in humans tear down that wall when it is given the chance and the inhuman  creature in us all comes out.

I think that  Golding's use of children as the main characters in the novel is helpful in  conveying this message.  The children's refusal to follow Ralph stems from  the nature of children, in that they found no excitement or satisfaction  from following him and his rules.  Ralph's maturity resembled that of  grown-ups, which children revolt against.  On the other hand, Jack's group  offered as an incentive more childish excitement in paiting themselves,  hunting and ceremonies.  We, as the reader, can see the children's folly in  following Jack, but they are unable to think rationally due to their  immature natures and new-found freedoms.  Using children, Golding tries to  symbolize the essential qualities in every human's soul and reveal  something to the reader about him or herself.	2000-04-06

If I did, I probably would rate this book at a lower score. Anyway, I always had known the basic plot, so I while back I picked it from  the library. I now know why many teachers make this book required reading.  Golding puts his view of human civilization with Freudian philosophy in  what first appears to be simple story of English boys on an uninhabited  island. In the beginning, that is how the novel seems, and it has a  cheerful mood. But Golding's main point is that civilization is fragile,  and without government people are asking for chaos. He brings Freudian  concepts into play, like id, ego, and superego(Jack, Ralph, Piggy). Adults  here are represented like government figures, but no adults on the island  mean no government. The boys do their best to work together at first, but  soon after there is manipulation and mutiny. Symbolism packs this book, not  only in inanimate objects, but the characters. Jack(agression),  Ralph(order), Piggy(reason), and Simon(consolation that was never  realized). All the while the island is presented as a paradise and a lonely  piece of wilderness at the same time. Golding puts his message across  clearly, and at the same time puts out a good adventure novel. I only had  two main problems with Lord of the Flies. One is that overall, the island  seemed to be very small and needed more decription of it's physical  features, and two, Golding should have put the boys' average age a few  years ahead. But those aside, this novel is a good one, being rightful to  earn classic status. If you like to read something that makes your brain  crank while being entertained, Lord of the Flies is a pretty damn good  deal.	2000-04-04

Golding's tale, set on a remote island, is a story of a group of  British boys' survival from a shipwreck.  The boys, aged from a mere six to  twelve, must struggle to go on with their everyday lives, apart from all  adults or authority.  This separation from society creates this overall  thematic conflict:  the struggle between the civil and primal natures of  man.  This conflict is enacted beautifully in this fictional setting.  There are an endless amount of symbolic insights that can be applied to  this struggle in the heart of man, ranging from as simple as the conflict  between good and evil, or order and disorder, to complex Biblical  allusions.  This symbolism proves to be essential to the effectiveness of  the book, because it allows the reader to apply these symbolic ideas to  himself.  The struggle of the nature of man's heart is a simple yet  interesting theme that contributes to the greatness of this novel. One of  the most remarkable aspects of the book is the way in which Golding can  bestow the characteristics of the differing natures of man's heart through  young boys.  The boys in his novel perfectly symbolize the complex  instincts and emotions of adults without violating the simplicity of  children.  They speak with a child's vocabulary, think with a child's mind,  and still can represent the complexity of mankind.  This is certainly a  commendable feat on part of the author. The pure adventure aspect of Lord  of the Flies is remarkable as well.  Golding conveys a thrilling adventure  story to create his symbolism through.  He expertly uses the tools of  literature, especially foreshadowing and description, to achieve a  beautifully scripted story of adventure and suspense.  This element of  having an eventful story line full of action is often absent in pieces with  such quality of symbolism.  It is difficult to achieve both of these  purposes and still end up with a good novel.  Lord of the Flies is an  extremely easy book to understand, even with its endless depths of interior  symbolism.  It's length is quite concise, making it able to read in just a  few sittings.  It is short, simple, and still a classic:  yet another  commendable mention to Golding.  Golding's ability to convey such a story  in such a simple manner is quite amazing to me.  The only possible foreseen  problem in reading the book is the long time it takes to set up the story  line.  But this problem is soon overcome, for the set-up proves to be  valuable to the suspense and foreshadowing aspects of the plot.  Lord  of the Flies is a beautifully written classic.  Its spell-binding story and  magnificent structure create a pleasing and worthwhile experience.  Golding's novel teaches the reader of the natures of his own heart, giving  this piece an educational standpoint.  This book, along with Conrad's Heart  of Darkness, has given me a deeper understanding of the desires and  tendencies of man.  This, I believe, is one of the main objectives of the  book:  to further question and achieve deeper understanding of ourselves  and those around us.  This message is an important one; trying to  understand some of the complexities of humans is a wonderful gift of  knowledge that proves itself useful in life.  This knowledge never stops  growing throughout our lives, and literary pieces such as this one help us  to remember this quest for self-knowledge, and the love we all have for it.It is difficult to achieve both of these  purposes and still end up with a good novel.

That is until this year when I was forced to read it again in order to teach it to my tenth-grade class.  I had forgotten what a great read it is.  As a teen, I missed out on so much that Golding had  intended.  Today--now that I'm a little older, a little better at  understanding novels--I see so much more.  The symbolism is wonderful, as  is the book as whole.  Plus: this is a beautiful edition and the E.M.  Forster intro is brilliant.  If you are looking for a heavy read, you might  want to try something else.  But, if you're looking for a great, quick  read, give &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; a whirl.	2000-03-14

I've read reviews that twitter on about the psychology of young males and so on, as if adults - and women, for that matter - would act any differently. I don't think so.  We see events like those that occur in Lord Of The Flies every day. In many  ways, it can be read as a study in power. We have Ralph, who does not seek  power - is perhaps not truly suited to it -  but has it thrust upon him.  Piggy, who has the intelligence to lead well, but not the public appeal.  And Jack, who wants power purely for power's sake. He sees it as his  birthright, and even though he recognises his own failings, will not except  anyone else as leader above himself. Ralph, it turns out, has the makings  of a good leader, but it is the Might of Jack that crushes the Right of  Piggy and Ralph, to the detriment of the entire community. Sounds much like  the day-to-day politics of almost every Western country, doesn't it? As I  said, some people see Lord of the Flies as an abstract study of the  psychology of young males in an extreme situation. I see it as an example  of everyday life in the history of mankind.	2000-02-23

I hated this book so much that I went up to my teacher and told her exactly what I thought of this abysmal  piece of work.  Guess who wasn't too happy.  I've heard so many great  things about this book, so I just couldn't wait to start it.  &quot;Yeah,  Lord of the Flies, great!&quot;  From the first page, I hated it.  This  book is so hard to follow.  I read  a page.  Then I think to myself  &quot;What the heck was that?&quot;  I read the page again and only got a  vague impression of what was going on and struggling to figure out what  William Golding was trying to get across to the reader.  Sure its possible  to figure it out, but how can you really enjoy a novel if  you have to  strain your brain to be able to get the badly told story into your mind and  keep it  there.  I disliked this book so much that I removed the cover  and glued it on upside down before I gave it back to my teacher.	2000-02-22

In magnificently eloquent prose and a deeply engrossing story to boot, Lord of the Flies has deservedly  been dubbed a modern classic. One can relate to the actions of the  characters simply because we were all once of that age and were all once  driven by the same urges, impulses, and emotions that Golding so  graphically and yet so effectively illustrates.

This book provides a powerful representation of our  own society, and how these animalistic natures all exist in the underlying  shadows.

I have not reread it in the twenty years since, but it has remained vividly in my memory.  I feel the greatest merit of the book  is its richness of potential interpretations.<br />A favourite of my own is an  anti-communitarian reading in which Golding demonstrates the peril in the  way Ralph conciliates Jack after his defeat in the leadership ballot: `The  Choir [the distinct cultural minority] is yours, of course, ... they can be  ... hunters'.  The result is that Simon, a choir member, is given to the  hunters as a sacrifice, when, had he been protected in the pursuit of his  individual ends, he would have served society better by being able to  announce his discovery of the nature of the beast, freeing the boys from  the terror that played its part in pushing them towards  barbarism.<br />Another ironic light can be seen in the passage in which Ralph  dogmatically insists on the importance of maintaining a fire, but cannot  remember why.  He has to be reminded by Piggy, that it is a signal for  rescue.  When considered against the nuclear war background, this is a  haunting reminder of the nuclear scientists who chose to work on the  Manhattan Project to secure a nuclear bomb as a deterrent against a nuclear  Third Reich, but became so absorbed in the means that they omitted to  reevaluate them periodically against the ends.	2000-01-31

I think that Golding's purpose for writing this book was to show how innocence is lost and how we, as humans, cannot live in without any rules or authority.  I certainly agree with his message because you reach a point  in life where in one way or another you loose your innocence.  I also agree  with the fact that it is impossible to live without any rules or authority.  The conch that Ralph used to gather everyone was a great literary element  because it showed authority but at the same time it was fragile and white  like Piggy.  Personatly, I do not think this book is believable because  it  is not possible for only young boys to survive a plane crash and to live  all by themselves on a deserted island. The part that I liked the least was  the way Simon and Piggy died.  I understand that Golding did it the way he  did it to, show how the boys changed from the beggining of the story to the  end of it.  But I still think it was very cruel. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO  PEOPLE ALL AGES BUT MOSTLY TEENS BECAUSE IT IS INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT  THE LOST OF INNOCENCE..... :)	2000-01-04

I read it in a day, and it consumed my thoughts.  The book starts out quite harmlessly, and I began by almost thinking I was in for a fun  adventure story.  However, I felt otherwise as I absorbed the dark, gaunt  style this book was written in.  There was something ancient and evil  behind the pages of this book, in the unwritten words, and unuttered  dialogue.  The line that seemed most significant to me were the words  spoken to Ralph by Jack after he has returned from pig hunting.  They are  discussing the feeling that both of them have had in the jungle, of being  followed, and &quot;as if it wasn't a good island.&quot;  The Beast is a  recurring theme throughout the story, and I don't believe it refers to any  one thing.  The Beast takes the form that the children want it to, and it  begins with their imaginations, but amounts to so much more.  The children  are the Beast, in a sense, in the aspect that their own selfishness,  jealousy, and savageness have awakened this monster.	2000-01-02

It was about a group of British schoolboys who were plane-wrecked on an  uninhabited island. Ralph,a &quot;bigun&quot;,tried to lead and create a  semblance of civilization,with the corpulent,wise Piggy as his assistant.  It didn't work for long. One boy,Jack,rebelled and gathered up his own band  of painted savages. There were horrible casualties(I won't say who).  &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is scarier than any horror novel I've ever  read, because the events in it are feasible. Government and rules merely  veil the evil in every person. We must try to further suppress this force  with love so the human race doesn't suffer the same fate as these British  boys. It may sound corny,but to love  takes more strength than painting  ourselves as savages. Back to the book itself. It was very deep and made me  lose some of my innocence. Reading it was a life-changing experience. I  read it avidly,eager to see what would happen next. The end made me breathe  a sigh of relief. I reccomend this book to mature,brave readers.	2000-01-01

Golding, in a vain effort to make people understand  his sideways point of view, wrote a parody of 1940's British society. Who  really gives a crud? I don't. All in all, please, please, please don't read  this horrible, awful, stupid, pointless, terrible book that is a great  waste of time.

It not only captures the minds of readers of every age, but it states a point about human nature. I think Golding's point in writting this book is  to tell show us that there is a &quot;beast&quot; in all of us. As young  Simon so clearly states. I agree with him on this point because at one  point and time we all can loose control and become &quot;savage&quot;.  Golding was brilliant for using children to bring this point across,  because so often we think of children as being the complete example of  innocence. And I think as the years progress or situations change, we  gradually loose our innocence. This book was great and I would recommend it  for children and adults of all ages.	1999-12-23

In this book I think that the author used  climax best, because it got extremely intense as it got closer to the end  of the book. I liked the intenseness in the book a lot. This book was  believable to me. It was believable because the events that took place,  really could have happened. The only thing that could not have taken place  was that an airplane was attacked, than crashed and no adults survived any  of it. I also think that the book was less than perfect.

He is telling about how mean, cruel, and uncaring people can be, no matter what age. I definately agree with this because of all the horrible things that are seen  on the news, it's supports my theory. I think the author used characters  best in the book because, in the book, from beginning to end, he analzyes  and builds up every character. This is good because it lets you know who  you're reading about. This book was pretty much believable, excpet for the  fact that the kids were a little too young to be doing what they were  doing. Which incidentely, in my opinion, is the only flaw in this book. If  i were the author, i would have simply changed the kids ages by making them  a couple of years older. If this was done, it would have been much better  and more realistic. I would recommend this book to anyone.	1999-12-20

He uses symbolism to describe the fact that there is evil in everyone. He also uses symbolism to describe fear and anger. He provokes the mind to think that they are in the story by using  descriptions. Although some aspects of this book were unbelievable, it  could happen. I personally see only two flaws in the book. The first being  that everything needs to be more innnocent in the beginning so that when  drastic changes come they are extremely drastic. The second being that the  book goes very slowly, almost too slowly. However, overall it was an  excellent book. I enjoyed reading Lord of the Flies.	1999-12-20

I agree  because he had so much symbolism and it made the most sense to me. This was  and wasn't believable. I would have made the story better by not being so  cruel to the boys with good intentions. I probably would have killed Jack  and Roger instead of Simon and Piggy.

Sure, sometimes it does become annoying and you lose your place a lot, or you can't understand  what's going on or who's doing what.  Yet, it was still good.  The book  was, though, within the greater whole, a well written believeable piece.  Some of what happened could happen and some of if really isn't that  believable.  Yet, with how well Golding described it as if he was actually  seeing it,  that helped get the effect of it being real.  Also, none of us  really know what would happen if we got stranded on an island. So we don't  know how true or untrue the whole actions of the situation are. Some people  might agree or not with what all I have said, because everyone interprets  things differently, but this is what I think	1999-12-20

I agree with the author because the boys were so innocent in the beginning but as time goes bye that soon changes. The author best handled symbolism. For example, the  conch represented authority and Piggy's glasses represented  nearsightedness. These symbols helped me understand the book. The book  wasn't believable because I don't think that a bunch of boys ranging from  the ages of 5 and 13 can really survive on an island all by themselves. I  think the author shouldn't have Piggy and Simon die in such a cruel way. If  I had a choice I would've let them live and I would've had Ralph and Jack  become friends again.Overall, I thought the book was good.	1999-12-20

I agree with this message because children left unattended have no one to prevent them from doing wrong, no authority. I like the characters  and the plot that the author created. It really helps display the author's  message of life without rules: everyone would run wild. The book was  believable because the children really acted like children would act with  out any adults. Although the novel had an excellent begining and middle,  the ending was in one word, stupid. I didn't understand it either. The end  seemed like he didn't spend much time on writing it and rushed.

I think  the authors purpose for writing the book was to show how people can turn  savage in a short period of time without anyone to enforce the rules.I do  agree with his message, because society's do need rules or else things like  what happened in the book, will happen every day. In the book I think that  the author handled the characters very well.There were many characters,and  he described them and their personality very well.I think Golding is a  great author. This book is very believable to me, because a plane could  crash on a deserted island, and kids could have to take care of themselves  with no grownups around.It all is possible. I think that  Golding did a  great job with this book and it is fine how it is written.	1999-12-20

I think he did the characters very  descriptively. He is psychoanalyzing every main character in the entire  book. It was very believable. I could imagine a news report saying about a  couple of boys found on a burning island. About changing the book, I think  it should stay the way it is.

To show that authority is trully needed in the world . I agree one  hundred percent with this message because there is a need for consequences  for people who refuse to listen to authority.  The literary element that Golding handled the best was  symbolism. For example, the conch was a symbol of authority and power. When  the conch was broken , there was no authority , but complete chaos.  This book is believeable because it is possible to get stranded on an  island and it is possible for people to become mean and spiteful.  The  only bad thing about the book was some of the words were hard to  understand. If I had written the book.

Golding's message was that there is evil inside of us all. Golding is correct in this manner but I thing  that everyone has good in them, too. In Golding's Lord of the Flies he  handled the characters the best. The characters were all well developed and  each one represented a different aspect of human nature: Ralph was  leadership, Piggy was intelligence , Simon was spirituality , Jack was  dictatorship , Roger was evil and Samneric represented the fact that  everyone needs someone to help them function. Lord of the Flies was a  little unbelievable in the plot aspect of the book. Twelve year olds  wouldn't believe in democracy. Also the whole island seemed kind of unreal  and fake like it was just a backdrop. I think the plot was less than  perfect and could have been developed a little more. All in all, I would  give this book 3 stars.	1999-12-20

Yes, it does have its points about life, but all in all it isn't realistic. I think the author's(William Golding) purpose for writing this book was to  state the theme that &quot;there is a need for civilization and  rules.&quot; I do agree with him. The book's high points are the events  that happen when there is no civilization or rules. Murder, theft, and  violence are all products of no civilization, and that is shown in the  book. The best literary element in this book is the characters. Golding  described his characters to the max. You knew what a character was thinking  when he said something or did something. The good characters were so  innocent and pure. While, on the hand, the evil characters were some of the  worst people I've ever read about. The reader also loved to hate the evil  ones, they do things that get on your last nerve.  I don't think this book  is believable. In the book, the children have to deal with events and  situations that a thirty year old man would have trouble trying to solve.  Children of the age of twelve or younger break into groups because of who  stole the toy or the video game, not about how they should live or whether  or not a childs schedule fits their lifestyle. Bottom line is that the book  was good but has it's flaws.	1999-12-20

I agree with him because some of the boys died due to lack of rules and discipline.  They needed civilization on the island.  Also, I think that  Golding handled the art of symbolizism best.  The spactacles, the conch,  and all of the other symbols made the novel a little bit entertaining.  I  think that the novel, Lord of the Flies, was believable because without  rules and authority figures young teenagers will act in that manner,  uncivilizied.  There is nothing to my knowledge that Golding could have  changed.  I did not like it when Piggy died because he was my favorite  character.

A group of boys crash onto a deserted island without the supervision of adults.  They quickly begin to form their own governments.  One of the boys, Jack, represents a tyrannical dictator, who rules by the emotional  responses he gets from the other boys.  He also rules by charisma and fear.  Instead of devoting his energy to attempts of rescue, Jack prefers hunting  and killing the wild pigs that also live on the island.  Ralph, on the  other hand, represents a less effective, yet good-hearted democratic  leader.  Slowly, his group of boys is swayed away from him by Jack's  fun-loving wild clan.  The climax of the book begins when Jack feels Ralph  is a true threat to him, and orders his boys to hunt, and kill him.  Finally, just before he would have been captured, Ralph is rescued by a  group of sailors who were attracted to the island by a fire Jack had set to  smoke Ralph out of hiding, and he is saved.  This book really is  interesting if you delve into the proposed psychological implications about  our political society that Golding is making.  If you just want to read it  as an exciting novel it is good too, though.	1999-12-16

The story begins when a group of British school boys crash on a tropical  island. The only adult on the Island, the pilot, is dead. At the beginning  of the book, a boy named Ralph finds a conch and blows it. Immediately the  boys group into an assembly and choose Ralph as their leader. During the  first part of the book, the boys strive for order and organization, but  this soon starts to diminish. Ralph and his friends, Piggy and Simon, try  to accomplish the task of building shelter on the island. They are alone  doing this, for many of the boys are too young to help. Jack and his group  go off hunting small pigs which populate the island. The disagreement about  hunting causes great tension between Ralph and Jack during the book. As the  book progresses, Jack's group forget their civilized ways, and there soon  becomes a lack of order. Ralph and Piggy started a fire and it should be  kept going at all times on a mountain on the island, so that they have a  better chance of being rescued. They are unable to accomplish this task  because many of the boys do not care about keeping the fire going and would  rather go and play. Piggy's glasses are used for lighting fire and become  an important symbol of power later in the book. Jack and his group, now  known as &quot;the hunters&quot; become  obsessed with hunting and killing  pigs. To them, it is the most important task on the island. All the young  children are preoccupied with the Beast, which they believe in as some kind  of animal living on the island. During an assembly, Jack tries brings up  the fact that Ralph isn't a good chief, because he can't hunt. Piggy and  others are against the idea, but Jack is starting to become more and more  savage and overpowering. Jack, Ralph and Simon attempt to kill the beast,  in hopes of curing the little boys' worries. There is a violent storm on  the island, in which Simon wanders down into a group of boys who are  chanting and pretending to hunt. In all of the confusion and chaos, Simon  is &quot;accidentally&quot; killed. In this part of the book, Jack decides  that he is fed up with Ralph's leadership, and decides to start his own  tribe. He invites any boys who wish to join him to come along. Jack's tribe  becomes increasingly aggressive, and makes raid on the remaining boys'  camp. By this time Sam, Eric, Ralph and Piggy are the only ones not in  Jack's tribe. Sam and Eric are kidnapped by Jack's tribe, and Piggy is  killed by Roger. Ralph hides in the forest nearby and Jack attempts to hunt  him down. During the chaos the fire is neglected and eventually sets the  whole island on fire. A naval cruiser sees the smoke from the raging  island, and comes to the boys' rescue. Once the naval cruiser comes, and a  officers comes out, the boys are ashamed of how they have become. I really  enjoyed reading The Lord of the Flies and I would highly recommend it as a  must read for anyone at any age. The story unfolds at a very good pace  because it keeps the reader craving to know what will happen next. I feel  that this story had a very strong introduction and conclusion, making it  enjoyable to read. It almost felt like watching a thriller, when in reality  they were just pages turning.

US	50652961	R9FQXY94MU3J1	0399501487	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Books	5	0	0	N	N	great book	After I read Lord of the Flies I learned the importance of humans in this planet.  Lord of the flies is a book that reflects the behavior of humans when trying to adapt into a primordial environment.  The main characters in  this book are Jack and Ralph, and a group  of schoolboys that get stranded  on a deserted island after their plane crashes.  Ralph takes over and gives  rules to the other boys, trying to keep order, sort of like a society  created from scratch. Jack, on the other hand, becomes almost caveman-like,  trying to impose his own Darwinian rule over the other boys. It seems as  though his only rule is that there are no rules, and everyone that wants to  survive must learn to fight for everything that they have. I think that one  of the biggest fears that humans have in our consumer society today is not  really death, but being left to fend for themselves with no televisions, or  jobs, or cars, or restaurants. I think that the movie \\"the Blair witch  project\\" tries to deliver the same sort of general madness that people  experience when they are left out on the fringes of \\"normal\\" society.  People go insane when they find themselves in a situation where there is  nothing to do but try to survive, pretty much like an animal. It's sort of  like a reversion back to our original instincts which couldn't have been  all that different from animals: eat, sleep, and procreate. I think that  Goldwing developed a good and interesting story showing different aspects  of our own personalities exemplified by different characters. Jack is one  aspect, of course the side of us that wants calmness and order. Ralph is  the opposite side of the coin, while Piggy just wants simple pleasures,  without concern for order or for savage instincts. In conclusion I  recommend this book to people that are interested on drama and moral  complexity.  It is not a book for the faint hearted or people looking for a  straight forward story of good and bad.	1999-12-09

A group of English  schoolboys trapped on an island slowly turn into a horde of savages. Part  of the reason I read this book was in case it did become set reading for  our English class. It turned out to be an unnecessary exercise but I  enjoyed the book anyway. I actually envied the kids who had to read it the  following year for English. Listening to them complain that it's boring or  that they didn't understand it. (My class read &quot;1984&quot;, another  book I can recommend.)

To read this book and completly usnderstand this novel you  should and almost have to be a very intellectual person and you have to be  a deep person.  There is some symbolism that is very difficult to  understand and without a teacher or someone who understands the book  telling you what it is about it could be very confusing.  The book,  however, had very good discription and was very well written.  It made you  feel like you were actually there with them and feeling their struggles and  difficulties.  I felt their frustration with each other.  Can you imagine  if you were stranded on this island and you had no adults, no parents, and  no sense of government?  I felt as if the book was never ending and it  dragged on way too long.  I didn't enjoy reading it therefore I really  didn't put a lot of energy trying to figure out what the author was trying  to say.  I also am not a girl for ficton books and I usually don't like  books that we have to read in school.  If I were to read this book I would  deffenitly go in with a different mind set.  I would go in with the mind  set that this book is very difficult to read and that I have to foucs a lot  to see the hidden symbolism, and theme within the book.  I enjoyed the  scenery that was set up and the discription used to describe events.  I  recommend this book to anyone who has great understanding finding hidden  symbolism and picking out the theme.  Be prepared for a some what difficult  novel yet thrilling.  Be intense while reading this book!	1999-12-06

It takes a few pages to get yourself acclimated to Golding's writing style, which mixes stream-of-consciousness elements with traditional  narrative in order to better portray the young, impressionistic (and  impressionable) psyches of the children. That being said, the book hardly  qualifies as boring.  The statement it makes for the inner savagery and  essential evil of man is quite strong, and never before this book had any  other novel or work explored the subject in quite so provocative a manner.  Yes, there is violence, murder, all committed by young men.  They have  reverted to their &quot;natural state,&quot; shucked off civilization and  become what Golding argues to be the essence of man: selfish, violent, and  covetous. For any who dislike the disturbing imagery - that does not negate  the importance of the book.  If anything, that should only prove how  effective it is.  It disgusts you because it makes you wonder if you are  capable of it yourself. Four stars - a classic, but not a masterpiece.	1999-12-02

The fact is that, at the time, I thought the book lagged  at times, which is deadly to a casual young reader, as I was.  When I think  about what I remember of the book now, its kind of mysogynistic.  I  recommend it, marginally, though I plan to buy a new copy (my old one went  the way of Piggy) and give it another go as an adult.  I would suggest  &quot;Animal Farm&quot; over this, if the symbolic or allegorical content  is what you are looking for.

It isn't conforting in any sense of the word, but it gives a powerful message regarding the nature of humans.  The whole conflict  between Jack and Ralph is petty, but that was the point.  Written during  the horrors of WWII,  W. Golding wanted to show the readers that the only  difference between human beings and beasts is that we are governed by laws  and civilization, without which we do become savages.  Disturbing,  extremely, but that doesn't mean it isn't a good book.  Someone once told  me the purpose of art and literature is to make an audience think through  its powerful messages, not to be comfortable to place in a  &quot;hospital&quot; setting.  Lord of the Flies does exactly that.  Through vivid descriptions and masterful symbolism, this book conveys a  powerful message regarding human nature.

It is my understanding that this book is widely read in middle and high schools across this country by who I can only assume are impressionable children.  My critique of this book is also a bit of advice I offer to the  teachers of our youth.  Don't go half-way with this book.  Golding has done  an astouding job depicting the seed of evil that has been planted in every  human being since the Garden of Eden slip up.  Tell the children who the  Lord of the Flies is.  But, be careful...  This is a very serious book that  could have a positive or negative impact on a child.  I'm sure that the  movie KIDS (written by Harmony Korine) would never be shown in a high  school classroom, but really, this book and that movie drive at the same  ideas.  I'm only asking teachers and administrators to keep this in mind  when they decide to make Golding a part of their curriculum, because it  would be a perversion of classic literature to water down Golding's dark  portrayal of human nature....	1999-10-06

They teach us that it is a melodrama with Ralph  as the hero and Jack the villain.  Pursued by Jack and his tribe, who are  going to kill him, Ralph (and in fact all the surviving boys), are rescued  at the last minute on a beach by a naval officer, attracted by the  conflagration to which a large part of the island had been reduced.  In the  last phrase, we see &quot;the trim cruiser in the distance:&quot; a  warship. I.e., there is no real rescue.  They will only be transferred from  microcosm to macrocosm. They will live awhile longer, but are destined to  see destruction on a larger scale, for that is man's destiny.<br />The novel  describes the failure of a society; but there is something troubling in the  conclusion that such is an inevitable fate, a natural trend, the playing  out of man's truest self.  One must ask, if this is man, how can we  possibly &quot;weep&quot; with Ralph, &quot;for the end of innocence, the  darkness of man's heart?&quot;  We can have no sense of how bad this is  unless we have also a sense of something better.  Can we fall without  having first risen?  From whence comes the standard against which we can  call this denouement chaotic, evil, or in any way disagreeable?<br />The  customary interpretation suggests as Golding's message that, well, we just  have to try to be civilized and keep our fingers crossed, maybe it'll work  long enough for us to die a natural death.  And when we're bullied, try to  find the officer to protect us.  Apres-moi, la deluge.  Can this  multi-layered and complex novel really have been crafted in the service of  such a platitude? I liked the book then, and I like it now; but this sense  of its begging the question nagged away-- from the first, I like to think--  behind the appreciation.<br />Only years later would I stumble upon an article  proposing an alternate interpretation.  I regret that I did not photocopy  it on the spot, for subsequent efforts to locate it have failed;  evidently  it has disappeared from the library. I read it at first with some  distaste-- how dare this author say anything against the beautiful Ralph  whom I had come to revere-- but in the end, I found it satisfying; and  furthermore, it suggested something more insightful and practical than a  bromide.<br />In a nutshell: Ralph is not good, but Apollonian (fair-haired,  first seen against the sun). Jack is not evil, but Dionysian (red-haired,  dark-clad, the supreme singer).  And &quot;it takes all kinds.&quot;  The  trouble begins when Ralph belittles and scolds Jack when he hunts for meat.  Jack's apologia is simply, &quot;we needed meat&quot;: and that was a  fact, as shown by the boys' hitherto fruitarian diet causing diahrrea.  It  was Ralph's responsibility, as the elected leader, to acknowledge,  validate, and enlist even impulses and viewpoints which he might not  understand or share-- but he could not see beyond his own.  He alienated  and denied a part of the community-- perhaps a part of human nature-- and  things went downhill from there.<br />This article was illustrated and  supported by an abundance of details from the novel itself.  Not all will  be convinced by it, of course.  But that a learned critic could find a  meaning in the book which is so at variance from the conventional wisdom,  and support it so well with details from the book itself, says something  about the stature of the novel and its author.  Less-than-great books do  not sustain such ambiguity.<br />It remains, of course, a minority-- perhaps a  renegade-- thesis.  But there is no doubt, as has been remarked by other  critics, that Golding was dealing with ancient Greek as well as with  Christian symbols and ideas.  I speak as a Christian when I suggest that  the neglect of the former is due to a caricature of the latter among manyreaders.y  readers.	1999-07-10

It starts out fine and dandy, but then some of the boys (such as Jack an co.) start to lose it. In the end, two boys die, very horibbly. This is a  gruesome book, as the &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is a pig's head on a  stick. Simon had a very creepy &quot;interview&quot; with the pig's head.  The smaller boys (or &quot;littluns&quot; as the big boys say it) keep  talking about &quot;the beast&quot;, a gruesome ententity that lurks  wherever the boys are not looking. This turns out to be in fact a dead man  that floated down with a prachute, hence the name &quot;Beast from  air&quot;. I recommend this book for people of horror.	1999-06-16

Most of the characters in this book remind me of the shooters at Littleton, CO. This book would probably disturb someone who had experienced violence at  the hands of thier peers.

The complaints either suggest the book is too confusing and/or complicated -- far from the case; the narrative is very straightforward -- or that the book is implausible.<br /><br />But it's not.<br /><br />Rather than being implausible, what Lord of the Flies is, is disturbingly close to the mark when it comes to its look at our potential for evil and how quickly our tendency to exploit others rises to the fore when civilization is left behind.<br /><br />Still, who could blame them? They are struggling to understand themselves, and we expect them to absorb and understand what amounts to a rather dire essay on human nature? This is a harrowing tale about a group of lost youths, stranded and without guidance, whose fear and misunderstanding of the world (and each other) drive them to madness, and ultimately, murder ... far from a comfortable subject matter for young people still coming to understand their place in the world.<br /><br />Highly recommended as a short, cynical look into the human mind, and of the dangers that lie within us all.	1999-06-11

Golding was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in  Literature. I found it surprising to learn that a number of reference books  lists &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; as a science fiction novel! I later  discovered that the first draft of the book had the boys fleeing from a  nuclear holocaust at the start of the novel. Even in this final version  there is a brief discussion of the &quot;bomb&quot; and about fighting  &quot;Reds.&quot; In the novel, after a plane crashes on a deserted island,  the surviving boys of a boys school try to set up a democratic society,  waiting for rescue. At first, the boys cooperate and Ralph, with his friend  \\"Piggy,\\" tries to maintain order. But, it fails and the boys  &quot;evolve&quot; (or, devolve) back into savagery. It is only with the  arrival of a shocked rescue officer does a semblance of civilization  returns. The boys in the novel have the same names as the schoolboy heroes  in R. M. Ballantyne's &quot;The Coral Island,&quot; published in 1858. But,  Ballantyne's novel is &quot;naive optimism.&quot; Golding suggests that the  evil is in each of us and that, left on our own, man will always have a  tendency to revert to savagery. Is this really what underlies man's true  nature? There is goodness and discipline in us and that is represented by  Ralph. We just need more Ralphs.-----\\"Fancy thinking the Beast was  something you could hunt and kill!\\" said the head. For a moment or two the  forest and all the other dimly appreciated places echoes with the parody of  laughter. \\"You knew, didn't you? I'm part of you? Close, close, close!

I think it explains how society was made, it starts with people, they make rules and form an economy, there are leaders  and followers, the ones that think and ones that work, then something  happens and society falls apart.  It is intersting to see how a group of  boys can go from being so orderly to turning so savage.  This has a lot of  suspense in it, lots of detail, and a feeing of 'this could happen'.

Over all I feel Lord of the Flies is one of the most terrifying and intriguing books i have ever read.  After devastating plane crash, Ralph tries to bring order and work habits into effect.  All he can get from the  other boys is fun and games. Although they seemed fun, they soon destroyed  the group and caused havoc.  Golding set a perfect scene for this type of  book, a deserted island with only the jungle as sources of food and  shelter.  This would be a hard task to manage if your an adult, but he had  the oldest boy being around twelve.  The boys are forced into separation  from the beginning.  Even though they stay together in shelters and work,  they are separated by their beliefs and are bound to act out on it.  Ralph, with Piggy's help, try to keep the group of boys together.  No  matter what they say, Jack always seems to have something better to say or  do.

Hauntingly, Golding's prediction for 20th century adolescents,  left to their own unsupervised (and uncivilized) self-determination  applies to society at large as well as the individual. As Golding addresses  the passionate struggles that are played out on the island and  within the  minds of the main characters, he challenges his audience to reflect on  their own human nature as they try to identify with any of the  characters--none of whom are overly endearing.<br />Would I honestly be strong  enough to stand alone against a group of peers, or would I too get caught  up in the excitement of the anarchy and surrender to the thrill of the  hunt.

This story is about a bunch of kids who get marooned on an island. There is only a few smart people, of course, and the rest savages. The book shows what will happen to a bunch of kids who have to strive for themselves. They  thus form a government and it of course crashes. The kids are much too  selfish to put up a fire signal to get help, thus they hunt and try to act  like men in a true tribe. Yet all along, the lord who never actually  apears, only once in an illusion, watches them: observes them, and acts as  their silent wathcer, like their Lord. I give this book five stars becuase  it pretty much shows how kids try to live on their own and what sinisterism  they can obtain by living without authoirty.	1999-03-22

The average day reader would read this book and see the action and the drama.  They would see the fights  emerging between Jack and Ralph and they would have fun reading about the  pig hunts.  Then when they where done they would put it down and go on with  their life.  They would not however see the more intricate ideas of this  book such as theme and symbolism.  That is why this is such a good book, it  draws in people from all diffrent walks of life.  I am just a Sophmore  reader from North Gwinnett High School.  When I read this book for the  first time I just saw the plain old black and white script but then when I  started to research it more I saw so much more then that.  I understood  what Mr. Golding was trying to say.  So whether you want to read this book  or research it I gurantee that you will like it.

This book was not exactly what I would call an adventure but it brought some interesting things to thought. Basically what you have at the beginning is I'd say around maybe 50 kids (no adults) even though  only a few of them actually have a part and by the end you've got savages  running around killing each other! This book really shows you how screwed  up man kind really is- and these were only children. It shows you  everything that is wrong with society today by bringing up all the defects  in human nature.Many people think it's just our society that has messed the  world up but in reality, no matter what we do human nature is going to  spoil it in the end. When you read this book you'll become frightened when  you finish and piece all of it together and realize exactly what it is  showing you. But hey- read it for yourself and find out.

First of all, I'd like to tell people not to avoid this book because it is said to be depressing, disturbing and gory! I am extremely opposed to violence, but, unfortunately, violence is part of our way of life. People,  I think, shouldn't reject a book because it is disturbing, especially if it  relates the truth! If Golding had written about &quot;lots of happy little  bunnies jumping under rainbows and making friends and living in  harmony&quot; would this book be as popular as it now is? A good book  should have emotional power: it doesn't matter whether it makes you feel  happy or sad. Most famous books are tragic anyway! Turning away from Lord  of the Flies, is, unfortunately, turning away from the truth. Anyway, this  book was excellent and it, in my opinion, was an excellent parody of  Swallows and Amazons, Treasure Island and Coral Island. I've read all  three, and if you compare any of them with Lord of the Flies, you will see  how Golding was tragically mocking (for lack of a better word - I'm only in  eighth great and my vocabulary isn't that big!) the scenes of happiness and  adventure and social harmony that you find in these books. It is  interesting to not that two of the main characters in Coral Island (a  horrible book, by the way) are called Jack and Ralph (best of friends in  Ballantine's world!), which is crudely compared to Jack and Ralph in Lord  of the Flies, where Jack's ungrounded animosity towards Ralph leads him to  the point of murder! In conclusion, this excellent and disturbing (they can  be synonymous!) novel was an accurate and revealing portrayal of the evil  side of human nature, which civilization suppresses. PS I know I used he  word excellent a lot - I wrote this very quickly.	1999-01-17

Takes place on a deserted island, a group of  boys struggle to survive the harsh nature of the island and moreover,their own avarice.

For the first half of the story, I found myself interested in the story of young boys on an island trying to survive on their own.  As the group gathers on the otherwise deserted island, they begin to form a basic society.  Leaders quickly arise, and responsibilities are divided.  However, things begin to degenerate as duties become neglected, a power struggle arises, and some of the society decide not to follow the rules.  The book's symbolism soon becomes apparent, and the story of boys on an island becomes a commentary into society in general.<br />Golding does a superior job of using symbolism effectively.  The symbols are subtle and yet unmistakeable.  I found myself staying up late one night finishing the last few pages, and I've found myself yearning to read it over and over.	1998-10-17

Most of the boys which have come from big cities are not  used to killing their own food let alone fighting for their lives on a  secluded island without any contact with the &quot;outside world.&quot;  After reading this novel Ralph, Piggy, Jack and the rest of the boys are  not only characters in a book, but figures which become part of you life.

The major misconception about this book is that it's about a bunch of  little boys trapped on a tropical island.  The book is one big sybolism.  Why can't everyone see that?  And talk about dualities!  Piggy's glasses  are his window to the civilized world, and YET they start the fire that is  the cause of most savage conflicts!  Golding's a genius.  To those who say  that the boys degenerated too quickly, would you rather read an 800 page  book tracing their degeneration.  And chaos comes more quickly to 9 and 10  year olds than older people.  Most of the people in my H English 9 class  who didn't enjoy it focused on the  'boys on an island' story, and failed  to catch on when the army man said it was a game.  Maybe the book is a bit  bloody, but come on!  These are savages, only skeletons of the civilized  boys they once were.  This book is spectacular!

This was not the case.<br />The book centres around a group of English school boys who become stranded on a desert island. Even though it first seems that the story will follow the typical 'Coral Island' format, where all the children will have a fun time and become great friends, the novel actually develops into the opposite end of the spectrum.<br />Being away from civilisation and morals enables the boys to gradually enter a primative way of life, which develops until nearly all of the children unite to become a savage tribe, and lose all form of individual identity. They turn to an animal like way of life, which leads to tragic and harrowing events.<br />What I particularly appreciated about this novel was the way that Golding used the example of the school boys to explain the darkness in man's heart, and human evil. His ability to decribe events and emoti! ons makes the realisation that the savages are just little boys, even more horrible.<br />Although this book can take time to understand (due to all the religious symbolism), I would highly recommend it to anyone from the age of fifteen upwards. Although this novel is not something to read if you want cheering up, it is interesting, insightful, and gives controversial ideas to the reader about religion and human behaviour.	1998-07-24

The problem lies with the deeper meanings revealed in the book.  There are just to many of them..therefore it is really easy to get things confused.  The way the author describes the characters is lacking information.  For example, why is the boy Jack who only wants to hunt...so jealous of Ralph who only wants to get home, there must be more him that would justify his actions.  The description of the &quot;BEAST&quot; is very hard to understand...was there one or not? Some parts of the plot, (it was so hard to see where everything was going) were long and irrelevant to the story, such as the long, dragged out descriptions of the island itself.  The ending is the worst part about it...it ended so abruptly one minute there is a man hunt and suddenly there are the rescuers.  If you want to think alot about a book ...then this is the one for you. As for those who must read it for school...I suggest getting it from the library than actually buying a copy at the bookstore. I am sorry I purchased the thing myself...I guess that's what I get for listening to a friend telling me to read it.	1998-04-17

The book is burned into my memory. That's how good it was. It's a tale of a boy growing up, and the evil in our society. We see how the boys decivilize during their stay on the island, and degenerate into savage groups. As in Jack London's &quot;The Call of the Wild,&quot; the characters revert to their natural instincts. In this case, the boys become savage group hunters, similar to eary humans thousands of years ago. This book is hard to understand; cryptic, but will give you a new view of the world.	1998-01-30

Sure, it can be gory, somewhat odd, and even frightening, but the story is wonderful. If you think it's unrealistic, you either forgot what it was like to be a boy growing up or you are female. Young boys can be imaginative and insiteful, and they can be mean, cruel, and even a little sadistic. This book brims with themes and implications, almost EVERY LINE of the book displaying some theme or other. Here is a story of survival , of loyalty, of standing for what's right, of good vs. evil, and of the realities of a modern life. Yes, that's right. Not only does the boys' reversion to savagery hold implications of a world without law or order, but we also see that such a world is beyond so many of us. When they are rescued ---- boys once more, in just a mere glance.	1998-01-20

For those of you who do not know what an allegorical novel is, it is a story with two meanings- to entertain and to teach or suggest ideas about human nature or society.  Yes, Lord of the Flies is about naked boys running around and becoming savage, but it is also about fear and evil and how these two things emerge in our society.  So, before you start to read it and call it &quot;retarded&quot;, realize that golding was trying to get across a much deeper, philisophical message.  His observations about human nature are represented in the actions of the boys.  Yes, read it to b eentertained, but also read it to come to realizations about our world and nature.	1998-01-15

The natzis belived that the &quot;weak&quot; must die. Jack adopted this belief and hunted Ralf like he would a pig. Just as man relized the savagry he can perform after WWII, Ralf &quot;wept for the end of innocence&quot;. He relized that man was the lord of death and destruction.

I do not feel that The Lord of the Flies was a book advocating atavism (the return to primitive instincts) nor a book about male bonding. The Lord of the Flies deals with &quot;man's essential illness&quot; -- the potential of all human beings to exhibit an evil nature. &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is the English equivalent to Beelzebub, another name for the devil. In the book, Simon's obvious similarities to the Christ figure further the validity of an interpretation of this book as a representation of the continous conflict between good and evil within human beings -- &quot;at once heroic and sick&quot; -- and the implication of societal restraints, or a lack thereof. Reading this book will provide valuable insights into human nature as well an engaging story.	1997-10-12

One reason that so many hate it, as another reviewer pointed out, is that many were forced to read it at school which most definately would put a damper on their enthusiasm.  Another is the different ways in which people approached it.  Some came into it expecting a Swiss Family Robinson or Hatchet type book, in which a group of boys in a plane crash struggle to survive.  Many of these readers were probably appalled at much of the symbolism and Golding's strange style of writing.  Those of us who came at it expecting this type of literature were drawn into the book.  If you are the first type of reader, I would not recommend this book, but if you are the latter and haven't read it yet, read it now!  I am not going to go too far into my own interpretations of this book, but I am going to say it is one of the best pices of writing I have ever read.  Golding puts you on this island with the boys (in my opinion I don't think you are supposed to question what happened before the plane crash or how they got there.  it is irrelevant and the author doesn't give much information on it, much to the frustration of some readers) and they start out much as you would expect them to.  One boy takes command and they build their shelters, gather food, all of the things you are supposed to do in this situation.  But then things go terribly, terribly wrong and the dark side, the Id as Freud might have called it, comes to the surface and the boys become horrible savages, and you are shocked to see the children's innocent exterior melt away.  And then, at the gut-wrenching climax, they are suddenly seen again from an adult's eyes for what they really are.  This book is one of the great triumphs of all symbolic literature	1997-08-15

What is the stigma attached to this book that some many are disturbed to the point that they would shun it as Huckleberry Finn (though that's another story)? It provides perhaps the most verisimilar (and concomitantly terrifying) inscape into the innate nature of human beings. Author of this masterpiece, Richard Golding, a Nobel Laureate, advocates atavism, expounding that people are perhaps intrinsically imperfect and moreover dangerous. The veneer of English etiquette and polite mores eroded in attrition, a group of boys stranded in a plane crash devolve, their true truculence evinced, the primal potential of all manifest in their actions.^M Furthermore Golding masterully implements symbolism on many levels, handling mutliple allegories within the macrocosm of the world and the microcosm of the island, and yet He hews this imminent, immanent, threatening eminent imbroglio into a wonderful web of fantastic connections, so that all is one. There is no superfluity in this work. All is essential, all is exigent, and all is effective, entirely unfettered from tautology, redundance, or any kind of pretention (which is far more than can be said of this deplorable &quot;review&quot;). Rarely live such authors of Golding's caliber. Even less often is such an important, demanding novel produced. Reading it is requisite, particularly if We remain blind enough to ignore its painfully blatant manifestation in reality, today, yesterday, and fearfully tomorrow. Lest society fail, lest morality fall, lest ethics moulder, don't forget Beelzebub within (for &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; is, i understand, translation of the Greek transliteration/translation of the Hebrew word for demon, or perhaps even &quot;devil&quot;) It would be equally foolish to fear not the book as to ignore it and abscond, ensconced comfortably complacent, and fain free from peril of being disturbed.

The Lord of the Flies is an amazing microcosm designed to show the shortcomings of mankind.  In the story, Ralph, Piggy, Sam n Eric, Simon, and many other boys are stranded on an island by a plane crash during World War III.  All adults are killed in the crash, leaving the boys alone, and unsure of what to do.  At first, the boys enjoy a seeming utopia in their 'new world' but soon find that the thin veneer of humanity wears away very quickly.  Ralph assumes leadership, and struggles to protect his 'tribe' from internal contention and help the younger children of the group to rid their fear of the &quot;beasties&quot; that plauge them.  Each boy, from the analogical point of view, plays a part of a miniature world in their new society.  Through their interactions and reactions, we see how conformity, complascence, and love work together.  Soon though, after the chivalry is quenched with the ritual murdering of the Christ-figure, Simon, dissension occurs that leads the boys to break into two groups.  Then the boys engage in fierce battles and huntings of each other to wipe out the other group.  More killings ensue, and finally, the appearance of a ship on the island, and the captain on the beach shows what the boys are...merely boys with sticks and stones, as if it was all a game.<br />  All in all, Golding uses the microcosm to his advantage by utilizing Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs.  That man must first secure food, air, and shelter before he can find safetly and love respectively.  Once, however, the availablity of food and shelter declines, Golding shows us how quickly chivalry in society can deteriorate, leaving our bestial selves showing through the translucent outer covering of kindness and unselfishness.  Truly a masterpiece in its own right, as well as a guide.  Will you heed its warnings?	1997-02-01

I felt disengaged at numerous occasion, felt that character development it heavy handed and came short, and the pace of events quite slow to a stall, and then it builds up quite quickly in the conclusion, which holds up quite well.	2015-07-10

This book took me by surprise. When I started reading, I knew vaguely what the plot was: a group of kids gets stranded on an island and then turn savage. I also knew the book was a classic. So, I had my expectations set accordingly. To my surprise, it blew me away.<br /><br />Why is this book impressive?-- because every part of it has meaning.  The conch has meaning, how many times Ralph pushes his hair back, Piggy's glasses, the fact that Piggy remains nameless, the fact that Simon lives in a culvert: all of it. Not only that, the book as a whole is an allegory for society:  with each main character of the book representing a major part of society. Moreover, the language in the book is precise, sophisticated, and elegant: meaning that although the book is only 200 pages, it is dense and smart. Rarely have I encountered books with this level of mastery.<br /><br />As far as entertainment factor, this book was dark, adventurous, and had my attention for the whole thing. The book starts mid action, with the boys already crashed on the island. And, it doesn't take long after that before characters are clearly defined and strong emotion in the reader stirred.<br /><br />My only critique with the book is with how it was transcribed into kindle format. Whoever typed this book for kindle made a few errors. For example, on page 231, the word &#34;ulutation&#34; is written, when it should be &#34;ululation&#34;. I only noticed a few errors like this, and they were so few and minor that they didn't detract from the book.<br /><br />On the all, a thought provoking book, entertaining, and we'll written.	2015-06-28

I could see the boys’ mindsets reflected in the scenery around them, which is probably the point, but I didn’t care for the language at all. The dialogue moved along okay, but every time I hit a descriptive passage, it felt like I was dragging my way through a mucky old swamp: the action stopped so short that I wanted to fling the book across the room. (It’s a good thing I didn’t, because my copy is so old that it needs packing tape to hold it together. There are actually page clusters that will flutter out like dead leaves if I’m not careful.)<br /><br />The physical and social changes in the boys are portrayed well, though, as are many of the observations about humanity, government, civilization, and lawlessness. For instance:<br /><br />“The rules!” shouted Ralph. “You’re breaking the rules!”<br /><br />“Who cares?”<br /><br />Ralph summoned his wits.<br /><br />“Because the rules are the only thing we’ve got!”<br /><br />But Jack was shouting against him.<br /><br />“Bollocks to the rules! We’re strong — we hunt! If there’s a beast, we’ll hunt it down! We’ll close in and beat and beat and beat — !”<br /><br />Even Ralph, who was initially a powerful leader, driven to keep the signal fire alight and call for rescue, begins to lose his focus as time goes by. His sense and logic are described as sort of shutting off from time to time, and he struggles to recall the goals he has set. The longer he spends away from society, the more he struggles to retain his civility, and the other boys are even worse, turning to superstition and violence to create a new, savage way of life.<br /><br />Of course, it’s all a bit melodramatic, but I’ve always been a bit of a sucker for sensationalist fiction. I find that I’m losing this streak as time goes by, probably because I don’t see the point in panic and paranoia so much anymore, but it’s still a nice sort of story to visit here and there.<br /><br />All in all: I can see why this one is taught in schools. I imagine that this book would be more shocking and mind-blowing if you’d never read anything like it before, but since that wasn’t the case with me, I wasn’t as impressed. It’d probably be fun to teach, though, if only to hear students’ reactions to the terrors that take place.as time goes by, probably because I don’t see the point in panic and paranoia so much anymore, but it’s still a nice sort of story to visit here and there.<br /><br />All in all: I can see why this one is taught in schools.

It all takes place during the first World War, young boys are stranded on an island after their plane crashed. They are left on a desert island with no form of civil rulings. The boys try to come together to make some sort of ruling but when that falls apart they split up into tribes hunting for a beast. Piggy, Simon, Ralph and Jack are left to fend for themselves.<br />I personally didn't like the book, it holds no value or purpose to me. I feel as though there is no real pattern to follow within the story. It’s basically  a story of savages and murders. This book is almost making the inference that when parents aren't around or when there is no form of ruling, that it’s okay to act as if you've never been around civilization. This book isn't one that I would read if I didn't have too.<br />I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone but someone might like it and I just wasn't that person. If you’re into things like this then I recommend this book to you, but if you never read anything like this then I don’t think this book is for you, especially if you’re into more realistic books.	2015-03-19

I remember not liking it then and I only liked it slightly more this time. Sure there's some crisp writing (there's also surprisingly some awkward writing  like how many times Golding uses the word \\"presently\\") and the tension around the shifting loyalty of the group from Ralph as chief to Jack as warlord is interesting, still I just don't see why this book is in the pantheon of English literature. But then again I felt that way about \\"On The Road\\".  And I know everyone's immediate answer was that it was shocking or revealing for its time but think great art needs to stand the test of time and not just shine in its moment.<br /><br />When judged as an all time great I think Flies falls short. If you read it as just another novel with a message about our society I guess it's ok.	2015-02-18

My grandson had to read it in school, and when he arrived to spend the night, he said he forgot to bring his book. I went to Kindle and downloaded it for him. So convenient and no excuses for not reading. I did buy a Kindle for his mom as well, for Christmas, because she loves to read. My 89 year old mom, me, and my daughter all love to read, so it's a little troubling that our 16 year old boy doesn't have much interest in it. I try to look for a book he will not want to put down. There is such magic in reading. It takes you places you've never been. Takes you away from your own life for awhile.

Golding used the perfect set of characters for this when he chose boys, because boys (and children in general) can be very passionate and have trouble controlling their impulses, which makes for a perfect plot setup.  In terms of the characters being &#34;unrealistic,&#34; I suppose that could be said for certain parts of the story, but in general it's actually a rather accurate insight into how a group of boys with one or two jealous/cruel members might eventually fall into a pattern of savage behavior.  I didn't find any formatting problems with the book.  Overall, a nice standard edition of a keenly insightful book.	2014-12-05

It nearly put me off reading for life.<br />What could I, at 15(and female) have in common with any of these boys, all under 13?<br />I felt like my teacher was punishing us by making us read it. She was saying, 'you're all savages without adults around, this book proves it.'<br /><br />Giving it a fresh read as an adult, I can at least now articulate what annoyed me most. Aside from the sentence fragments and unattributed dialogue (seriously, five people all talking at once and no 'Ralph said', 'Samneric said?' Throw me a bone here.)<br /><br />It was written in omniscient 3rd person, but with head-hopping to tell the reader what each boy thought, while leaving the individual boys themselves in the dark. This storytelling style gives a horrible sense of unfairness to proceedings. For example, when the parachute man falls to the island, the reader knows what he is, but the boys don't, so of course they're scared. We, the reader, are not scared, so we're denied that emotion of empathy with the boys, and encouraged to look down on their behaviour.<br /> The reader is recruited to cast judgement, as if to say, 'look at these silly boys, no better than savages the lot of them.' At least now I've read it again and I can say I truly hate it, rather than simply having a memory of hating it.<br />The boys should have speared that naval officer in the goolies, then taken over the boat. I can feel a fan-fiction sequel coming on.	2014-12-01

Lord of the Flies is a book tailor-made for a middle or high school english class. it's fairly interesting, although not really a page-turner, and it has plenty of obvious symbolism and literary devices for teenagers to analyze. However, I think most critics overrate this book a little.<br /><br />I'm not saying it's a bad book. Seeing the kids attempt to rebuild society was enjoyable, and the last 20 pages or so were fantastic. But Golding has a lot of tics that make reading this book annoying at times. For one, his characters repeat dialogue over and over again. It seems intentional, meant to prove a point about people, but it doesn't make it less annoying. The main character also has an annoying habit of forgetting what he was going to say in the middle of speaking.<br /><br />All in all, I say the Lord of the Flies is a good book, just not a great one.	2014-10-27

I wouldn't advise reading this directly before bed due to some of the graphic imagery that tends to take place towards the end of some of the chapters.<br /><br />It's very allegorical, which I enjoy. It's a story about the loss of innocence, civilization vs savagery, and much more. Without ruining the ending I will say you can propagate some of the themes in the children's story up to adults and you suddenly have something that is a comment on current society and our views on war.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book.	2014-10-17

It has a ton of deep layers, some that are apparent and some that take a little digging to get to.<br /><br />Before I read this book I would say humanity at it's most basic element is good. At this stage in my life I attempt to hold on to those romantic ideals. This book is one of a few factors that made it apparent to me that my previous statement is inadequate, though I do not recant it completely.<br /><br />As you are likely aware this novel is about a group of boys who are marooned on a desert island without adults-total freedom to live the life they have always dreamed. Unfortunately, it doesn't work out like that. Their community with no outside pressure degenerates. But why?<br /><br />Some say it is because humanity is inherently evil, so their society degenerates...but I think that answer (like mine) is too simple.<br /><br />The boys' immaturity is repeatedly, frustratingly on display, and as you read you will realize it is not so much inherent evil, but more inherent immaturity. You will also notice this immaturity is not limited to adolescents or the novel, it is very apparent in much of our society today. In my opinion, rather than saying humanity is inherently evil, Golding's LOTF is more a revelation of why we need an education-- to develop ourselves past our fear/ego/scarcity into a bigger, fuller understanding of life. It reminds me of Plato's desire for philosopher-kings. The boys in LOTF are the opposite of philosopher kings. They are immature boys arguing/fighting on trivial grounds like many (most?) of our leaders throughout history.<br /><br />This book is valuable for a lot of reasons, I hope the high schoolers reading it don't get lost in the required reading and engage it on a personal level.<br /><br />The penguin edition I read has a phenomenal literary criticism section in the back, I highly recommend getting that edition and reading those excerpts if possible!	2014-09-12

I know they only charge $1.50 for it, but the publishers should still be embarrassed to put this abomination in the Kindle store. I would understand if this were something by an unknown self-published author, but for a book this famous I can't believe they wouldn't take the time to create a good e-book version. There is no styling, no publication information, and an inline table of contents at the top without any links to the chapters it references. There are also hundreds of arbitrary forced linebreaks in the middle of paragraphs, so that if you change the font size then huge parts of the book look terrible. Thankfully I know how to fix this kind of thing so my copy of the ebook looks fine now, but the publisher really should have a professional go through and clean this garbage up.

It may increase your cynacism on our species.  Great read, but proceed with caution. (everything you thought about human nature may have been wrong).  Are we inherently &#34;good&#34; or &#34;evil&#34;.  Is it &#34;nature&#34; or &#34;nurture&#34; that dictates our behavior??  Some of the questions that you will ask yourself.	2014-08-12

Two antagonists emerge, Frank who thinks that hunting is key to survival and Ralph whose main concern is to keep a fire alight in the hope to get spotted by a ship.

I am appalled by the fact that schools have this book as required reading and can say that I would be happy if I never played eyes on this again.<br /><br />The only reason that I gave this book 2 stars instead of one is because it was mildly engaging.

It seemed to drag on a bit towards the middle, but the foreshadowing and the title gave away many of the plot twist which were still delightful to see play out. By that I mean you feel bad when something bad happens even if that something only gave you five or so pages of emotional investment. You feel happy when things look up, even though you know they will get much worse. I even felt myself frantically turn pages at points just to see how exactly something would play out even if I saw it coming. I took off one star solely because I should have read this book in high school before I had so many of these wonderfully original story points relayed to me in one way or another through various films and books through the years. Basically, it lived up to what I was expecting but still left a bitter taste and some unfulfilled sense of more when I finished. While this speaks volumes to the investment I found myself having in the story at the end, it's only because I had to trudge though so much in the middle, and just to a point where I finally accepted what the book was offering before it snatched those things away. My recommendation is to read this book with as open a mind as possible, and even at the boring rough patches to keep going because the final chapter is so well done it earned three stars for that alone.	2014-06-04

Reading it for pleasure just brought much more time to think about the story's meaning. The break down of society, leadership types, and the value of all people. This is a book that is meant for ages of mid to late tens to all adults. It's fast reading and the story is seamless. Perfect stories that will be enjoyed as similar are, George Orwell's, &#34;1984&#34;, and &#34;Animal Farm&#34;. These three books tell us to, &#34;Watch society, now and in the future; learn from the past&#34;.	2014-05-24

It teaches you a lot of morals though such as self-responsibility. I mean, it starts with two characters: Piggy and Ralph who meet other kids on the island they just landed on. Especially Jack, Simon and the twins Sam'n'Eric. Each has a task but it's seems harder to follow it when inside your heart all you think about is a magical boat or plane to cone by. Would recommend if you really like reading together in family a Sunday night around the fireplace.	2014-05-12

Its depiction of innate evil helped me understand the nature of humanity. And though institutions can and do oppress the defenseless, the creators have designed these structures to maximize their (the creators') gains at the expense of others. So in the end, the nature of the systems reveals the nature of humanity.<br /><br />William Golding in The Lord of the Flies shows how innate evil surfaces when civilization's rules and moral codes no longer suppress human impulses, a view that Freud would probably take issue. For Golding, social norms and civil laws construct rather than suppress humanity. Jack represents the beast that seeks self-gratification at the expense of others; while Piggy the reasoning that has led humankind from darkness to enlightenment. When Jack and his group destroy the conch, a symbol of law and order, and steal Piggy's glasses, a symbol of reason and science, they were asserting savagery over civilization, much like the barbarians ransacking Rome and leading Europe into the Dark Ages.<br /><br />Ralph tries to maintain a semblance of civilization, but Jack lures more and more members from the group and of those who stand by him, Piggy is killed and the twins Sam and Eric are tortured until they submit. In the end, Jack has to run for his life and only when the naval office arrives, when the instruments of law and order reassert themselves, does he escape death. He could not save himself anymore than he could Piggy.<br /><br />A bleak picture of humanity William Golding has painted. We would like to believe that children are innocent and that society baptizes them into evil. When children kill other children, we would like to find the parent or teacher or school or church that has corrupted them. And often enough, we do find it. But Golding reminds that there is more fundamental source of evil.<br /><br />Of course, in the novel, Golding didn't consider that social norms and moral codes are also human constructs, and at times, their designers have hidden agendas. Individuals can and do exploit the legal, financial and political systems to benefit themselves. And although, unlike olden times, now the law applies to everyone, some can better protect themselves against exploits while others can sneak through loopholes. Still, The Lord of the Flies gives great insight into the human heart.sider that social norms and moral codes are also human constructs, and at times, their designers have hidden agendas.

This book is quite a read, even though it is short, the characters are well-developed and you will be empathetic with them. However this book is written with a formula I personally quite dislike. It has no action or excitement at the beginning and saves it all for the last quarter, or so, of the book. The allusions to World War II are simply fantastic and are hidden; someone who enjoys a good challenge (like me) would love to find out these connections but I must say a lot of them are quite simple. All in all, this book is one you should definitely read and is one which I enjoyed quite a bit.	2014-05-10

I could not keep up with the characters except for Ralph, Piggy, and Jack. Too much description of their surroundings but not enough on their character development. This is supposed to be a classic and is on many high school reading list. With this in mind, this was the only reason why I made myself read the entire book. I kept waiting for the big moment of what made this book so great. It finally got there on the last 30 pages. I feel sorry for the students who have to read this. This will surely discourage kids from reading if they think this is how a story is written. I read it &#34;for fun&#34; but didn't find much enjoyment in it thus my 2 stars because it did pick up in the final 30 pages.	2014-04-30

This novel is basically a masterpiece of literature that has truly lasted the test of time. It's a work of art that I found interesting, and even amusing at times.

It can get boring due to no change of scenery. I would recommend this to around eight grade and up due to light violence.	2014-04-02

I have never been stranded on an island but I have seen groups of seemingly mature, intelligent and capable persons decline into little more than savages. These lads attempted to develop a social group based on what they knew. Unfortunately they were unable to keep their plans stable and the plan went completely awry.

I'm sure it was good back then, and even shocking with the brutality of it's youth. But it does not have the same effect in this day and age, unlike some books, like 1984 and Fahrenheit 451. The characters were flat, with very little actual personality, it did not engage until almost the end, and by that time it was already too far gone for me. And as far as the shocking youth brutality is concerned, The Hunger Games showcased it better. While this book was written ages ago, and you truly cannot compare them, what I am saying is this, such ideas are better executed now, so it is difficult to truly enjoy it.	2014-03-25

Skip the book watch the movie	While a decent plot (the savage tendencies of humans) I found this book to be lacking in several areas. First and foremost, how inexperienced was the editor? I spent the first half of the book rereading passages several times trying to figure out which character was talking or in the spotlight at that moment. When you have a large group of boys the pronoun \\"he\\" can only be used so many times and certainly shouldn't be used continuously without proper identity. I felt that the author wrote this book in a hurry. I know that it is noted as a classic but I feel so much more could have been achieved as far as character development. The end of the book seemed too convenient to me. I fail to see how a ship could have gotten to the island so quickly after spotting the smoke. I think this is the only time in all my years of reading that I would suggest watching the movie over reading the book.	2014-03-05

The story captures the essential nature of the darker side of humanity, especially distilled by the youth, the not yet fully-civilized boys bereft of the guidance of any mentor. The lowest common denominator of the rule of the jungle forms up out of fear of the unknown and out of a will to personal power on the part of one of the older boys. It's not a pretty story. It seems to be a warning of what human civilization could easily slip into under duress…and if one reads the news one realizes that such slips into the depths of the jungle do in fact take place over and over again when there is great duress.	2014-01-18

I'm sure my rating of four stars is biased due to my age and having a 13 year old son.<br /><br />I found the book was a fast read, but one that didn't set well with me due to the content and message the author put forward. Would young boys devolve so quickly in the absence of strong adult leadership? I also wonder if the boys coming from a British boarding school would have a different outcome than boys of the 21st Century.<br /><br />I did find the book a compelling read, and an interesting look at leadership, survival, and moral decency. If nothing else, the book imparts on the reader the importance of raising up young men with strong, ethical examples so they can make the right choices in stressful times.	2014-01-06

This tale of a group of educated young English boys stranded on an island and their slow decent into savagery was, I imagine, quite horrifying in its day. The thought of such fine Britain youth becoming blood thirsty savages while a few tried to remain \\"Human\\" in just a few months must have really been thought of in only the realm of the utter fantastically impossible. At one point, one child even goes so far as to say: \\" we are English after all, and we're the best at everything, hey what?\\" Well, I'm not the best at book reviews, so I'll just leave this one with a thought. ...Imagine what a today's type remake of this particular  movie ( with Zombies, and Vampires, and , Lycans and even shark tornadoes running loose) would be like? But seriously. As I read this old classic the difference in the language and the bounds of censorship have gone so far beyond this truly disturbing tale, it was  all I could think about was; my God what a truly horrid story they could make out of this old yarn. As it is. It should be mandatory reading in junior high schools for two reasons. 1) to show today's youth a truly shocking story of the human id placed under great stress. And 2) it would be a wonderful pro and con debate on the evolution of a number of points. Writing style changes. How stress can lead even the most innocent to the brink of savagery. The possibilities are endless as a teaching tool.	2013-12-13

The vocabulary is way, way too hard. Not challenging-in-a-good-way, but ridiculously difficult and unproductive for an 8th grade student. The &#34;lessons,&#34; the &#34;moral,&#34; (if considered worthwhile) can be taught via a short story or not at all. The tone is haughty at the end - like an adult who feels like he has given the world a great gift in his writing. Realistically, he has given most 8th grade students consternation and a feeling of failure. If read at all, it should be done at a slow pace, in class, with a teacher pointing out the literary techniques and reviewing every new vocabulary word (which will be many per page). If, in the past, this was interesting to youngsters as a way to understand, and vicariously experience, aggression and &#34;savagery,&#34; then it no longer has a purpose. Our present culture, unfortunately, has ample opportunities for youngsters to walk through these dark sides of human nature.	2013-11-14

The boys have to learn how to make their own food, look after themselves, make shelters, and make fires. They select Ralph to be the leader. Ralph, \\"the boy with fair hair\\", is twelve years old and tries to keep the boys in order by making rules, \\"'We've got to have rules and obey them. After all, we're not savages. We're English, and the English are best at everything'\\", but the boys don't follow the rules. Piggy is Ralph's sidekick who helps him make the rules and think of ways to help them survive longer. Piggy is slightly chubby so the boys make fun of him for that, especially Jack. Jack is the hunter; he finds the pigs and kills them for food. He tries to be just as high up as Ralph, but not as many people like Jack as much as they like Ralph. Soon enough Ralph and Piggy realize that the pigs are not the only ones being hunted, but they are too. The theme of this book is civilization vs. savagery. The boys have to try to keep themselves sane while they are on this deserted island.  I liked how the author switched from Ralph, Piggy, and Jack and told from their point of view. It helped me to get a better insight on what was going on. I really liked the book I would give it a 10/10	2012-12-17

With all the different scholastic reading options out there, why is this book still on our kids reading lists?  I read it thirty years ago and recently read it again because my kids had too.  The language is archaic.  The imagery is impossible to grasp.  And the subject matter is macabre, not that I have a big issue with that but lets move on already.

When my 13 year-old grandson said he was reading it in school, I ordered it on my kindle so we could read and discuss together.<br /><br />There is a certain naivet&eacute; in Golden's, writing style. Perhaps it is the British to American language nuance or possibly, it is his mastery of writing that presents the essence of the story with naivet&eacute;, for indeed, in the beginning, the boys are innocent, only becoming more savage as the book progresses and the leaders (Ralph and Jack) strive for order and then control.<br /><br />I find it interesting to read this story as an adult. As a youth, I recall it being an decent story of survival among the elements as well as each other. As an adult, I can step back and see how the story depicts the evolution of 'man'hood and politics teeming with greed and lust for power. I do wonder where the story would have taken us if it had been young girls who found themselves on an uncharted island-now there's a story to be told.	2012-11-06

Probably the most significant of these symbols was the conch. The conchs characterized several things, including independence and stability on the island, and possibly, even for a short time, harmony between the boys. One of the most motivating characteristics to the conch was the fact that Piggy couldn't use it. This shows a deficiency of control or power on Piggy's part. As the tale progressed, this routine shrank more and more, until the isle was a dwelling of broad chaos and mayhem.<br />I love its break down and build up in society.  I love books like this and enjoy the psychological thinking that must be modified in order to do this.  I find as I grow older the simple way a belief system can be created in a community...is fascinating.  Lord of the Flies is THE most classic example of this procedure.	2012-10-19

As far as a story goes, it's engaging.  The characters aren't anything special from a literary perspective.  I'm not a big person on reading into the symbolism behind everything in a book, so much of the appeal and social critique of LOTF was lost on me.  Some parts were confusing, and I'm still trying to figure out why the title is what it is (the pig head on the pole seemed like a minor incident).<br /><br />At the end, I was left with a feeling of 'meh.'  But that's just me.  If you want fun and adventure, you're probably best to look elsewhere.  If you want to read a critique of human nature and the fall of society, you've got it.

Overall, it was a fairly enjoyable read.  I'd recommend it to people above the age of 14 because it's very wordy, and it may take quite some patience to get through it.<br /><br />Golding is a very verbose writer.  He can spend an entire page detailing one quality of the island.  It gets to be a little annoying sometimes, especially when the sometimes unnecessary details take the reader away from the story, and by the time Golding gets back to the plot, you've forgotten what the characters are doing and why.  I will admit that sometimes, the wordiness got to be bad enough so that I'd skip over paragraphs with no dialogue and continue when the first character spoke, and I'd find that I didn't miss anything by not reading three entire pages on how the beaches shimmered under the noontide sun.<br /><br />But the book really picks itself up at the end, when Golding stops using so many details and the book concludes strongly.  The last few pages are stronger than every page before it.<br /><br />Plus, Golding tells a great story through the book.  No matter how much detail he uses, he is still a great writer, and this book really shows the symbolism he can use to build the settings, quirky and sometimes risky allusions to then-current events, and the ways the characters each served a role in giving the island its personality.<br /><br />A powerful read - definitely great for a class!  It requires a lot of thought and even more patience.  It's worth it by the end, though.	2012-05-19

The novel titled \\"The Lord of the Flies\\" cannot be simply defined as a simple novel, it is also a good source for reasoning about the indefinite border between the good and evil of our souls.<br />The most philosophical question is the following:<br /><br />\\"What are we? Humans? Or animals? Or savages? What's grown-ups going to think? Going off--hunting pigs--letting fires out--and now!\\"<br /><br />If we consider that in this novel there is not a feminine figure I can argue that the human being (after the nuclear conflict) is almost destined to disappear because the female is a crucial part of the society not only as a synonymous of reproduction but mainly as the most rational and intelligent part of the humanity (See Piggy and Jack).<br /><br />\\"The Conch\\" is synonimous of democracy made of condivisible and established a priori made of rules but is also extremely fragile.<br /><br />In my opinion \\"The Beast\\" is a radiography of our  souls which is localized somewhere inside our minds, after a series of facts it will emerge violently the animal side of our personality.<br /><br />Cheers<br />IP	2011-12-22

Not with this one.  When a group of boys crashes on an island they are supposed to take this opportunity to make a dream society.  In Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, that definitely does not happen.  Instead, kids turn savage and no one can tell good from evil.<br /><br />During World War II, a group of boys' plane crashes on an island.  Only the boys survive.  Everything seems ideal - there are no adults around and there appears to be enough food and water.  But what happens when all the food and water runs out?  The boys decide to have an election on the leadership of their tribe.  It so happens that a boy named Ralph gets elected and appoints his opponent Jack to be the leader of the hunters.  But then Jack wants more.  He wants to be the leader.  He takes all the boys (except Ralph, Samneric, and Piggy) and turns them into savages.  Jack and his co-leader Roger think they are doing good for the boys who want to have fun, but then the signal fire goes out.  The hope of a rescue is gone.  Now Jack and Roger candidly pursue Ralph, Piggy and Samneric.  What will happen if one of them gets captured?<br /><br />I think that the two main points of Lord of the Flies are firstly, that being evil is easier than being is good.  When you are evil your conscience goes away - you don't feel bad for people you hurt.  The only feeling you have left is for yourself and then sometimes you don't know that you hurt people.  When you are good it is possible to feel for others. Secondly, I think that William Golding is trying to make a point that an evil society can't last. Sure, it can form easily, but it can't last. This is because evil is an all wanting thing. If you are evil you probably will try to get to the top by force while other people are doing the same thing. Then every bit of structure falls to bits and pieces.	2011-12-01

It was not taught at the high school I went to, but I was always curious about this book. I actually listened to it on CD in my car and found myself wishing my hour-long commute was longer - I was that riveted! This book is a peak inside the human psyche - a lesson in what separates us from the animal kingdom - and what can send us back. I found myself fascinated, full of questions. Are we really only several rules away from being savages? Do we instinctively know this and that is why the majority of us live peaceably within society's \\"norms\\"?

Humans, in any setting, can default towards their darker nature. Golding concedes that we have this nature but the moral of his story is that we must struggle to overcome it. Analogous to experimental design in a laboratory, Lord of the Flies is Golding's research study. In an effort to control for all variables, the research design encompasses subjects, pre-adolescent males, placed on a deserted island isolated from all societal variables. His hypothesis is that, inherent in human nature, if there are enough people to form groups, they will form factions and go to war. His experiment illustrates the darker side of human nature by controlling for as many factors as possible.<br /><br />Early in the experiment, the subjects attempt to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with the political and social order of modern British society. Ralph, the natural leader, and Piggy, the detached intellectual, attempt to hold parliamentary assemblies, build living quarters and schedule common duties. However, as time passes, Jack and his `tribe' break off from Ralph's chiefdom in order to avoid all forms of thankless toil and drudgery while enjoying superior opportunities for `fun' lifestyles. Jack is solely interested in hunting which for him encompasses plunder, tribute, and glory. Ultimately, murder, mayhem and debauchery ensue. Through free will, the boys drift towards humanity's darker nature. Golding's experiment demonstrated that evil cannot be blamed on someone else or another culture because we are all inherently capable of evil.<br /><br />Golding wrote Lord of the Flies in the wake of World War II. The cold war was in high gear and people were still wondering about how the Holocaust could have happened. The book represents an effort to answer the question, \\"Why do humans keep doing such awful things to each other?\\" During the story, the reader is reminded of the outside world of adult war. Although not expounded upon, the reason the boys are stranded on the island is due to an atomic war that led to the boys being evacuated on planes.  Later in the story, as a sign from the outside world, a pilot is shot down, apparently dies in the crash, and lands on the island. The dead body becomes the unseen mystical `beastie' that the boys fear in their nightmares. For Golding, war is a societal evil. Golding reduces the greater evil to its lowest common denominator to show that war is not caused by an evil leader or evil country; the enemy is within.ugh not expounded upon, the reason the boys are stranded on the island is due to an atomic war that led to the boys being evacuated on planes.

This book is one of the best, sitting next to  all the other William Golden books.

Being a perfectly vivid book with deep meaning and descriptive plots, the author, William Golding, puts deep meaning to this book in a most subtle way that immature ro inadequate readers cannot truly appreciate or find.<br />FOOTNOTES:<br />The deeper meaning of this book  ladies and gentlemen, is actually an allegory, a piece of writing that means or symbolises something by using character use or plots. In this book, the group of boys stranded on the island symbolises the human race. Jack is the major antagonist and symbol of the darkness and th interior rages and evilness that we hold within each and every one of us. Ralph symbolises the good within ourselves... But it's not my job to help you all with your reading homework.	2009-12-13

Which is better, law and rescue, or hunting and breaking things up?\\" (p. 162).  Published in 1954, this amazing piece of work illustrates society and society's reaction to isolation apart from law.  The knowledgeable Piggy, one of the many characters in the novel The Lord of the Flies, articulated this quote.  This novel shows a group of young boys stranded on an island after their plane was shot down and the pilot killed.  All by themselves, the juvenile, vigorous boys are trying to get off the island and get home ... or are they?  Selfishness and a lust for power undermine the aim for rescue.  While a few of the boys are working hard to obtain liberation from the atoll, several are obsessed with the thought of acquiring supremacy and relishing in the freedom and separation from their previous normal, boring lives with rules and adults.<br /><br /> This story, furthermore, examines the hearts and motivations of mankind.  The message is that deep down inside of us as humans is a bent toward evil.  The author, William Golding, presents this point by demonstrating that when there is no one around to enforce law, evil comes out of the boys and, consequently, causes much mayhem and destruction.  \\"The beast struggled forward, broke the ring and fell over the steep edge of the rock to the sand by the water. At once the crowd surged after it, poured down the rock, leapt on to the beast, screamed, struck, bit, tore. There were no words, and no movements but the tearing of teeth and claws\\" (p. 136).  This quote shows how brutal and savage the boys have become.  They strike with a mob mentality mistaking one of their own for the \\"beast.\\"  Earlier in the novel, this very character makes a prophetic statement about the beast while addressing the group: \\"What I mean is ... maybe it's only us\\" (p. 77).  He is saying that the beast, whatever it is, is the evil within themselves.<br /><br /> Lord of the Flies is an exciting and riveting story that captures your heart.  Some critics say the book ends rather abruptly, but others feel strongly that the ending is consistent with the author's purpose.  The reader is left with a sense of contrast where instant law and order replaces chaos.  Rich imagery and symbolism are discovered throughout the book and personal introspection is promoted.  The book also causes the reader to take a deeper look at and analyze the true condition of the heart and soul of man and the role of society in maintaining morality.

US	49056791	RGGFBTCITOC2X	B000OCXIRG	502818647	Lord of the Flies	Digital_Ebook_Purchase	4	0	0	N	N	Wasted on schoolkids	William Golding's first novel has been read, most probably by most people, when they were at school as Lord of the Flies has long been a staple text of GCSE English classes. As a result many people read it at an age where they are filleting its pages for 'symbols' to be reprocessed in exam answers, and sniggering at innuendos such as blowing the conch.     All of which is a shame, as Lord of the Flies articulates a theme of the innate savage just under the surface of civilized man. A trope that has spawned a thousand imitators in films and books since, but Golding's novel was probably the first. Beginning as a deceptively simple fable about some well educated British schoolboys stranded on an island after a plane crash, the allegorical story traces their descent into frenzied barbarisim.     Golding himself was a schoolmaster for a number of years, and he knows exactly what boys are like. If they are not strictly regulated and controlled, chaos is the inevitable result.	2009-05-08

In this world the story is weak, predictable, laboriously plotted, written in rather lame language festering with pronouns and descriptions that paint no picture.<br /><br />The innocence of the age in which the book was written shows through and through:  things that the author intended to be shocking pale in comparison with daily news stories of today.	2008-06-04
