This is an extraordinary meditation on the nature of invisibility, how one becomes invisible, what it means, and the limits of what one can do to recover some visibility, some corporeal essence, when the world around you not only does not recognize you, but cannot or will not even see you in the first place.  Yes, the novel has flaws, but the deeper truth within does not exceed one's grasp and is ultimately transcendent.  Sure, you can pick nits, but in so doing is exposed, perhaps, the effort to render the work itself invisible.  Take a chance.

Essential reading.","What makes this so effective, I think, is that Ellison basically goes after everyone, black or white. Smug communists, preachers, paternalistic Jim Crow southerners, uncle-toms, crackers, black-nationalists, murderously racist cops, rioters, captains of industry: the profoundly wealthy and the profoundly destitute alike, ad infinitum.<br /><br />But Ellison isn't simply venting wrath and disillusionment (though this book contains plenty of that), he's also showing the hyperbolic ironies and the morbidly humorous contradictions of what it means to be a black American at this time. To be labelled, defended, pilloried, explicated and manipulated to such an extent as to be effectively 'unseen.'<br /><br />Even in the post-civil rights era, how much has really changed? There are descriptions in this book of racial tensions that could be ripped straight from T.V. in 2015. Ellison's take on police brutality, race riots, looting, ghetto fires, etc. which culminate in the books staggering final chapter have a frightening and all too obvious resonance in the supposedly 'enlightened' world of 2015.<br /><br />As powerful and as beautiful as Ellison's voice is (there are passages in Invisible Man which can stand toe to toe with anything produced in Modern American fiction), as full of righteous indignation and a hugely humanistic self-awareness as it is... Invisible Man is still a first novel, and it shows. When the characters aren't completely iconic, they are almost anemic, and the plotting and pacing can be a bit clunky at times, especially in the books middle chapters. But the finale is so searing, so well done, and so eerily familiar, that I didn't really care if it had some obvious flaws. Damn right it's a classic. Highly Recommended.",2015-05-16

The narrator of this novel never mentions his name so that added more intrigue into who he was. The speaker started out early on by referring to himself as being an “invisible man.”  He obviously wasn’t truly invisible but this was a metaphor that the narrator used because he felt that those around he chose not to see him.<br /><br />The narrator was very good at public speaking and was invited to speak in front of a group of white men from the city that he was living in. He did so well that he won the prize, which was a scholarship to a high-ranking black college. The only thing was that before he claimed his prize the white men made a mockery of him by forcing him fight blind folded against the other black youth who participated in a “battle royal.” This was one of the first times in the book that the narrator’s true invisibility was shown. He was skilled enough to show his talent as a speaker and won the prize, but the men still didn’t view him with the respect that he deserved.<br /><br /> Eventually the narrator went to the college and was doing well there. While there the narrator is asked to give Mr. Norton who is a white trustee of the college a ride around. While riding the two men come across Jim Trueblood who is a poor black man from the city who is know for getting his own daughter pregnant. When Mr. Norton learns more about Jim who is so disgusted that he tells the narrator to take him to get a drink. While at the saloon a fight breaks out between two black former war veterans and Mr. Norton passes out.<br /><br />Once they returned to the school Dr. Bledsoe learns of the days events that take place between the narrator and Mr. Norton and becomes so upset at the narrator for not showing Mr. Norton a more glamorous tour that he expels him from the school. Dr. Bledsoe does give the narrator some letters of recommendation enclosed in a letter to take up to New York where there are other white school trustees. When the narrator travels to New York he ends up in Harlem where he finds the letters to be of no good use. He meets Mr. Emerson and his son who opens up the letter and informs the narrator that quickly that he has been deceived. The letter isn’t a recommendation but rather describes the narrator as being lazy and untrustworthy. This is another moment where the narrators feeling of being invisible is once again true.<br /><br />Mr. Emerson’s son gets the narrator a job working at Liberty Paints where he worked for Mr. Brockway. There is a dynamic here of the black narrator working for a company that makes optic white paint. His employment is short lived because Mr. Brockway doesn’t fully trust the narrator and they eventually get into a fight that ultimately leaves the narrator unconscious and in a hospital from a tank exploding during their tussle. Once the narrator left the hospital he later collapsed in the street and some members of the community took him to the home of Mary, who was a very nice woman who cared for and nursed him back to good health.<br /><br />The narrator gave a passionate speech one day after seeing an elderly black couple getting evicted from their home. Brother Jack who offered him a job to work for the brotherhood after hearing his speech. The narrator was trained and quickly rose to a high role within the organization while delivering numerous speeches. Jealousy arises within the group towards the narrator and he is accused of trying to use the group to further his own personal goals. The brotherhood moves him to work another post for women’s rights and one evening after a speech he meets a white woman who attempts to seduce him to indulge in acts that she has already fanaticized about with a black man. This was one of many scenarios in this book that touched on race relations of this time.<br /><br />He is called by the brotherhood to return to his original post in Harlem with the group and quickly realizes that many things have changed and a lot of members that he once knew have left. After the funeral of Clifton who dies at the hand of the police the narrator gives a speech on Clifton’s life that infuriates the brotherhood. After more disagreements about their philosophical difference the brotherhood send men to try and kill the narrator. He is forced to disguise himself to hide from these men. Once the narrator tries to escape Ras’ men who are trying to lynch him and the police who feel that he is s thief from the riots he falls into a manhole underneath the city streets.<br /><br />Underground is where the narrator stays after this point. The narrator realizes that he must continue to find himself and must honor his own individuality. The invisible man title is a perfect title for this story and what it represents. The man is now living underground stealing electricity from the Monopolated Light and Power Company. He is writing a story about his life that is currently invisible to others because they cannot physically see him and about the life that he lived above the ground where he was physically visible yet people chose not to see him.<br /><br />Sources:<br /><br />http://bpi.edu/ourpages/auto/2010/5/11/36901472/Ralph%20Ellison%20-%20Invisible%20Man%20v3_0.pdf<br /><br />https://apstudyguides.wikispaces.com/Invisible+Mant touched on race relations of this time.<br /><br />He is called by the brotherhood to return to his original post in Harlem with the group and quickly realizes that many things have changed and a lot of members that he once knew have left.

He runs circles attempting to appease first his desires to become an educated orator in pre-Civil Rights Act America, then a trustee of the state college for blacks and finally the members of the Brotherhood. His ambitions are futile in the face of his socially corrupt world. In the beginning of the novel, it is the narrator’s immaturity that keeps him for realizing that white man is toying with his aspirations. Later on, however, he gains experience from the extent to which white man has damaged all of the Brotherhood’s motives for equality and he comes to see that even the blacks who claim to be in the forefront of the fight are guilty of corruption.<br /><br />Ralph Ellison is a genius author who I believe has successfully highlighted the effects societal ideologies have limited the complexity of people’s introspective identities. Also, Ellison has conveyed that institutionally advanced ideologies are too simplistic to do any justice at successfully portraying human identity.<br /><br />Ellison’s existential depiction of racism in 1940s American brought new light to the topic on a psychological standpoint. The invisible man is broken down after making the realization that although his motives were backed by his own desire to advance himself; these motives had always been distractions from the fact that everyone had been taking advantage of him. On top of this fact, he has never had the ability to express his own personality and therefore is unable to be himself. The inability to find one’s identity is central to existential thought but the border present in the narrator’s life that hinders his ability to express himself in society is not philosophical, its physical.

At once mordantly satirical—even funny—Ellison’s novel moves as a kind of picaresque from one scene of racially charged humiliation and degradation to the next. Our unnamed narrator, the “invisible man,” moves from his beginnings in an all-black college (where he is expelled by force of contingent circumstance) to the difficult struggles of Harlem, where he is immersed in the intractable conflicts of American race-labor relations. Ellison takes us through opaquely bureaucratic, even Kafkaesque scenes of opportunity, failure, and incoherent condemnation. We find ourselves embedded in the world of American communism, where the Negro is but an ornament for the sake of progressive politics (but never taken seriously as an autonomous subject). Ellison’s America is a nightmarish, arcane, and stridently irrational society where the black individual is rendered existentially dispensable. This book also remains an all-too-relevant critique of post-racial politics. No serious American can fail to pass through Ellison’s complex furnace of our essential political disaster.",2014-12-24

You don't exist--can't you see that?\\"" (p. 141).  This is how the black president of the Negro college our unnamed protagonist is attending sets the young student straight.  And it comes hard on the heels of another bold series of statements about the world both he (our protagonist) and he (the college president) inhabit:  \\""Negroes don't control this school or much of anything else--haven't you learned even that?  No, sir, they don't control this school, nor white folks either.  True, they support it, but I control it.  I's big and black and I say `Yes, suh' as loudly as any burrhead when it's convenient, but I'm still the king down here.  I don't care how much it appears otherwise.  Power doesn't have to show off.  Power is confident, self-assuring, self-starting and self-stopping, self-warming and self-justifying.  When you have it, you know it.  Let the Negroes snicker and the crackers laugh!  Those are the facts, son.  The only ones I even pretend to please are big white folk, and even those I control more than they control me.  This is a power set-up, son, and I'm at the controls.  You think about that.  When you buck against me, you're bucking against power, rich white folk's power, the nation's power--which means government power!\\"" (p. 142).<br /><br />And as if that weren't conclusive enough, \\""(w)ell, that's the way it is.  It's a nasty deal and I don't always like it myself.  But you listen to me:  I didn't make it, and I know that I can't change it.  But I've made my place in it and I'll have every Negro in the country hanging on tree limbs by morning if it means staying where I am\\"" (p. 143).<br /><br />For our protagonist, it's an education of sorts -- not in class or race consciousness, but in something much more Machiavellian.  And while the context is not the traditional master-slave one we've all seen and read so much about, the lesson is at least as brutal -- coming, as it does, from one (older) black man to another (younger) one.<br /><br />A few chapters later, we learn the real truth about this college president -- and it's not pretty, or even collegiate.  It's just downright scoundrelly, manipulative, and evil.<br /><br />A similar sentiment comes to light further on in Ellison's novel when our protagonist finds himself in desperate straits in a paint factory on Long Island.  He now needs a job, and he's been steered into this one by circumstances indirectly engineered by the same college president.  This sentiment, however, is expressed by another black man whose rung on the social ladder is considerably lower than any our protagonist has yet had to deal with.  \\""`That's all right then.  I have to watch them personnel fellows.  One of them thinks he's going to git me out of here, when he ought to know by now he's wasting his time.  Lucis Brockway not only intends to protect hisself, he knows how to do it!  Everybody knows I been here ever since there's been a here -- even helped dig the first foundation.  The Old Man hired me, nobody else; and, by God, it'll take the Old Man to fire me!'\\""<br /><br />Finally, there's a much longer episode in which our protagonist finds himself part of the Brotherhood--which may in fact be symbolic and based on Ellison's own life, or may not be.  Are the rants of those in the Brotherhood reminiscent of those who considered themselves part of the avant-garde in the early Socialist movement?  I could conjecture, but I'd prefer not to.  What I will say, however, is that I found it surprisingly easy to substitute `Comrade' for `Brother' every time I read it.  Perhaps the following paragraph on p. 505 is most indicative of Ellison's take on the whole matter (even if only through his mouthpiece character):<br /><br />\\""`Look at me!  Look at me!' I said.  `Everywhere I've turned(,) somebody has wanted to sacrifice me for my good--only they were the ones who benefited.  And now(,) we start on the old sacrificial merry-go-round.  At what point do we stop?  Is thisthe new true definition, is Brotherhood a matter of sacrificing the weak?  If so, at what point do we stop?'\\""<br /><br />An Oops! occurs on p. 427:  \\""...but here again I was balked.\\""  That I know of, \\""balk,\\"" when used as a verb, can only be used intransitively and in the active voice.

They're the same gripes I'd have about most anyone's debut novel:  the dialogue is at times amateurish, and the scene shifts are much too abrupt.  Moreover, I feel he exaggerates a great many situations in order to make his point.  As a result, his writing frequently feels didactic when not downright propagandistic.

I was surprised in the similarities and differences the book has to the movie. The scenes are rearranged from the book to make visual (or invisible) sense as a movie script.<br /><br />A man all warped up in bandages except for his large pink nose requires a room at the inn and pays well. Slowly the Innkeeper and her companions suspect there is more to his than just a man with bandages. Everyone in a while they glimpse light where there should not be. And the stranger is so cranky that the money may not be worth the trouble of keeping him. Soon there are strange happenings and the cat is out of the bag sort of speaking.<br /><br />The trail leads to murderer and a possible reign of terror. Read more to find out where the secret is reviled and how a man named Griffin got in this situation.<br /><br />If I had read this story a year ago I would have said it was a fairly well put together sci-fi story. I would just enjoy the writing and wonder how H.G. came up with the idea. However now after reading much of H.G.'s political writings I see that this is a thinly veiled social commentary. We find that unlike the movie where Griffin goes mad in the invisibility process, that in the book Griffin was always amoral and anything stressful could set him off. Also, somewhere out there is a couple of floating eyes that belong to a cat.<br /><br />Now one habit that H .G. has in most of his tales is that just when you think he is finished on the subject, he will go off in another direction with some sub plot he has slipped in earlier. Therefore, what should have been a short story becomes a novel. Another good example of his witting style can be found in \\""The Food of the Gods.\\""",2014-08-02

It can be a real eye-opener for those who did not know the extent of what was going on at that time in certain parts of our nation.<br /><br />Plot<br />- Unnamed narrator tells his life story from about the time that he graduated from high school.<br />- Documents all of the events that changed his life, both good and bad.<br />- Narrator gets expelled from his college and has to move to find work in hopes of returning to school.<br />- Many problems arise throughout his search for a job with his letters from the head of his college.<br /><br />Setting<br />- Story begins in the South.<br />- Through an unfortunate turn of events the setting moves to New York<br /><br />Characterization<br />- The narrator begins as a college student who is eager to please all of those above him in authority as well as the white men associated with the school.<br />- Throughout the story many problems arise in the narrator’s life in which he must choose a certain solution.<br />- These problems that come up shape the narrator into who he is at the end of the novel, an invisible man.<br /><br /> Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what life was like for a black male back then as well as anyone who wants to experience severe oppression to some extent.",2014-05-01

But if you would tell me who I am, at least take the trouble to discover where I have been.\\"" ~ Ralph Ellison from \\""The World and the Jug\\""<br /><br />While conceiving this masterpiece of American fiction, Ralph Ellison was faced with a confluence of several political and artistic forces whose elements formed the landscape navigated by its protagonist.  The wind of the Harlem Renaissance had swept through Black communities in New York providing them with a flourishing of art both as a political weapon and cultural instrument of intrinsic value.  The social decompression of the war economy expanded available spaces for self actualization inspiring pursuit of a Black cultural theory in the post-Reconstruction period.  The New Negro Movement sought to extend the DuBoisian notion of the Talented Tenth and brought intellectual convergence around the establishment of a shared Negro identity.  World War I created a vacuum in able bodied men to run the Northern industrial sector.  The Great Migration drew a flood of urban workers into these cities to take the place of those deployed on the front line.  Communism having marinated as an ideological conversation during the previous century came into its own as a governing philosophy becoming the object of suspicion for a rising geopolitical authority in the United States.  The Black community in America with its teeming masses of disdainful victims of capitalism became the center of contention between these two doctrines until the decline of Black radicalism in the Reagan era.  The Great Depression arose to flatten society with a cataclysmic impact sufficient to erase any prior political and economic gain.<br /><br />His childhood and formative years spent in a diverse middle class community of Oklahoma City would buttress him from the stark urban naturalism which became the literary pulp of Richard Wright.  A rich artistic life filled with musical study and immersion in classical literature formed the crux of a writer who considered art a personal truth requiring no express political intent to merit its validation.  His desire to write from this apolitical perspective is deeply ironic considering that Invisible Man went on to become one of the most politicized works of modern fiction.  For each succeeding generation, it has served as a foil for negotiating affairs of race, class, identity and social construction while justifying its position as a premier text in the African American literary canon.  Invisibility and cultural intersection as rendered bare by Ellison remain subjects to be scrutinized even as Blackness becomes a more highly visible mainstream phenomenon.  This restructuring of spatial terms should inspire us to interrogate the invisible space which once proscribed the occupancy of Black people within this nation.  How do we confront gender, sexual, class and immigrant invisibility in such a manner that we do not become a dogmatic Brotherhood overriding the political perspective of others with no regard for the qualities of their particular oppression?<br /><br />In his brutal opening visage, Ellison fleshes out a rough sketch of the characteristics of invisibility explored in the course of the narrative.  The protagonist arrives at a gathering of the most respected local businessmen for the purpose of impressing them with his graduation oratory on the ironic theme of the virtue of humility in achieving progress.  His expectations are upset when he is forced to engage in a physical brawl and brutal coin grab with nine other young men from the community.  Only after this humiliation is he given audience to speak even as they continue to converse over his words.  His intellectual invisibility is further reinforced when he mumbles \\""social equality\\"" only to rescind the sentiment moments later at the unspoken threat of losing the meager opportunity for which he had literally fought.  The exploitation of impoverishment, disorienting inconsistency in the rules of engagement and restriction of voice as a method of curtailing free agency or undesirable ideas display themselves as means of social regulation throughout the novel.<br /><br />Ellison provides a brief glimpse into the adolescent journey of the protagonist before transitioning to his encounter with college life.  This academic experience is punctuated by a confrontation with an administrator who essentially tells him that if he would gain any power for himself in this world, he must learn to render invisible anything in the Black condition which causes discomfort to white financiers.  One is tempted to interpret Bledsoe as a figure in the image of Booker T. Washington.  Through further dialogue we come to understand him as what remains in the shadow of arguably all great men (the obscure legend known only as \\""Founder\\""), a largely sycophantic personality concerned with maintaining centralized power and prestige only to the degree that it serves them personally.  These individuals are neo-colonial power brokers of invisibility curating which areas of Black life will receive notoriety and silencing the voices of those who won't assume the required posture.<br /><br />In addition to this biting critique of Black leadership, the white philanthropist is also subjected to a probing (and telling) inquiry through Ellison's dialogue.  Salvation for Norton defined as charitable giving towards Black edification is exposed to lack any true compassion or yearning for justice otherwise he would not be so shaken to incredulity when confronted by the consequences of southern injustice which exist beyond the campus grounds.  In his conversation with the veteran at the Golden Day, he expresses a notion that the school is tied to his destiny, but is then unable the reconcile the debilitating effect of widespread social oppression.  While the campus can expose Black youth to the limitless possibilities of education and fill their minds with worldly knowledge, it could do nothing to salve their disillusionment from bearing the weight of a social contract which states they may only progress so far before being reminded of their place within society.<br /><br />The longest and most enduring critique in the novel is saved for the white Leftist progressive whom at the time of its writing were largely invested within various branches of Marxism, Communism, Socialism or Trotskyism.  Upon expulsion from school, our protagonist journeys to the urban North in order to seek work.  After realizing that Bledsoe has designated him persona non grata on the campus and that no assistance would be forthcoming from Norton in spite of their alleged linked destinies, he makes an effort to carve out a new life for himself thereby shaping his own identity free of the social pressure towards higher education which haunted him in the South.  Through the subterfuge of a phony recommendation from Emerson, he secures a non-union position at Liberty Paints where he is jostled between identities as an imbecile to Kimbro, a scab to the Union and a provocateur to Brockaway before having his identity stripped in its entirety through post-traumatic amnesia.  Ellison during this period draws invisibility down to a deeply human level exploring the importance of memory and experience in shaping our identity.  Without the conceptual texture of these twin elements, we lack the context in which to understand ourselves as chronological influencers and \\""plunge outside of history\\"" to the narrator's own words proving prophetic in hindsight.  Memory and experience give us the power to reflect upon past occurrences and future test our present actions based upon a newly evolved understanding of cause and effect.  When we discard memory and experience from our navigational toolkit according to the dictates of the Brotherhood, we relinquish some of our capacity to be truly influential and regress to mere interchangeable fragments in the fulfillment of someone else's vision.<br /><br />When Ellison draws the protagonist into relationship with the Brotherhood, we find him at once both lauded for his articulate concern in the interest of his people and chided for couching that concern in the context of race.  This persuasive gambit sets the stage for a split in consciousness where he is urged to exercise his oratorical gift in the service of this community while divorcing himself from the racial alienation which provides the impetus for him rising to action.  The Brotherhood show themselves further engaged in a duplicitous strategy by raising a speaker amongst the Harlem community that can strike the necessary emotional tone with its residents while dismissing the concerns of that community in any future planning.  Such political duplicity is not something confined to the progressive Left of the past when the politics of the Black community were once betrayed by Communist organizations wishing to hold our support amongst the discontented, but taking no interest in addressing the racism embedded in white labor unions leading such brilliant organizers as A. Philip Randolph, Chandler Owen and George Schuyler to abandon their work with the Party.  The political invisibility continues in the present day through the post-racial demand of the Democratic Party establishment and even members of the Black community claiming that it would be unfair for President Obama to show particular favor to this community since he is the President of all America.  At the same time, we are brought to our own split in consciousness for we share a racial identification with President Obama which makes us feel especially smited by attempts to render him and his experiences invisible as occurred during the debate over the birth certificate.  All of the discomforting memories of race which are stirred up between both of those poles is valid and worth accessing in planning our political direction forward.<br /><br />The Brotherhood couches their diminishing of race in a scientific view of history which does not appear to recognize that even the action of having to diminish race is a reaction to its reality and further reinforcement of its power.  Race is a reality that has permeated the relationships and thinking of all members of society such that they are thinking about it even when not doing so explicitly.  Therefore the better hand of history would acknowledge race and racism in order to work through these issues with deep analysis and accountability.  The Invisible Man shines in causing us to reflect on all of these lived experiences and appreciate them as elements which may initially drive us underground in order to escape our discomfort, but can make us better for the journey when we emerge.  As long as the politics of marginalization and resource inequity continue to be a scourge upon society, the politics of invisibility as outlined in this text will continue to be a source of understanding and fictive enlightenment. In spite of the gains made by the Black community since Ellison's time, there is still a marginalization and invisibility occurring urban communities lacking access to fresh produce, medical care and educational opportunity.  The symbols in Ellison's text remain as rich and necessary as ever to sharpen our analysis of the conditions which impede bringing invisible and marginalized populations to vanguard. If we would render ourselves any greater success building bridges over these cultural intersections in the present than was achieved in the past, we would do best to put away the paternalism and seek to build equal partnerships with full transparency.fill their minds with worldly knowledge, it could do nothing to salve their disillusionment from bearing the weight of a social contract which states they may only progress so far before being reminded of their place within society.<br /><br />The longest and most enduring critique in the novel is saved for the white Leftist progressive whom at the time of its writing were largely invested within various branches of Marxism, Communism, Socialism or Trotskyism.

So here are my humble comments on what I did not understand or thought could have been done better.<br /><br />The prologue and a few other spots of the book got so philosophical and esoteric that I gave up trying to understand and moved on after re-reading passages.<br /><br />The story is propelled forward on a series of rather hard to believe coincidences... almost like \\""Alice in Wonderland.\\""  That may have been what the author intended, but that seems to contradict the idea of the author being \\""invisible.\\""<br /><br />Besides this strange string of coincidences, what strikes me about the book is how two dimensional the characters are.  They seem as gray shadows, not as real people one can like or dislike.  Besides the storyteller, there are twenty or so other characters, all but one or two who are barely recognizable as human, since they remain undeveloped and their motives unexplained.  They, ironically, seem to be invisible.<br /><br />So are the unnamed owners of the buildings the rioters burn.. the author seems to look down on them because they require looters to pay rent, as if it is right and just for their property to be destroyed.  The book ends on a downer of chaos, violence, and another Alice in Wonderland - type chapter, and as it began, with a long speech that reminded me why I never liked philosophy.<br /><br />I'll read serious replies, as I do want to understand the book better.  If you reply, please keep it civil.... my review is just what I gleaned... so if I didn't get it, please illuminate for me.",2013-04-30

This is my first time though this book as it is often considered a key text for many students of language and literature entering college, and is often the most cited of the books that come up on the AP exam - all things that should connect to my experience teaching - but it is the wholly subconscious-beat-your-brain-in imagery, symbolism, and situational awareness that exists in this book that makes it a true masterpiece and one of my favorite books I have ever read.  Full disclosure: I do not entirely understand it on a metaphysical level, even though I understand it on a denotative level.  It is its genius that is so remarkable.<br /><br />The thing that is the most striking, and what I hope I am not plagiarizing or regurgitating or even wholly off-track on is its cyclical symbolic nature of history as a whole.  As I read, I almost couldn't help but thinking that the generational symbol of the narrator and his grandfather stood for the allegory of history itself; that the book is, in essence, a stark representation of an American Black Experience as told through allegory from the beginning of the narrator's story to the end, while also representing the experiences of the narrator in the context of his present.  Furthermore, the raw parable seems to also reflect not just Black identity, but male identity.  What it means not only to be Black in America, but also compounded to essentially embody what it means to be living in poverty in America, what it means to be living as a man in America, what it means to be living in an America that seems to have the \\""American Dream\\"" constantly at the tips of your toes as you run toward it while you the rug is torn from under you.<br /><br />It is a truly fascinating book.<br /><br />One thing that I had read in an interview with Ellison was that he considered himself a musician first.  This book certainly also seems to read poem-songlike.  There isn't really a word for it, but the tonal and structural jive of the text itself almost hums with a bebop tenderness and waxing and waning time signature that keeps the audience enthralled with the worlds as they spill onto the page and become a visual-auditory masterpiece.  It reads like the music of the time it was written.<br /><br />In short, I think this book is just as much of a masterpiece as everyone else does, and I plan on reading it again even though I am not convinced that I am 100% certain I have all the facts straight in it.  But, it is absolutely amazing, and I can certainly see the vibe of Americanness that seems to scream from the pages.  While Ellison captures all men in the pages, the visionary brilliance of the text is that it was published in a time when a great deal of my favorite musicians, poets, and artists in the United States were just taking off, and you can smell the subway and cigarettes, hear jazz and car horns, and feel the rough sting of a punch to the gut as you read this - a book a great deal ahead of its time.

I don't think he did anyway. I have read Wells' other works so perhaps he did mean it as some type of allegory, but for what I'm not sure.<br /><br />So only part of my previous review of what I thought was Ellison's book applies. That is: I really enjoyed the plot, and found myself frustrated in certain parts of the book. Particularly with the Invisible Man's anger, and his own culpability in his situation. However my anger turned to understanding and sympathy once his situation was explained in greater depth. But while I found the depiction of anger and madness in the Invisible Man sympathetic, it also made me cringe.<br /><br />Now, here's where things get weird. Since I thought I was reading Ellison, I thought he was making a grand statement about the oppressed and those who oppress. Now I really want to know what Wells was saying about people who are represented by the characters he wrote. Or was just a simple story about the dangers of wanting too much power?

The greatest character in the book, who exemplifies this, is the combination preacher/numbers runner/bookie/etc.  Totally amorphous, everyone mistakes the narrator for him, simply based on his style of dress (sunglasses or not, hat or not, etc.).  This character appears to be an archetype not just of a black American but of anyone who creates a persona or is perceived in various ways by others on the basis of wishful identification.<br /><br />The style is formidable.  Anticipates some of the linguistic technique that later made Kerouac famous.  (Did Kerouac copy from Elllison?  It wouldn't be the first time that a white artist has appropriated from a black artist and ended up with the credit and the sales.  The Beach Boys and Chuck Berry come to mind--&#34;Surfin' USA&#34; is a carbon copy, musically, of &#34;Sweet Little 16.&#34;)<br /><br />The one aspect that seemed a bit out of place is the opening.  The setting described is more like science fiction and seems to have nothing to do with the remainder of the book.  It's as if Ellison wrote it, the novel evolved in a different direction, and he never went through the painful process of reworking the opening.  (Something like this occurs in The World According to Garp; Irving made a great point of describing how the protagonist had a strange look, etc. as a child, then did nothing to connect this with the totally normal adult later in the book.)<br /><br />I wish I'd read this one 40 years ago, but better late than never.",2012-12-15

The idea of feeling invisible rang true to me during a time when I was deeply unsure about my identity.<br /><br />Invisible Man is about the experience of someone who does what various authority figures tell him to do, with the belief it will lead him to various forms of success. From following the path set by the men who run his black southern college - based on the Tuskegee Institute - to following a path set for him by a Communist party dominated by white limousine liberal types, our narrator believes - albeit unconsciously - that what he wants is what other people want of him -- what they want of a black man in general, because they do not really see him. And he is invisible, to them, that is the painful truth. Or at least, he is invisible until he upsets whatever power structure he currently lives under, and you better not believe they like seeing him.<br /><br />When his true self does emerge, in each of these milieus and after much painful realization that he has been trying to fulfill someone else's vision of his destiny, he becomes increasingly unsettled by the role he has played in keeping his race down and keeping himself down.<br /><br />The moral of this book if there is one is probably best expressed by Hamlet's \\""to thine own self be true,\\"" but as Invisible Man and Hamlet both portray it, there is nothing easy about being true to one's own self, especially as a member of a group that has been kept down for hundreds of years, that has been told by the power structure how to act. He has lived his whole life thinking more about what others want of him than what he wants.

He endures road blocks through the story that expresses the challenges that any youth has to face when growing up despite whatever color your skin is; you can either be a leader (an individual that follows their own heart and thoughts) or be a sheep and follow what everyone else says and do. This book is much more than just showing readers the side of racism, it also about seeking the desired American Dream (who to me is nothing but smoke and mirrors) and also having an identity in a self-contradicting world where everyone hide daggers in their smiles.",2012-10-19

When he studied at the college, Dr. Bledsoe showcased him to the trustee as a model of the school's success. In turn, the trustee funded the school to heel his wounded heart.

I had read it previously about 25 years ago and I was astonished at how little I remembered from the previous reading. I knew I liked it a lot but I recalled very few details from the previous reading so it was as though I was reading it for the first time.<br /><br />Reinforced by the fact that Ellison himself cites the influence in his forward to the 30th anniversary edition, I was struck by this novel as an African-American Notes from the Underground.  The invisible man is more sympathetic and less abrasive than the Underground Man and one can sympathize with him as he explains what led him from his earlier naïve and idealistic state to his current detached but not quite misanthropic view of humanity. The entire novel has a nightmarish quality and recalls the paranoia of Kafka with its characters full of suspicion that are almost completely lacking in compassion.<br /><br />The novel is even more impressive considering when it was written, in the late 40's and early 50's, a time of very rigidly enforced segregation. While it is obviously about racial attitudes and identity, I often was not aware of the race of certain characters, even though the `Brotherhood' that the narrator joins and for which he becomes an accidental spokesman is essentially a Communist organization manipulated and dominated by white liberals. The narrator's issues of identity transcend race. His adventures flow into one another by happenstance and he is labeled and mislabeled consistently by black as well as white characters. He has sexual encounters with white women which, while not shocking in the 21st century, must have been quite disturbing to many readers in the early 50's. He stands up to the white subjugators as much as to other blacks, many of whom have their own expectations of the roles he should play.<br /><br />Much of the novel is quite riveting and swept this reader along a wave of passion and righteous indignation. However, much of it did not feel realistic to me, nor was it intended to be. It possesses the logic of a dream. Aside from the narrator, the only person that is not selfish, mean-spirited, oblivious or petty is the elderly black woman Mary Rambo, who is virtually saintlike. Aside from the machinations of the plot which are sometimes implausible, the novel holds up sixty plus years later because the spiritual journey the narrator undergoes leads him beyond his identity as an African American. He strips away all of the labels that have been pinned on him until all he is left with is his own mind. His underground state is necessary although he acknowledges that, like all hibernations, it must come to an end.

Even though Ellison always claimed that the Invisible Man was based off of Dostoevsky's narrator from Notes From Underground, There are times when the IM sounds more like Milton's Lucifer.<br /><br />Overall, this novel is a powerful and moving classic that combines poetry, great literature, black culture and humanity in a single volume, which holds one in its grip long after the last page is turned.",2012-06-14

Anyone who's experienced disillusionment with the things other people uphold (and which you've always believed in and tried to uphold yourself)--anyone who's felt an irreconcilable break between reality as upheld by oneself and society, as upheld by one group and by another, as experienced by oneself and described by others--should be able to empathize with the Invisible Man.

I chose to read this book because of its great use of theme to create a central story into what the author wanted out of its readers. Ellison uses experiences in which he faced to create a visual interpretation into, what his feelings of finding a identity in American society at this time created for him. This book overall gave me a good read, and allowed me to find a central theme in which the author wanted its readers to find.<br /><br />Invisible Man is told through a young African American, who feels that he is Invisible to society simply because other people refuse to acknowledge him; and society's misfits through his \\""invisibility\\"". The first theme that I identified through use of context was his independence from American society, and his ability to fend for himself. Ellison explains that independence through this quote \\""That I am nobody but myself. But first I had to discover that I am an Invisible Man\\"" (15). The narrator's realization that society has turned its back on him because of his skin color, allows him to gain that independence in which he seeks. This theme allows the reader to visualize the narrator's feelings towards society, and his grasp of independence throughout the book. The second theme which was identified was racism interfering with individual identity. In the book he is quoted as saying \\""I yam what I am\\"" (263). His feeling of his background shows the interference with racism and it getting in the way with his identity search. Ellison uses this stereotype as a way to show its effecting way on identity of the narrator. By creating this theme throughout the book, Ellison was able to give the reader a simple dose of being a young black male at this time. Ellison used words that also gave the reader a good visual, allowing them to grasp theme throughout his book. He used the word complexion to show his realization of the different races that he must face in American society. The context is as quoted \\""forgiving and fighting his enemies of both complexions\\"". Ellison chose to use this term to create a visual to the reader of the two races that he's associated with, and what he must go through to find his identity in this society. The reviews that I read criticized Ellison's approach to attacking this kind of subject. In my opinion Ellison simply created a story in a way of experience, to show other readers his feelings on certain types of subjects that he views as critical in American society. Some text evidence to support that is \\""he who had rallied the ignorant, the fearful and suspicious, those still trapped in the rags of slavery\\"" (129).

I found myself (as I did 20 years ago and in the 1970s when I first read it) stopping frequently to reflect, to retrace my thoughts, and to think hard about all the things this book is about.<br /><br />In short, this is a serious novel for serious readers.<br /><br />While clearly this is a novel about race and identity, it transcends those two very common themes in American literature.  It challenges both the racial politics prevailing in the American South and the liberal politics (and Marxist politics) of the supposedly more enlightened North, exposing both to be merely implements of people (both black and white) who use them for personal power and gain.<br /><br />Among the many things I love about this novel is that it challenges the usual pattern of the Bildungsroman, the growth of the central character into some kind of disillusioned authenticity.  The last chapter of Invisible Man, along with the epilogue, suggest that such a state of autonomy is a goal that always remains elusively ahead of us, receding into the distance as we try to close on it.  And so the novel interrogates both the idea of racial identity and the Emersonian ideal of individuality (the two are often counterpoised in discussion of affirmative action, for instance, and the novel reveals how complicated and tangled both ideas are in practice).<br /><br />Ellison's prose can at times be difficult, but it is worth careful attention.  Its rhythms are beautiful and at times hypnotizing, and his play with words and with myth -- arguably this is a rewritten Odyssey -- is always thought provoking.  Moreover, while incorporating a number of character types -- Norton, Bledsoe, Emerson, Jack, Mary, Ras, and even Rinehart all represents kinds of people I know of -- each comes across as an idiosyncratic individual, each neatly developed through revealing specifics.  This novel is obviously the product of both genius and master craftsmanship.<br /><br />The Vintage edition is very good -- for one thing, it includes the prologue and epilogue (I've learned that some editions, sadly, omit them).  The quality of the paper and the binding hold up well; it's important to me that a book feel right in my hands and this one feels great.<br /><br />I'm surprised that neither the Library of America nor the Norton Critical Editions have produced editions of this work.

Although interracial relations have improved by leaps and bounds and the President is black it will take hundreds of years to achieve harmony to the point where, for example, interracial marriage can be accepted as natural rather than an aberration. Although fiction, Ellison's book can serve to put into historical context for the modern reader the great racial divide that existed not so long ago. It also explores the infighting and conflicting powerplays, jealousies and rivalries among the blacks. For many the road to power and success involved demeaning condescension to white authority which meant that that power or success could be rescinded if deference for and to the white man was deemed to be inadequate.<br /><br />The story follows an unnamed black man from his student days at a Negro College in the South to his working life in New York City and recruitment by the Brotherhood, a political organization run by whites purporting to befriend the black community and work for racial equality. We follow him on his quest to achieve respectable and successful personhood by accepting the dictates and discipline of leaders who use him as a means to achieve their own objectives with little or no regard for his rights, his intelligence or his feelings. His trust in other people goes unrewarded. As he is repeatedly deceived, he is often backed into corners where he is boxing unknown shadows as well as flesh-and-blood adversaries. He is frequently intellectually manipulated and swindled. I felt almost hypnotically compelled and emotionally committed to follow his struggles--which is something that distinguishes significant writing skill by an author. I admit that the character's ubiquitous self-directed monologues and incoherent hallucinations can test a reader's patience but when they occur they provide intervals for reflecting on the mental turmoil in the narrator's life. At the end I regretted that in his journey he didn't achieve one deep and meaningful relationship with another human being, although he came close with Carson, his compatriot in the Brotherhood, and with Mary, his landlady. He describes a lonely life of turmoil but he has an inner strength which supports him to pick up the pieces and move on. Staunch, but innocently naïve, determination characterizes his story.<br /><br />In the book's Epilogue he attempts to sum up and make sense out of the chaos. As he leaves behind his previous high ideals, based on harmony, equality, discipline, trust and cooperation, he is left with a somewhat dissipated and divisive realization of life as he states: \\""I'm invisible, not blind. No, indeed, the world is just as concrete, ornery, vile and sublimely wonderful as before, only now I better understand my relation to it and it to me.

Of course we were immediately chastised by the school, even having the principal call our house and tell us that she was sorry that my son was not mature enough to handle this book, and how maybe someday he will be.

Written in the first person, the nameless main character tells his life, from his freed-slaves grandparents, and his fight to overcome the curse his grandfather throws in his deathbed, about the irremediably eternal condition of inferiority of the Afro Americans. The central character, decided to make it in life, has to overcome horrible humiliations, pictured remarkably, for example, in the hair-rising scene where he has to fight, blindfolded, against other black guys, to the abject pleasure of the \\""good society\\"". Finally he is admitted in a college exclusively for Afro Americans, where he suceeds until an accidental affair brings that time to an end. This other whole affair, although simple bad luck, also reflects the injustice embedded in racism.<br /><br />He then goes to New York, where no door opens for him, until he gets involved with a \\""progressive\\"" group called \\""The Brotherhood\\"". This is a  multirracial group supposedly dedicated to fight against discrimination, but it may have another, secret, politcal agenda. Our man causes an immediate impact as speaker, agitator, and organizer, which brings in women, friends, and also enemies and envy.<br /><br />The magic of this novel is that it never surrenders to the temptations of victimism and self-pity. On the contrary, it mantains a sense of humor and a fierce mordacity, depicting the character as a truly free man in every sense of the word, a rebel with a cause who never succumbs to corruption and group-thinking. And clearly the story told is not exclusive to racial problems. Envy, spitefulness, betrayal, abound in humanity.<br /><br />Better than I had hoped, it seems to me to be a novel of universal reach and literary greatness.",2011-07-19

I read the blurbs and, although I saw that Saul Bellow had praised it, I found the promise of Invisible Man intriguing nonetheless.  The idea of describing the pre-civil rights era black man as being invisible in plain sight appealed to me as an insightful take on human nature.  I looked forward to reading this novel as a unique perspective.  I was eager to understand the first person perspective of a man who inhabits his world, invisible to everyone who sees him despite his best efforts to be seen.  I expected too much.  The idea of the story I thought, and still think is wonderful.  The execution is a bit less wonderful.<br /><br />Mr. Ellison is, quite frankly not a very intriguing writer.  He has a tin-ear for dialogue and his people are not recognizably human.  His characters, with the possible exception of the white subversives do not speak an authentic vocabulary and his attempts at writing accents are like a tone-deaf man relating a melody.<br /><br />Like his dialogue, his characters do not ring true.  I am left with the impression that Mr. Ellison never actually met, much less understood any of the regular, work-a-day people he tries to populate his story with.  Ordinary people are as invisible to him as he believes his character to feel.  His character, on the other hand is not so much invisible as he is transparent.  I found myself early on with the impression of an unintelligent liar, telling me poor lies and expecting me to believe them because he has already fooled himself into believing them.  That impression was confirmed again and again with each subsequent tale.  Several times I actually called the book a liar out loud (in manners of speech), putting it down in disgust.  The more I read, the more I felt burdened as I have in my life when forced to listen to similarly poor liars, telling me stupid fantasies in an attempt to either impress me or to avoid punishment.  Perhaps Mr. Ellison was too clever for me and has actually written a tale told by a dense, pathological liar, to see whether his audience would figure it out.<br /><br />The writing mechanics of the novel are poor as well.  Mr. Ellison has no flair for description and his prose is uninteresting.  I am confused as to why anyone would have thought this worthy of publication or promotion.  I forced myself to read the entire novel because I made a promise to do so.  I certainly regret having made that promise.  It is said, the proof of the pudding is in the eating.

But, as the `narrator' of Ellison's novel learned to his sorrow, Obama is none too clearly `visible' to his supporters either. The most clear-sighted examination of Obama's personhood and politics that I've read is historian James Kloppenberg's \\""Reading Obama: Dreams, Hope, and the American Tradition.\\"" Using both biographical material and Obama's own writings, from his earliest articles in the Harvard Law Journal through his own full-length books to his campaing speeches and presidential addresses, Professor Kloppenberg convincingly locates Obama in the tradition of American pragmatism and of consensus achieved by dialogue, a thinker not attracted to ideology of either the left or the right, a socially liberal moderate whose ideas reflect his education in American history and philosophy. The strongest influences on Obama's thinking come, according to Kloppenberg, from philospher John Rawls, hsitorian Gordon Wood, theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, and legal scholar Lawrence Tribe. As a result, Obama's political stances are remarkably close to what the German philosopher J&uuml;rgen Habermas would approve, above all a commitment to democratic discourse and a discomfort with any sort of absolutism or `foundationalism.'<br /><br />However, Kloppenberg also traces the special influence of Obama's experience as a `man of color' in American society, and examines the impact that African-American writers and leaders have had on the country's first non-white president. In particular, Kloppenberg suggests that Obama's early encounter with the novel \\""Invisible Man\\"" has made a lasting impression:<br />\\""\\""Obama's debts to Ellison run particularly deep. Many borrowed images from Invisible Man ... pop up in passages in Dreams From My Father. Yet Obama acknowledges that no matter how attractive the pose of anger and alienation seemed to him as a young man, it was a poor fit, both because of his even-tempered personality and because of his very different circumstances. For all these reasons Invisible Man, with its deperate refusal to surrender, its determination to affirm the principle [of equality in diversity, of `e pluribus unum], and its resolutely indeterminate ending, left a particularly clear imprint on Obama's sensibility.\\""\\""<br /><br />\\""Very different circumstances\\"" indeed!  Invisible Man was published in 1952! Before the Supreme Court decisions that struck down `separate but equal' apartheid in the USA. Before MLK and Malcolm X, before the civil rights campaigns of the `50s and 60s but also before Black Power and the Black Panthers. Before the elections of the first Black governors, mayors, and congresspeople since the aborted Reconstruction after the War to Extend Slavery. Before an African-American without an Uncle Remus drawl could speak up without causing consternation. Before a TV ad could possibly have shown a sophisticated, personable African-American socializing with a similar European-American.

I had to reappraise it, in light of all those incomplete transformations of American society, in light of the election of Obama and the frenzied backlash it has generated.<br /><br />And I could write a book about this book. In fact, many books have already been written about this book. It's a challenging, complex piece of literature. It probably defies any coherent exegesis; I know I wouldn't try.

It's a sprawling story, many chapters of which are obviously not intended to be flatly realistic.

A one-page outline of the plot of Invisible Man would be also parallel to that of Lazarillo de Tormes, the 16th C Spanish novel often considered the first picaresque. In other words, Invisible Man can't be and shouldn't be read just as an African-American book; it belongs in the canon of European literature, written in a European language - English - to be comprehended in the context of European socio-political traditions. To deny Ralph Ellison's European intellectual roots, entwined with his historical American identity as the grandchild of slaves, is to perpetuate the \\""invisibility\\"" his fictional character suffers.

Every 10 days or so,  a large box of books would arrive for troops \\""in the field\\""; mainly the books were westerners, mysteries, pulp fictions, but bless whoever packed the box, because they always included a few worthwhile one, and one day, down at the bottom of the box, lay Ellison's classic book.<br /><br />How far we have come now, since the times depicted; and yes, how far we still have to go. I've been re-reading the triumvirate of Black, or Afro-American writers if you will, best known for there searing accounts of the injustices that were still being perpetrated, as a legacy of America's \\""original sin,\\"" slavery, during the days of segregation, legal and de facto. There is Richard Wright, James Baldwin and Ralph Ellison, and I'd welcome reader comments if others should be included.<br /><br />I normally mark the books I read, for memorable passages; concise and pithy formulations; or just beautiful prose. On this re-read, I noticed a mark I made 42 years ago, at the beginning of a paragraph. But there was no corresponding closure mark...until 16 pages later! It was the first time I had ever mark a passage that long - the entire first chapter. Re-reading it again I felt the same awful, horrible unease that I did the first time - that people nominally like me, white men, could do... no, far more than do, derive pleasure from the actions described towards black men and a white woman. It remains a brilliant depiction of the awful corrupting influence of power.<br /><br />The next chapters are equally disconcerting. The unnamed narrator - invisible, you understand - goes off to a Black college (a thinly disguised Tuskegee Institute?) intent on \\""succeeding.\\"" He plays \\""the game\\"" to his utmost ability, but \\""fate\\"" has a different outcome in mind, as he is assigned as the driver to one of the rich, white, Northern trustees. The trustees periodically come South, in part, to feel good about their efforts in funding this educational institution for Blacks. The narrator inadvertently shows the trustee the `underbelly' of Black Southern life. The trustee is profoundly disturbed. Bledsoe, who is the ingratiating, hat-in-hand, President of the college tells the narrator that it was his duty to lie to the Whites, and tell them what they want to hear. The narrator is expelled from college, and is later betrayed by Bledsoe.<br /><br />There is a prescient observation at the beginning of the chapters involving college life, and it concerns a bronze statue at the front, with a Founding Father figure apparently lifting a veil from the eyes of a slave: \\""...and I am standing puzzled, unable to decide whether the veil is really being lifted, or lowered more firmly in place.\\"" With the emphasis on football, and the coach's salary, so many years later, this observation may well be true of all colleges.<br /><br />Like so many other Blacks before him, the narrator seeks solace in the North, fleeing to Harlem. He has a stint trying to work in a paint plant, but it is ultimately his visceral oration which occurred when he witnessed the eviction of an elderly Black couple that led him to \\""The Brotherhood,\\"" (a thinly disguised Communist Party?), and his new career as a community organizer (hum, speaking of invisible no longer).<br /><br />Ellison presents a wide-range of insights into New York, society, and the human condition. One scene describes the simple, almost Proustian pleasures that can be derived from smelling and eating yams on the street. From that he renders now time-honored insights into the Party or as he calls it, the Brotherhood; the endless machinations of those who desire and exercise power on behalf of that wonderful abstraction: \\""the People.\\"" There are two separate sections that address that ancient `taboo', miscegenation; the mutual attractions and dynamics of a white woman - black man relationship way back when it was considered \\""radical.\\"" Ellison also manages to portray the \\""street-hustlers,\\"" in the personification of Reinhart, who is a numbers man, a pimp, and, of course, a preacher too. The climatic portion of the book dealt with the murder of Clifton, as topical as last week's trial in Oakland, whereby a white policeman guns down an unarmed Black man. There was so much anguish in that scene, since Clifton had once been one of the most influential Brotherhood workers on behalf of their youth movement, but had suddenly left, only to be found by the narrator, selling dolls that ridiculed his race.<br /><br />Numerous quotes are worthwhile, and they may serve as antecedents for similar sentiments in other books, or, they may be derivatives also.

I had avoided it until now as I had a difficult time imagining that I'd enjoy it.  It overwhelmed me.  This is especially true since was written in the late 40s and early 50s.<br /><br />The book is about an unnamed African American man from the southern U.S. who is intelligent and seeks to be a role model and exemplary representative of his race.  In the 40s and 50s, the concept of representing your race was an expectation as racism was more explicit.<br /><br />The novel contains many, many extremely vivid scenes.  The power really begins with the famous Battle Royal scene.  It needs to be read to be fully appreciated.  This is where the jarring, hard hitting novel really takes off.<br /><br />This is followed by an extremely confused scene at a bar called The Golden Day which is chaotic, confusing and exciting.<br /><br />These two scenes set the stage for many more memorable events that I won't go into but that are equally intense.  Race riots, the Paint Factory scene, interracial sex experiences (very controversial for the time), the conflict between the socialist Brotherhood and the more radical black leaders.  This book is packed with wonderfully written, unforgettable scenes about a man's struggle in America.<br /><br />Clearly, from other reviews, this is not everyone's cup of tea but I am surprised several people found this such a chore to get through.  I honestly found it to be a page turner and read it very quickly.<br /><br />I've focused on the intensity of the novel which is a key aspect.  This shouldn't take away from the exploration of many underlying themes of racism in America in the 50s that still ring true today.<br /><br />I think this is a major work and very highly recommend it.",2010-03-15
US,50002830,R25SN2X3M7OI9Q,0679732764,691093854,Invisible Man,Books,5,4,5,N,N,"A Brilliant, Dark, Complex, and Ambiguous Masterpiece","Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man is many things, all of them great:  one of the twentieth century's best novels, a landmark identity exploration, one of the most brilliantly vivid dramatizations of existentialism and other Post-Modern intellectual concerns, one of the most relevant sociopolitical works since World War II, a revolutionary novel in structural terms that proved highly influential, and a milestone of African American art. It is essential for anyone even remotely interested in such things and, indeed, anyone even slightly concerned with twentieth century literature.<br /><br />Invisible is often called a \\""black novel,\\"" and while this sells it incredibly short, it has much to admire in this regard. The protagonist and most major characters are black, and the book gives a fascinating peak at mid-century African American culture, especially black intellectuals, political dissidents, early black power movements, and urban blacks.  We get a good idea of such movements' ins and outs as well as their members' thoughts, speech, and behavior. The novel memorably deals with many themes of great importance to African Americans, from poverty to racism to identity issues. It is also steeped in black history. However, it is important to realize that Ellison did not set out to write a \\""black novel\\"" in the sense of Richard Wright or James Baldwin. He was in fact disturbed by those pressing such strict sociopolitical readings, stressing that he wished Invisible could be seen \\""simply as a novel.\\"" To be sure, it has much to say about African Americans and their status then and now and is at least as political in its way as anything overtly meant as such. However, it is extremely complex and ambiguous; critics and readers still debate just what Ellison meant more than half a century later. This was clearly intentional; nearly every aspect of the book has great sociopolitical relevance, but it never even comes close to didactic. Ellison dramatizes supremely meaningful themes and raises many profound questions but knows better than to give answers; that is up to us. As with Zora Neale Hurston, his refusal to take a definite stand on \\""black\\"" issues did not sit well with the more forceful politically engaged black leaders, but this is to the book's literary benefit. Released in 1952, it is an important link between Modernism and Post-Modernism; its relentless staging of profound philosophical issues with an existential awareness of the impossibility of definitive answers is distinctly Modern, while its political aspect is very Post-Modern. It walks a similar line between African American literature and general literature with the former's trappings and the latter's breadth. The bottomline is that it has the strengths of both and is great on both fronts.<br /><br />Important as Invisible is to black concerns, it is also grandly universal - politically, philosophically, and otherwise. Above all, it is an eloquent illustration of the underdog in all facets - an extremely vivid account of what it is like to be an outcast in various societies. The Invisible Man symbolizes everyone who is downtrodden, whether from race, class, beliefs, or whatever else. It is thus a supremely searching and stirringly affecting portrait of modern alienation; whether in the rural South or Harlem, the Invisible Man is essentially down and out and in the most fundamental sense alone. There is a strong criminal, even revolutionary, element to his plight that shines a much-needed light on the vast dark side of a mid-century era that many think of as idyllic. A far cry from the official Leave It to Beaver world, it was a loud wake-up call to a complacent society and remains a vibrantly relevant paean to outcasts everywhere.<br /><br />Many Post-Modern themes abound - paranoia, distrust of authority, etc. -, but identity crisis is preeminent. One of the most truly existential novels, Invisible focuses largely on the prime existential question - how to find oneself in a world where traditional authority, from government to religion, has become extinct. One can no longer rely on higher sources but must find the answer in one's own heart and mind. Invisible is thus a bildungsroman on top of everything else - one's man's struggle to find the answer. Traditional fallbacks fail one after another, and he is left truly alone but not without a certain dignity and even a certain (very unconventional) strength. His fight for true independence has some success, and the self-awareness and clear-sightedness he gains is in many ways at least as valuable as the illusions he loses. Probably no one would want to be him, but all honest thinking people can see themselves in him - a disturbing thought reinforced in the unforgettable closing words. We certainly do not envy him, mainly because we can see ourselves becoming him so easily; he is an extreme version of the darkness that can befall an intelligent, capable person unable to fit into modern society. We identify with the darkness at his heart because we see it in ours - hopefully barely kindled but in danger of becoming a conflagration at any moment, just as his unexpectedly does when he seems on the very brink of success.<br /><br />Important as the content is, the structure is also integral. The back of the book claims that Invisible gives \\""an entirely new model of what a novel can be,\\"" which is not much of an exaggeration. Non-linear and distinctly anti-realist with a highly symbolic, often surreal plot, it again straddles Modernism and Post-Modernism. This is one of the main reasons that calling it a \\""black novel\\"" is severely limiting. For one thing, it is highly allusive, referring to many works by non-blacks; Homer's Odyssey is an important source, and Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground and H. G. Wells' Invisible Man are essential antecedents acknowledged by Ellison. Though not near-impenetrable as the likes of Joyce, Faulkner, and Pynchon are at their most abstruse, Invisible is challenging; the content was audacious and is still provocative, and the protagonist is not the usual sympathetic one, but the structure itself is demanding. One can read - and even enjoy - Invisible on a surface level, but those willing to dig deeper and truly engage themselves will get so much more out of it. We must make an effort to identify with the protagonist even when he seems most alien precisely because this is when he is really most familiar, and we must be alive to the frequent symbolism. Those willing to do so will be well rewarded; few novels are broader in scope or more complex in execution, not to mention more thematically meaningful and relevant. Invisible is a masterpiece on every level, making the fact that Ellison never finished a second novel a truly tragic loss to literature; it thankfully stands alone as a towering monument that will make him a literary immortal.

He makes himself invisible so he doesn't have to deal with the hate and the discrimination of the world.

I have to say that I kind of got what was meant by him being Invisible as he says he is in the novels beginning.  No one really listens to him all throughout this thing.  Toward the end it becomes almost laughable as he impersonates another person, compeletely fooling everyone.  There is alot of racism in this novel and this may seem a strange-sounding review.  The book is well-written but it feels like a series of seperate events that are only connected by the common narrator.  There isn't much of an interesting story.  Once he gets North, he joins some kind of Communist group for what reason I don't recall.  And none of this is really interesting.  I guess the message of Invisibility is what counts here as they mainly use him a token black guy and don't really see him as a true person at all.  There is one semi-cool character named Ras the Exhorter who is against the Communists and wants all blacks against all whites.  He later becomes Ras the Destroyer and goes out to war in the novels exciting race-riot scenes.  But you have to go through hundreds of pages to get to that.  I felt that Ellison ripped off some things from Richard Wright's Black Boy novel.  For instance, he joins a Communist group just as Wright did.  There are other things that happen but I don't feel like going into everything now.  Basically, the narrator's life here imitates Richard Wrights in alot of ways I feel.

The more the invisible man is used by others, the more invisible he becomes and the less self-identity he possesses.  He allows himself, unwittingly, to be used by others, both black and white, for their own purposes.  He gains nothing from dealing with these characters and actually loses more and more of his self-worth, thus creating his invisibility as a person.  It is only when he begins to realize that he must define his own self-worth and not allow others to dictate to him or define his identity that his \\""invisibility\\"" begins to diminish.  The idea that \\""white is right, white has might\\"", symbolized by the paint factory, was the ideology of those times.  Segregation was practiced and blacks were looked down upon as ignorant, nameless members of the American culture.  They were invisible citizens in a white-dominated culture.  The author wanted to send the message to readers that America was founded upon the philosophy of individual freedom in all areas and that nothing was gained by forcing people to conform to society's standards.  By conforming, individual identity is lost and invisibility as a person increases.  \\""I am not invisible that nobody can see me.

Jim Trueblood has 'accidentally' impregnated his own daughter, and this lurid incident has become a source of shame for the black community and a source of celebration for the prejudiced white community.<br /><br />In contrast, Mr. Norton's reaction to this story seems intensely suspicious, and the writing may suggest that something similar has happened in his own past. And yet, it becomes immediately obvious that the same crime could be so much more easily covered up when the perpetrator possesses a respected skin tone and possesses significant financial resources. A rich white man may be able to cover up what a poor black man cannot; a rich white woman may choose to keep silent in order to preserve the social standing that a poor black woman cannot dream of; a rich white daughter may be sent off to a \\""private school\\"" for a secret abortion that a poor black girl could never afford.<br /><br />It is the power of \\""Invisible Man\\"" that these issues are never answered and are not in fact even \\""explicitly\\"" raised.

It is a story told by a black man coming of age in the mid-1940s, and thus is about black anonymity in a white world. But one of the primary strengths of the novel is that its \\""meta-messages\\"" are all about anonymity and thus makes it universal and applicable equally to any race and even to any urban culture.<br /><br />It is existential in the sense that it is as much about cultural alienation in a modern world as it is about how to confront the barbaric social rules of a racist American culture. However, race is only one of the many themes in a subtext rich and textured with many sub-themes.  Fear, distrust, betrayal, treachery, coming of age, and being invisible in plan sight, are just some of the other themes that run on parallel tracks in the subtext.<br /><br />The story itself is a rather complex, if not altogether tortuous and improbable plot, betraying an otherwise cleanly written and logical structure. It seems to have been \\""jerry-rigged\\"" to assist in the convergence of, and the resolution of, the many disparate threads and themes. That he pulled them all together in the end is itself no small technical feat, and probably accounts for the books inordinate length.<br /><br />The author speaks in the (invisible) voice of the first person, leaving as few emotional clues as possible -- under the set of literary and emotional rules that he operates under and exploits. Other reviewers have compared his use of these devices to those used by Dostoyevski in his \\""Notes From the Underground,\\"" which is one of my favorite novels, and although I cannot disagree with these reviewers interpretations, I prefer to compare them with those used in Kafka's \\""The Trial.\\"" I believe the tensions created, and the way the novel is finally resolved, as well as the way he exploits the idea of being constantly controlled by larger forces, are equally palpable in both novels.<br /><br />As for the issue of race, the highest marks must be given to Ellison both for his craft and for his artistic temperament, for not succumbing to a direct attack on American racism, using instead an oblique attack. Not that a direct attack was not a requirement of the times, but that it would have been viewed as being too angry, or too bitter.

I don't entirely agree with this take on the book - at least not for the book as a whole.  Some reviewers group this book in with a genre of \\""African American Literature\\"".  Sure, one can conclude this because the protagonist is black, but I think it belongs in the realm of \\""classic literature\\"" without the African-American qualifier.  I think so because though the protagonist is black, not all his experiences are uniquely experiences of a man as a black man but rather as a man dealing with other people regardless of his and their race.<br /><br />The book starts out as some of the other reviewers have stated.  The narrator does ponder what his role as a black man is in a \\""white\\"" world, but really this happens primarily when he is in college and in his first few months in New York.  He feels invisible because he feels people only see him as a black man and not as a man period (his humanity is unseen).  The narrator feels others, both black and white, have defined who he is and who he should be based on the factor of race alone.<br /><br />After his experience with the Brotherhood, however, you realize his central driving concern has transformed from: \\""Why do people (black and white) try to box me into their definition of what it means to be a black man?\\"" to \\""Why don't they see me as an individual with my own value based not on their preconceived notions of who I am but by the quality of my own beliefs, my own intellect, and my own actions?\\"".<br /><br />The narrator joins the Brotherhood (a Communist group that has both black and white members) because that group, he believes, does not define him as a black man but as a \\""man\\"".  It turns out to be true that the Brotherhood, as a group, does not see him as a black man per se, but they know that others (in Harlem) do, and so he discovers that to the Brotherhood he is a tool to advance their communist agenda in Harlem (they pick him because they know no black person in Harlem would ever buy anything a white man has to say about \\""progress\\"").  To the Brotherhood, the narrator does not have an identity as an individual but rather is a cog in a machine.  So where he is invisible to people outside the Brotherhood who only see him as a black man, his individuality disappears altogether inside the Brotherhood and so becomes invisible to them as well.<br /><br />The reason the book is not about a black man's struggle against the white man is that there is a character in the book whose central role is just this and our narrator gets in two vicious battles with this man.  The man is Ras the Exhorter/Ras the Destroyer.  His is a world of white oppression against the black man.  This man thinks that black men in the Brotherhood have sold out to their white oppressor.  The narrator, as evidenced by the battles, disagrees.<br /><br />I think the most pointed evidence of the narrator's search for human identity (not necessarily black identity) is when he delivers his first speech as a member of the Brotherhood.  At this point, he misunderstands the underlying purpose of the Brotherhood and delivers a speech that meets with considerable disfavor from the Brotherhood members.  They don't like his speech because in it the narrator says, rather evocatively, \\""... I feel, I feel suddenly that I have become more human...\\""  Here the narrator expresses the affirmation of his individual humanity, not black, not white, not as part of a group, but as a man that is defined by what he believes.  Why not black identity?  Because throughout the book he gets into battles not just with Ras the Exhorter (who is black); but with Bledsoe from the college (who is black); and with Lucius Brockway from the paint factory (who is black) and with the black members of the Brotherhood.  His battles with these other black men are not just physical or verbal; they are symbolic, as each of these men conceives his identity as that inextricably tied to his race.  To Ras, the right black is to be just black; to Bledsoe, the right black is the conjured, helpless black; to Lucius Brockway the right black is the white man's black; and, to the black members of the Brotherhood, the right black is not to be black at all but to be \\""gray\\"".  The narrator wants his own definition of himself made by himself for himself.<br /><br />There's so much more to this book than what I describe above.

As a classic, much has been made of its importance as a study of racial identity in the 1930s. The narrator is a young black man. He is expelled from a southern university in the beginning of the novel when he is assigned the task of chauffeuring a visiting benefactor, a white man, to a school function. The benefactor asks to go for a drive, and the narrator gives him a tour of the rural south that is a little too scenic, one might say.<br /><br />Thus expelled, the narrator heads to Harlem to seek work and a real-life education. There he becomes a member of The Brotherhood, a mixed-race organization that seems progressive at first. But as the narrator discovers time and again, it's more hype than enthusiasm to actually change the status quo. And despite the repeated offering of help from others, the narrator can only depend on himself. Because, as he realizes, to them he exists only in terms of his ability to help them and forward their cause. To them he is not a person. To them he is an invisible man.<br /><br />THE INVISIBLE MAN is a book about the politics of racial identity, but framed in the context of the greater philosophical question of identity itself. The narrator, who conspicuously is never named, encounters time and time again the paradoxes of identity. Perceptions, deception, propaganda. The way an action can change a person's image in a community forever. The way a group can push for social change in principle but fail to back that in action (reality).

We watch Ellison's hero evolve, as he learns that participation in white American society doesn't mean that he needs to deny his racial background and folk (read: democratic) traditions The result is an altogether new work, whose comic, satiric, tragic, and even bitter tone describes a world in which up is down and the North is like the South.<br /><br />The uniqueness of Ellison's work is multiplied by unreal (and seemingly unrealistic) situations.

But to say such things is to diminish this book, to suggest that, though it is a well-crafted and powerful piece of social satire, it is somehow still not on the same plane as books by great white (or should I say European-American?) authors like Faulkner and Hemingway.<br /><br />Perhaps the best author with whom to compare Ellison is Franz Kafka. The journey of Ellison's unnamed narrator/protagonist from rural South to urban North, from a land of overt racism to one of more covert prejudice, is fraught not only with peril but with comic misadventure; its existential angst echoes \\""The Trial\\"" and Josef K.'s odyssey through the terrifying but darkly comedic layers of of an inscrutable bureacracy that seeks, for no apparent reason, to do him harm. (The word \\""protagonist\\"" scarcely applies to either character; both men are corks borne upon the sea, conscious of, and understanding of, but unable to control, their fates.)<br /><br />But Ellison's book isn't simply \\""The Trial\\"" with a change of venue. No, it is a far more realistic and convincing story, told with greater detail and sharper observations. In the early pages of the book, Ellison's narrator describes in chilling detail a \\""battle royal\\"" down South, an event in which black men were blindfolded, put in a boxing ring, and forced to flail widly at each other until there was only one man standing, all for the amusement of a watching crowd of whites. Like all great art, the chapter leaves an indelible impression on one's mind, hitting not with the glancing blow of a sightless pawn, but with the sharp-eyed accuracy of a champion's right cross.<br /><br />Importantly, Ellison pulls no punches when depicting Southern black culture in subsequent chapters. Had he framed the book in simple us/them, black/white, good/bad dichotomies, he might have written a good racial polemic, but it would not have been great literature. Instead Ellison and his narrator dare to show the seedy underbelly of rural black life; tasked with escorting a visiting white university trustee, his narrator takes the man off the idyllic campus, first to a shack where a black sharecropper farmer has impregnated his own daughter, and then to a bordello. This infuriates the school's president, who tells the narrator that \\""the only way to please a white man is to tell him a lie!\\"" As an exposition of the character of the school president, this line is great; as social satire, it is even better, a double-barrel shotgun blast devasatating both to those whites who want to hear only lies and to those blacks who want to tell them. But Ellison, in contrast to many of his characters, seeks and tells truths.<br /><br />Perhaps the book's greatest strength is its descriptions of urban America. Upon arriving in Harlem, the narrator encounters \\""college boys working to return to school down South; older advocates of racial progress with utopian schemes for building black business empires; preachers ordained by no authority except their own, without bread or wine, body or blood; the community 'leaders' without followers...\\"" It is an arresting sketch of black urban life, with elements that are as true today as they were fifty years ago; it is a depiction made more powerful by its economy and its brevity.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book elsewhere lacksthose virtues. Ellison can be too long-winded; while reading it, I picked up this book frequently and eagerly, but I also put it down frequently. Also, his commentaries on religion seem sharply drawn but skewed, for they don't acknowledge the role Christian churches and charities play in seeing and helping those people whom society deems invisible.<br /><br />Still, the length of the journey and the occasional bumps in the road shouldn't dissuade the determined reader, for this is a trip well worth taking. In his search for himself and his identity, the narrator proves to be not invisible but mirrored. For in his story, he reflects back on us our own journey, shows us the evolution people of all colors and shades and opacities must make as we determine both who society thinks we are, and who we really are.ding it, I picked up this book frequently and eagerly, but I also put it down frequently.

What could cause people to put up with the horrifying &quot;Battle Royal&quot; depicted early in the novel. It's very simple, actually, as Ralph Ellison repeatedly lets us know. Most human beings treat their fellow men as pawns to be manipulated in order to fulfill certain selfish means. We see this again and again in the novel. The white benefactor to the college views the main character and his university as nothing more than another tax write-off or an antidote to his nagging conscience. When he is confronted with the reality of the deep South, when the horror of the true conditions of most blacks is revealed to him during the road trip, the main character is expelled for exposing these members of society the dean wants to keep &quot;invisible.&quot; The Communist Party also views blacks as nothing more than a special interest group that they can keep in check and manipulate through their rhetoric. To them, the main character, with his great legitimate success and intelligence, is a greater threat than Ras the Destroyer, a mindless thug. Ras is helping the blacks stay invisible, but the main character is pushing them to succeed and forcing society to deal with them as human beings, which the party finds unacceptable. Upon realizing this, the main character at first tries to &quot;defeat them with yeses&quot; as his father advised him and withdraws from the people who cannot see his inner being. However, he concludes that such an acceptance is a betrayal of himself. He decides to learn to start &quot;saying yes and saying no&quot; to the roles that are thurst upon him.<br />What is the universal message here? It is that in this world, social relationships have been established between human beings, but in almost all of these relationships we are restrained from exposing our inner self. Think about it. Try to count how many unwritten rules you follow in you interactions with other people. There are things you can and cannot say, feelings you can and cannot express, ideas that you can and cannot convey, parts of your soul that you can and cannot reveal. It all depends on who you are dealing with. How are we to respond to such a situation? We must &quot;say yes and say no,&quot; we must accept certain boundaries but strive to look beyond them and, little by little, push them back. Pick up a copy of this great American Masterpiece.

It allowed me to understand the structure of society as well as the lifestyle of African Americans in the 1930's. There were many insightful quotes such as \\""I'm in New York, but New York ain't in me\\"" indicating that where you live does not distinguish your personalities and \\""The truth is the light and light is the truth.\\""(Ellison 7) This book also helped me to understand that life is a very complicated journey and sometimes you don't get to choose your destiny.<br /><br /> I like the writing style of the book. The book's writing can be described in two words: simple and explicit. It was very easy to understand, most of the time, what the author was saying. Although it was written in simple text, it doesn't mean that its meaning is not profound. The book had many complex themes and abstract symbols that appear throughout the book. For instance, in page 299, the building of the Brotherhood was called Chthonian, which is the underworld in Greek mythology. This hints to the reader that Brotherhood is perhaps a corrupt organization.<br /><br /> I also like the abstract writing styles. \\""My hole is warm and full of light...I doubt if there is a brighter spot in all New York than this hole of mine, an I don not exclude Broadway... those two spots are among the darkest of our whole civilization.\\""(Ellison 6) In this short phrase the author uses a double meaning on the word light. This kind of writing style helped me to enjoy the novel better and to learn how to write better.<br /><br /> Although, overall, the novel was very compelling, in my opinion the ending was a bit disappointing because it simply ends without conclusion. It seems like a waste to read 580 pages just to find out that the book does not conclude anything. However, this type of ending I would guess is post modernism.<br /><br /> Other than that, the book was very insightful and inspiring.

Ralph Ellison's story of racial injustice in America during the 1950s has widely been hailed as a masterpiece of American literature, a book well-received both for its treatment of controversial subject matter and for its brilliant, almost lyrical prose.  Critics have called Ellison's writing a form of \\""literary jazz,\\"" a style of writing that is constantly changing and improvising, one minute slow and steady, the next fast-paced, shifting, and distorted.  Ellison makes no effort to hide his inspiration, and comparisons between Invisible Man and Dostoevsky's Underground Man, though obvious, are treated with grace and simplicity. INVISIBLE MAN, on all levels, is a relevant, important text.<br /><br />Published in 1952, at the height of the Civil Rights movement in the South, INVISIBLE MAN chronicles the story of a nameless narrator, struggling to find the truth in a world largely built on deception.  The narrator introduces himself merely as \\""an invisible man\\"" who is invisible \\""simply because people refuse to see me.\\""  At the beginning of the novel, Invisible Man is living underground on the outskirts of Harlem, stealing free electricity from a monopolizing power company...symbolically, of course, the only \\""power\\"" he can take from the white man.<br /><br />In the novel, Invisible Man narrates his journey from the segregated South to the cruelly beautiful North as he searches for an identity, a sense of self which he at first attempts to formulate based upon others' opinions of him.  Armed with a lesson from his dying grandfather he doesn't yet fully understand and his own perceptions of the roles of blacks and whites, Invisible Man is thrust into the bustling, harsh world of Harlem, a reality far from the Southern college (based on the Tuskegee Institute) from which he came.  Throughout his journey, Invisible Man must confront difficult questions about himself, dealing with both racial and self-identity.  Although his journey is one of hard-learned lessons about the role of African Americans in society, his story is ultimately one of self-discovery.<br /><br />With beautiful prose, simplistic brilliance, and images that are hard to read and will break your heart (for me, the Battle Royal scene especially), Ellison has written a masterpiece of fiction that unites all readers--black and white--with a story of the journey to self-discovery, something everyone must go through.  Filled with stunning imagery, subtle cultural references, and searing indictments of the racial divide, INVISIBLE MAN is an important text that begs to be interpreted.

Though not lacking in universal themes, it truly is a novel rooted in the American experience, a book that explores many of the complexities of race relations in the United States.  The book ends by refusing to offer an facile answers or to identify any simple villains.  The novel's many villains number as many African Americans as whites, and no true heroes of either race.  The sense at the end is that where race relations are concerned, we in America are getting it wrong from beginning to end regardless of our race.  Moreover, all political persuasions also seem to be guilty of getting it wrong.<br /><br />Structurally, THE INVISIBLE MAN owes a great deal to that genre of the English novel that deals with the coming of age of a youthful hero.  Indeed, this novel could be profitably be compared to TOM JONES, only without the philosophical sidetracking one finds in that novel and set in the United States with a black hero.  Like Tom Jones, the narrator of THE INVISIBLE MAN is thrown by fate from one bizarre experience to another, never being an actor in his own story, but merely a reactor.  The narrator does not seize his own fate, but allows himself to be passively shifted about.  His story is largely told through stringing together a number of bizarre incidents:  a surreal Battle Royal in which a group of young blacks are blindfolded and forced to fight one another for the amusement of a group of whites, who later listen to the battered narrator present a speech that he hopes will win him a scholarship to college.  At college he serves as driver for one of the school's white benefactors, but instead of it being an occasion for furthering his career, the day degenerates despite his best intentions into a pure nightmare, which results in his expulsion from school.  He travels to New York to seek work, but the only thing he gets from his one day of working in a paint factory is a concussion and short term disability payments.  Finally--and this embraces most of the last half of the novel--our hero inadvertently becomes a political speaker for the Communist party (an experience that reflects Ellison's own experience as a political writer for the Communists in the 1930s, though in the novel he refers to them only as The Brotherhood).  His work as a Communist organizer is contrasted with an African Black Nationalist agitator named Ras, who in the tradition of Marcus Garvey believes in the separation of the races.  What links all these adventures together is that throughout the Narrator is never affirmed or perceived for who he is in himself.  All without exception focus on him as a mere member of his race, never on him as an individual.  Indeed, while the Communists are largely lacking in the racism he finds elsewhere, their interest in him largely lies in the use to which he can be put.  They are, in fact, not interested in individuals at all, and even if they are hostile towards class rather than race, they are equally as hostile towards the individual.<br /><br />The novel is profoundly political.  Ellison is equally disenchanted with those who feel that the goal for blacks is to educate them so that they can gradually become more and more accepted in a white-dominated society, with the Communists who want to eliminate the individual for the sake of the group (indeed, who are willing to sacrifice individuals and even groups of individuals for the sake of furthering the purposes of history), and those who call for a radical withdrawal of blacks from all social intercourse with whites.  Instead, he argues at the end of the novel for the primacy of the individual against race, history, or the group.  In the end, he expresses the desire to be viewed as himself, apart from whatever categories can be used to define him.<br /><br />The tone of the book is comic without being truly funny.  There is a surreality about most of the sections of the book.  Given Ellison's political background in Communism, this is of profound significance.  For the Communists, all legitimate fiction had to be starkly realistic.  There is very little realism in THE INVISIBLE MAN.  Much of the novel is comically nightmarish.  In fact, while looking backward the novel reminded me of novels like TOM JONES, looking forward it reminded me of CATCH-22.  I do not know if Joseph Heller was influenced by this book, but I would be very surprised if he was not.  Much as that novel blends the comic and the tragic (though it is far funnier than Ellison's book, or indeed more than just about any other novel), so did Ellison's.  In fact, it is hard to find models for Ellison's book, unless one points to TOM JONES as I have, or perhaps in a vague way to the novels of James Joyce.  Indeed, it is hard to realize what a wildly original novel THE INVISIBLE MAN is, if only because he pioneered a narrative style that became commonplace later.  Another thing to note about his anti-realism style is his characters.  For the most part, Ellison's do not resemble people you would meet in real life.  Many are intentional caricatures, many grotesques in the tradition of Charles Dickens.  All are intended to emphasize the unreality and nightmarish quality of the narrator's life.<br /><br />I truly love this novel.

It dared to exploit the issues of racism at a time when our country most needed it.  It became a standard to which many future black authors would look to.  By some, it is considered the best novel an African American has ever written.  If not, it at least considered by a majority of its readers, an American masterpiece.<br /><br />Invisible Man opens with the narrator telling us exactly what he is and how he came to be like that.  It opens in almost a surrealistic fashion and we are drawn in and instantly captivated.  Ellison sets the mood and we desperately want to learn more.  He then begins with horrific opening scene of his life.  The narrator is never named.  We know from the beginning he is a college educated black man.  He is also an eloquent orator.  In the startling opening sequence to his story, he is manipulated into giving a speech at what he thinks is a dignified event.  It is nothing more than a horrific display of racism in which white men use black anger and fighting as a form of mere entertainment.  This scene sets the mood of the novel<br /><br />After the opening we follow the nameless protagonist through his life.  First, he gets kicked out of college by the black college president for not treating a rich white donor as he should.  This black president promises him a job, but ironically the letters that he sends to all the \\""would-be\\"" employer's of the nameless narrator are in actually warning to not hire him and not letters of recommendations as he promised.  The narrator realizes this and has to take up a job at the local paint making factory.  Here we learn some symbolism of the \\""white\\"" world as Emerson brilliant uses metaphors comparing the paint to racial misunderstandings.<br /><br />Eventually, a member of the \\""brotherhood\\"" which is a black and white semi communist party hears a magnificent speech delivered by the narrator, which he gives to an angry black mob on the verge of an attack on white officers.  The member of this organization is impressed with his speech and the nameless narrator becomes the spokesman in the city of Harlem for this organization.<br /><br />The nameless narrator learns that the organization is merely using him and he is just a pawn for them  The bulk of this story is the narrator coming to grips that he merely is just an invisible man to these people, most of whom are white, and they just use him to their own advantage.  Sadly, the narrator doesn't realize this until it is too late and has been blinded all along by their deception.<br /><br />In the end, the narrator breaks free of their grasp, but also comes to realize that his entire life to this point has been no more than being an invisible man to those around him.  His own self-identity and worth has been lost.  Finally, he gets his redemption and learns who he truly is.<br /><br />It is hard to really name anything wrong with this novel.  The language is beautiful, dark, and almost has a poetic ring to it in certain passages.  It blends the issues of racism, bigotry, and individualism together in an interesting, well told story.  I can't argue with the language or substance.  You can feel that this story meant a lot to the author.  I believe it is an important book on history in America.  Ellison has so much talent and the story is as well told as any I have heard.<br /><br />So, why not a perfect rating for Invisible Man?  If anyone claims it to be a masterpiece I certainly wouldn't argue with them.  For me, it came close, but I just kept waiting for something more to happen.  What exactly? I'm not sure.  It just seems like in order for a book to be a masterpiece something more has to happen.  This book has no real climax.  The ending was also a bit too preachy and wasn't as straight forward as it could have been.  It is like you sit on the edge of your seat waiting for the big explosion, the powerful moment that will take your breath away, but itnever comes.  Of course, not all novels would be appropriate for such a moment or climax, but it seemed a book about these important issues, this powerful statement on the way things are and the way things should be, seemed like it should have had such a moment. It seemed in order to take this book to the next level of genius it needed something more that never was delivered.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a very, very good novel.  It is told with brilliant language, the characters are very realistic and the setting was dead on target.  The power and emotion I thought it would exhume just didn't come to me.  I just wish it could have affected me more somehow.  How it could have done that exactly?  I'm not sure, but I kept getting this feeling that something was missing.  The answer might be as invisible as the character himself.<br /><br />Grade: A-away, but it never comes.  Of course, not all novels would be appropriate for such a moment or climax, but it seemed a book about these important issues, this powerful statement on the way things are and the way things should be, seemed like it should have had such a moment.

It is told with brilliant language, the characters are very realistic and the setting was dead on target.  The power and emotion I thought it would exhume just didn't come to me.  I just wish it could have affected me more somehow.  How it could have done that exactly?  I'm not sure, but I kept getting this feeling that something was missing.

The story is the epic search for an identity, an American identity in a world that labels individuals in order to negate their power.  The titular modern hero represents any man or woman pinioned against the floor of life by the boot of American capitalism which dictates everyone's role in life before they're even born.  It is this maxim which the Invisible Man must discover for himself, i.e. the rules of the game are not what he has learned in school and until he realizes this dichotomy between America the real and America the ideal he moves from school to work to political activisim constantly defeating himself.  The novel is Zen before Zen was in.  The spiritual journey described in images replete with cinema and words that narrate themselves should resonate with any reader who has ever searched for satisfaction, serenity and contentment in life only to find hurt, pain and disappointment in all the commercially prescribed solutions. The work is epic by covering the most salient facets of modern American life from a psychological perspective which attempts to heal the narrator and the reader as well.  A little dated in the sense that it doesn't approach drugs/alcoholism or gay identities, Ellison had little choice but to be conservative so as not to blur the meaning of his message as well as to avoid the political oppression going on in the country at the time.  The novel is sophisticated, intellectual, humorous, magical, adventurous, gargantuan, approachable, and best of all a good read.  I thoroughly recommend this work NOT as an African American novel on identity, but as a novel on AMERICAN IDENTITY.",2005-01-21

As a long-ago resident of Alabama, I can guarantee the non-southern reader (especially) a new and improved connection with the beginning of Ellison's novel.

That truth is that the African-American is hardly viewed at all by the white race. The African-American is unseen, his/her needs not addressed, his/her existence not acknowledged.

For the neophytes reading this, Invisible Man is not merely &quot;a book about overcoming racial injustice&quot; -- as it would appear on the surface to many.  To typecast this work in such a way would do nothing short of a grave disservice to the late Ellison.  Invisible Man, contrarily, transcends mere race and delves into, as Ellison calls it, &quot;the beautiful absurdity of the American identity.&quot;<br />We are all aiding and abetting lies, Ellison says, by judging others in a coldly insular &amp; scientifically calculated manner based solely upon one's outward appearance -- not unlike the The Brotherhood, Norton, Bledsoe, &amp; Ras the Exhorter.  As our hapless (and interestingly nameless), yet undeniably endearing, protagonist astutely states, &quot;The truth is the light and light is the truth.&quot; As he is invisible without truth, the truth, conversely, is unattainable without light.<br />Ellison takes us on a circuitous, if not tumultuous, road to self-awareness that is tragically achieved through his naive and idealistic dreams being systematically shattered by the irrepressibly cynical charlatans in whom he has put his unconditional trust such as the Iago-like Brother Jack.  In a book where perception is anything but reality, Ellison's cryptic characters (such as Brother Jack and his inexplicable use of a foreign language and inscrutable glass eye as well as the ostensibly omnipresent, yet never present, Rinehart) without doubt add to this mysterious, yet pervasive, feeling of uncontrollable helplessness of our protagonist who is being inexorably jettisoned into a blurry chaotic world grossly devoid of right and wrong.<br />Two FYIs: Appropriately, the only letters on the book cover which become &quot;invisible&quot; when looked at from a distance are the two I's.

What kind of message is this book sending out? Is it to give up on your dreams, hopes, and aspirations? That is ultimately what I got out of the book. After reading this book I became unsure of whether or not I actually understood it's meaning. Maybe this was why I found a strong dislike for the book.

This is where the narrator is young and is asked to deliver his speech, made at his graduation, to a group of important white men in his community. When the narrator arrives he is forced to watch a naked woman dance and is then given clothes, which to his dismay are for the purpose of fighting blindfolded in a portable boxing ring with other young black kids. After brutally being attacked many times by other kids, he is left alone in the ring with a much bigger black boy and is forced to fight him.

The narrator is alive because he has his own voice; he is not a caricature.  Second, Ellison resisted (essentialist) Black rhetoric for its own sake.  He was too good a communicator to be a good Black Nationalist pundit.  I'm willing to admit the prose nay seem pretensious at times.

What could cause people to put up with the horrifying \\""Battle Royal\\"" depicted early in the novel. It's very simple, actually, as Ralph Ellison repeatedly lets us know. Most human beings treat their fellow men as pawns to be manipulated in order to fulfill certain selfish means. We see this again and again in the novel. The white benefactor to the college views the main character and his university as nothing more than another tax write-off or an antidote to his nagging conscience. When he is confronted with the reality of the deep South, when the horror of the true conditions of most blacks is revealed to him during the road trip, the main character is expelled for exposing these members of society the dean wants to keep \\""invisible.\\"" The Communist Party also views blacks as nothing more than a special interest group that they can keep in check and manipulate through their rhetoric. To them, the main character, with his great legitimate success and intelligence, is a greater threat than Ras the Destroyer, a mindless thug. Ras is helping the blacks stay invisible, but the main character is pushing them to succeed and forcing society to deal with them as human beings, which the party finds unacceptable. Upon realizing this, the main character at first tries to \\""defeat them with yeses\\"" as his father advised him and withdraws from the people who cannot see his inner being. However, he concludes that such an acceptance is a betrayal of himself. He decides to learn to start \\""saying yes and saying no\\"" to the roles that are thurst upon him.<br />What is the universal message here? It is that in this world, social relationships have been established between human beings, but in almost all of these relationships we are restrained from exposing our inner self. Think about it. Try to count how many unwritten rules you follow in you interactions with other people. There are things you can and cannot say, feelings you can and cannot express, ideas that you can and cannot convey, parts of your soul that you can and cannot reveal. It all depends on who you are dealing with. How are we to respond to such a situation? We must \\""say yes and say no,\\"" we must accept certain boundaries but strive to look beyond them and, little by little, push them back.not say, feelings you can and cannot express, ideas that you can and cannot convey, parts of your soul that you can and cannot reveal.

It is not a book about racism, but about the fact that noone, black or white, saw the protagonist (&quot;him&quot; from now on) for what he was.  Other black people expected him to act a certain way, white people looked down on him, everyone had their own plan for him, wanted him as their own tool, instead of just taking him for what he was. It accurately portrays what it would be like to be a young black man in it's time, torn between the search for success and the search for pride.  On another note, the book does lull at some points, but the style of writing in it's time was different than that of today, so that should be taken into consideration, and the small lulls hardly take anything away from the overall quality of the book-outstanding.

I read it, and finished it, because it was recommended to me by a friend who saw me reading _The Invisible Soldier_ by Mary Penick Motley.<br />The book's dreamlike, and occasionally nightmarish, qualities detract from its effectiveness.  When the narrator takes Norton on the drive around campus, the events turn nightmarish -- through virtually no fault of the narrator, events turn into a drawn-out out-of-control nightmare where things unbelievably keep getting worse and worse.  The narration by Trueblood seems interminable, as do the bizarre events at the Golden Day.<br />Not only does Dr. Bledsoe banish the narrator from college, but he does so in a manner where the narrator doesn't even feel the knife in his back, and even unknowingly becomes the instrument of his own further destruction.  Dr. Bledsoe's actions are typical of those who later interact with the narrator.  Is Bledsoe acting to protect his own position, or the continuation of the college, or the furtherance of the African American race, or to benefit the narrator?<br />Continually through the book, the narrator is faced with the decision of speaking out and becoming a target, or remaining silent and assenting to injustice.  The groups and individuals which attract, use, or attack the narrator are archetypes of later groups in the civil rights movement:  the Brotherhood represents those who would deny African American leadership in the movement in the name of brotherhood and unity, while Ras represents a very separatist movement.<br />For all its historic significance and eloquence, there are better choices than this book.  Ellison himself says in his forward, with regard to African American service in World War II, &quot;How could you treat a Negro as equal in war and then deny him equality during times of peace?&quot;  For an excellent book on African American soldiers in World War II, read _The Invisible Soldier_ by Mary Penick Motley.

There is no graphic sex or violence, but to understand cumulative disillusionments and disappointments seems to me to require experience few teenagers in America have.<br />Be that as it may, this is at once a wise and a funny (mostly satiric, though two fight scenes approach slapstick) book. I enjoy as well as respect it.<br />There is a lot to admire in Ellison's creation of characters and milieux and in his often exhilarating language and shifting style. (Ellison himself characterized it as moving from  naturalism (&agrave; la Richard Wright) to expressionism to surrealism - though the Battle Royale seems already quite surrealist/absurdist to me.) I don't question that it is a great book, but great books (e.g., Moby Dick, The Charterhouse of Parma) are often not perfectly crafted books. The narrator strikes me as being  a little too naive to have survived to junior year in college, so that there is some sense in Dr. Bledsoe's shock and irritation at having to give him Negro in the South 101 instruction.<br />There are too many long speeches (in particular, I'd cut the blind speaker at a Founder's Day assembly) and the narrator seems oddly lacking in sexual desire of any sort -- though he experiences some of what Chester Himes referred to as the absurdities of being a black male with all the fantasies about black virility.

The book starts with the narrator examining his visibility in life. He claims that to society he is merely a invisible man, a worthless colored man. The book later elucidates to the reader that he did not always feel this way. The feelings were more of culmination of the stunning truths that he learned through a series of hard and misfortunate events. He starts out as a very young and intelligent man in high school who wishes to carve out a prosperous and successful future for himself. He ends up receiving a scholarship to a black college in the south. In his junior year he is expelled for an incident to which was not his fault. Still holding on to a shred of hope he is told that he may return to the college if he moves to New York and earns the years tuition. He arrives in Harlem and begins searching for a job, but is later left betrayed when he discovers that the college never had any intentions of readmitting him. The rest of the book outlines his life in Harlem and takes a close look at the further struggles that bring him to the attitude he possess in the beginning of the book.<br />  There were many portions of the book that were difficult to follow due to the diction and style of writing that Ellison uses to develop his story. Yet in the majority of the book Ellison's use of vivid diction and detail only help to bring the book alive as you see the characters and setting of the book take shape in your head. For example, when the narrator receives a job in a paint factory Ellison depicts the scene so clearly and effectively that you can nearly smell the fumes of the paint as you read through the chapter. Ellison also develops the narrator's world through the use of African American dialect, music and folklore. The author has a very unique style of writing in which he is able to clearly set the tone of his book through the usage of his diction, imagery and syntax.<br />  Even though there were many dark and disturbing images in this novel I enjoyed being able to look through the eyes of an African-American during that time period and trying to understand what it was like.

Of the three, Ellison may well prove to be the most timeless. While Native Son, Black Boy and Go Tell it on a Mountain are powerful works, they don't quite measure up to Invisible Man, in terms of sheer literary genius.<br /> While Ellison wears his influences on his sleeve (Dostoevsky, symbolist poets, existentialist writers, etc.[he even borrows his title from HG Wells]), his writing never suffers or sinks beneath the weight of literary associations. His was a unique voice and vision.<br /> Like Dostoevsky's Underground Man, Ellison's narrator has essentially beat a retreat from the world. He holes up in a subterranean room, where he reflects on the the injustices society has dealt him. Dostoevsky's narrator purposely bumps into people on the Nevsky Prospect in order to certify that he is visible and just as important as the next man. Ellison's Invisible Man beats and almost kills a white man he confronts on an empty street, also in order to rationalize his own existence.<br /> Both the underground man and the invisible man are filled with self loathing. Yet, in Ellison's work, the narrator does achieve a sort of spiritual progress and affirmative self-knowledge. He goes from being a pathetically exploited non-being that must acceed to the whims and wishes of the white opressor (the often anthologized battle royal scene at the beginning of the book), to a point near the conclusion of the book in which he can state he is free to pursue \\""infinite possibilities.\\""<br /> Irving Howe, in an overall favorable review of the novel, took Ellison to task on several fronts.

In addition, the message one seems to draw from the book, is that african americans do not matter and cannot overcome racial prejudice.  To reach this conclusion takes 580 pages and a myriad of sureal episodes.  While Ellison provides excellent descriptions that help other characters and environments come to life, the choice to leave his main character and the southern college nameless detracts from the work.

Many portions of the book seem strange and confusing as well.  When the nameless protagonist suffers an accident in the paint factory, it is unclear what procedure he underwent.  Ellison seems to suggest that his character received a frontal lobatomy.  If this were true, how could he feel emotion or rise to prominence.  Also unclear, is the brotherhood's true function.  What is clear however, is that Ellison dehumanizes his white counterparts, believing them to fundamnetally the same.  He seems to belive that each white person wants to take advantage of an black person , for the white person's own benefit.  While naming all the social ills affecting his race and the broader society, he fails to offer any solutions.

He attends college in the south where people such as Dr. Bledsoe and Mr. Norton make new changes in his life that he has to adjust to. They send him to New York to find a job and was told that later he could return to the college, which was in fact a lie. He writes, talks, and visits some of the supervisors and receives very little responses, until he meets Mr. Emerson's son who tells him to work for Liberty Paints, which he is unsuccessful in doing, after getting hurt on the job, and ending up in the hospital. He makes a speech on an eviction that he witnesses and people admire him, including a man named Brother Jack who hires him to work for the Brotherhood. The narrator makes speeches, which makes him well known in the community until he wants to make changes in the Brotherhood and is refused. People, especially in the Brotherhood begin to turn on him and he decides to get away. During the rally he finds a hole in the ground and decides to face the fact of his invisibility. He stays there and burns documents that brought back memories of his past. He figures that his invisibility is permanent and will never change.<br />This book really showed me how ignorant some people in this world can be. In the beginning, the narrator was in fact invisible and kept to himself until many changes began to take part which made him happy after the major transitions in his life. He begins to open up and doesn't care too much of what other people say, do, or how they treat him. But in the end he goes back to the many events that took place earlier in the book and decides to give up and face the fact that he is invisible. He displays a sense of superiority and is omnipotent during his transitional stage in the Brotherhood to others but now towards the end begins to feels powerless.

He is in search of success, friendship, and himself.  Ellison's style of writing can be confusing at times, meaning that Ellison tries to overwhelm the reader, when instead he should be either persuading or telling the story. The novel is written in first person singular and therefore it is hard to distinguish who is who.  It is hard to tell the difference between the person who is telling the story and the person who is being affected.  The middle of the book concerns the Harlem Stalinists who are communist.  Ellison made the Stalinists seem stupid, vicious and pessimistic.  The Invisible Man's final discovery that after he quit the Communist Party, \\""my world has become one of infinite possibilities,\\""(p.365) because he did not want to be rejected nor did he want to be seen by other various social groups.  In my opinion Ellison is a very gifted writer, with an amazing style.  Although Ellison relies heavily on various symbolisms, which can get confusing at times, it helps the reader to get through the book but it does not destroy the book.  Also, Ellison's style is creative because it allows the reader to appear as if they were actually listening to a Negro telling the story, in the sense that Ellison wrote in the vernacular of that time period.  Ellison has an abundance of talent, because he is thoroughly, wildly creative. He makes his writing tense; his language makes the book better to read. Since Ellison lived and observed certain events, which took place during this time, and also since he was black, he understood how to write a book based on the Negro lifestyle during that particular period of time.

In terms of sheer information and hidden subversiveness, this book is a rare treat for those who like to dig deep beneath the surfaces and find what is hidden there. Invisible Man is not merely a work about an alienated black male, it is also the story of American history, and the racism that has been ever present, on the surface and veiled beneath the harmless guise of tradition. The fact that Ellison produced such a biting critique of American society, and was able to get it published, is a miracle in itself. 'Invisible Man' is a powerful statement against the dehumanizing effects of racism in America. Through elaborate symbolism and metaphor Ellison goes about the huge task of trying to expose the rampant institutional and societal racism that manifested itself in practically every corner of American culture. Through the anonymous character of the Invisible Man, we are taken on a tour that begins in the outwardly racist South and ends in the supposedly progressive Eastern city of New York and Harlem. What the Invisible Man discovers about America in his journey is both a powerful social commentary and harsh indictment of the nature of human ignorance and hatred.<br />The Invisible Man is certainly not an easy read, because of the threat of censorship Ellison was forced to submerge his subversive message under the appearance of mild criticism. The result is an extremely deep and complex novel, which often is charged with double-meaning, allusion, and symbolism. One is amazed at the ingenuity and inventedness that Ellison employed in this work, and equally impressed at the final result.<br />This work itself is a testimony that people can overcome racism, prejudice, and hatred, and yet it is at the same time disheartening to see what extreme lengths Ellison had to go in order to express his views, which inherently affects the readers of his novel as well. Although Ellison was able to get his message published, he was forced to do so under a veil of darkness, one that has effectively muffled his message to a great portion of his readers.

It is written in the first person by a protagonist whose name we never learn; by keeping him anonymous, we are able to relate to him better, and it helps to emphasize his &quot;invisibility&quot; with respect to the world.  We know that he is a young black man, comes from somewhere in the South, is a bright student, and is thoughtful, introspective, positive, and ambitious.  This novel is about how he is used, abused, and transformed into a cynic, but its tone is ironic rather than angry or bitter.<br />The novel begins just after his high school graduation, when he is invited to give a speech at a party for his hometown's most prominent white citizens.  They award him a college scholarship, but they also want him to participate in a battle royal where he must fight other young black men for money while the white men watch with delight.<br />With the intention of becoming an educator, he attends a black college whose president is an arrogant pedagogue named Dr. Bledsoe.  Assigned to be a campus chauffeur, he innocently takes a visiting white trustee of the college on an extended tour (on the trustee's request) to the cottage of an incestuous sharecropper and then to a raucous roadhouse.  Bledsoe is enraged when he learns of this excursion and, as punishment for the embarrassment he imagines this has caused the college, gives the protagonist a &quot;vacation&quot; and sends him to New York with a promise to refer him for a job with one of the college's wealthy trustees.<br />Through a cruel trick played on him by Bledsoe, the protagonist ends up working at a paint factory in Long Island for tyrannical bosses, but not for long.  He falls in with a group called the Brotherhood, a vaguely Communist organization that promotes humanism and racial harmony, and is hired to speak at rallies in Harlem.  This fulfills his ambition to become a leader and a voice of the community; even though his fiery speeches are mostly platitudinous, they're what his audiences want to hear.<br />As a public speaker advocating multiracial brotherhood, he must contend with a vociferous black nationalist named Ras the Exhorter, who considers the protagonist a traitor to his race.  When the murder of a young black man by a policeman incites a riot in Harlem, the protagonist realizes that the Brotherhood was just using him as a tool to aggravate Ras and divide the black community upon &quot;with-us&quot;/&quot;against-us&quot; lines.<br />The protagonist's personal condition has a universality in that everyone is born, lives, and dies without a purpose (except maybe a divined one), often leaving no trace of ever having existed in the grand scheme of things.

Ellison develops his own personal convictions within the unnamed protagonist, giving his character depth of understanding imparted by the experiences he encounters.  This anonymous narrator learns not only of racial prejudice during his childhood in the South but also of social ignorance in the North even among other blacks.  Upon first arriving north in New York City, the narrator feels as if he has left behind prejudice social classes and unfair bias, but slowly he begins to realize that in New York or any other place there is no such thing as egalitarian rights and communal respect because of the self-serving minds of other people.  In many characters such as Mr. Norton, Dr. Bledsoe and Brother Jack, Ellison embodies this attitude of ignorance and personal ambition.  In the book Mr. Norton plays a minor role as a university benefactor who only wishes to see the narrator succeed in order to add to his own legacy.  Dr. Bledsoe is the head of the narrator's old college who fears allowing the narrator to stay at the university may bring ill repute to his university.  He only desires to see the narrator fail and even attempts to catalyze this hope by giving him  letters denouncing the narrator's qualifications which he claims to be letters of recommendation.  Shortly after arriving in New York, the narrator meets Brother Jack, who is the head of a civil rights movement.  At the end of the book the narrator learns that Brother Jack has been using him as a speaker to incite citizens for his own alterior motives.  Ellison states through the narrator that his invisibility arises from the negligence of others who are striving toward their goal, too busy to think about him on their way.  In the end of the book the narrator fully grasps and learns that his insignificance in others' eyes is insignificant itself, that his peace and contentment must come from within himself.  Ellison shows ubiquity and timelessness in his philosophy on man and his intrinsic nature, intricately developing Invisible Man to reflect aspects of his own take on life..

It is therefore fantastic literature and riveting social commentary. This style is otherwise a hallmark of much of the post-WWII literature of the former communist bloc in Europe, although very few if any Eastern European writers, whether officially sanctioned or \\""dissident\\"" ever came close to matching Ellison's achievement - even though some of them managed to become more popular.

He calls himself the invisible man, then, because no one sees him for himself.  The novel tells how he comes to this realization and how he concludes that forcing people to conform is wrong and that diversity is a strength. Surprisingly for a black novel set in the 1950s, only about half of his troubles come from racism, and he seems to have little or no internalized racism.

I think race is used as the context of the book because of the world in which the narrator lives.  To me, this book was about isolationism.  The narrator just can't seem to fit into society anywhere. He tries many things, and gets involved with various groups of people.  Unfortunately, for him, even the people he is 'supposed' to trust end up disillusioning him or stabbing him in the back.  As a result, he ends up living in the sewer drains and in a basement apartment no one knows exists. Ellison makes a break, in my view, from the classic mythological hero.  Normally, a hero would return to his world after leaving it, accepting life and reality for what it is, and vowing to exist in it with his or her newfound knowledge.  This doesn't happen in this book. To discuss Ellison' ability as a writer is absurd, because it is a given.  He constantly puts his hero in incredibly disturbing, and wild situations, and we hope our hero can learn from them and move on.  For better or for worse, he seems to give up on humanity, something I have been tempted to do on more than one occasion.  On this level, I could relate to the character.

It is about exploitation, manipulation, and the gross hypocrisy that exists in our society.<br />It is a work of great literary merit.

In it was every book imaginable by the leading lights  of the African-American literary pantheon. Baldwin, Hughes, Hurston,  Wright, Fanon, Brown and of course the weightiest of the tomes at 600-plus  pages, Ellison's Invisible Man. I read through all the slimmer volumes and  never got around to Ellison until I was in college. Even after hearing all  the hype about it for years on end, I was still floored by the book. It was  the kind of book you backtrack while reading, retracing chapters you just  read to see if the initial impact of the words was really that forceful. I  empathized with the book and it's protagonist because having just gone  through my early adolescence and teens I sensed his feeling of  longing...and need for belonging.

It was more powerful than before. It's tale of a search for identity in a  land where your identity is denied rings even truer in this time of  assimilation/balkanization.

When I put this book on the syllabus of English Literature at the University of California in 1973, Fall quarter, it was the first time a novel by a black  author was thus proposed to the wide public of the university (English III,  Initiation to English Lieterature). I chose it because it is a book that  goes beyond pure racial concerns and reaches a higher level. It is based on  a « white » metaphor : the White House, a plant producing white paint, in  short a whole metaphor about being whitewashed and brainwashed. This comes  to the concept of invisibility. It appears in a Harlem riot. A black man is  unseen by his white fellow citizens. Either completely, so he has no  existence whatsoever, or partially and he is only seen within a « white »  frame of mind and of existence. To be seen the black man must be white (in  behaviour, in personality, etc), i.e. must conform to a stereotype that  fits in white ideology, which of course justifies any kind of segregation.  But the best of all vision in the book is the confrontation of the hero  with the black general secretary of the Communist Party of theUS. This man  has only one eye and the other eye is made of glass, and the confrontation  is centered on the dropping of this glass eye into a plain drinlking glass.  This man, who is black, who is a revolutionary, who wants things to be  changed (in a stalinist way, maybe, but changed nevertheless) has a  one-eyed vision of the world and he becomes the symbol of all politicians  who can only see what they have decided to see, who can only have, due to  there partisanship, a one-sided, hence biassed, vision. It is an allusion  to the « two »-party system. It is an allusion to the division of Congress  in two bodies : the Senate and the House of Representatives. It is an  allusion to the division between Congress and the White House, to the  division between the Federal Government and the States' governments, to the  division between Congress and the states' legislatures, etc. The US is a  dual system but anyone standing anywhere can only have a one-eyed vision,  or at best several one-eyed visions that are contradictory and hence never  brought together. So the end of the book is a metaphor of roots for the  Blacks:  underground in a cellar, a black coal cellar, entirely illuminated  with white electric light, hundreds of white electric lights to make things  and the hero visible, but in an egocentric cocoon that is centered on the  black man himself. No one can see him. We are of course in 1952, before the  Civil Rights Movement, before Martin Luther King, and many others, before  the Black Nationalist Movement, the Black Culturalist Movement, the Black  Panther Party, etc. These movements are going to make Afro-Americans  visible, especially with the help of the media. These movements are going  to highlight the invisible violence the Blacks were the victims of, and  make this violence regress. But the new strategy, and it is contained in  the book already, of white society will be to divert white violence into  the black community so it became black violence against blacks, a  self-destructing violence meaning that the whites can wash their hands of  it. That is the meaning of the riot that destroys Harlem, but with fire and  violence coming from the blacks themselves : they destroy their own  community because they see it as a symbol of their being rejected and their  being submitted to segregation. In other words it is a reaction without a  dream. There is no dream.

Many critics may debate the merits of any  individual who can claim to cover all of the cleavages of society within  one work, yet Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man stands up nearly forty years  after its original publication as a testimony to the dynamics of American  society and more importantly, the systemic race 'problem' that America  continues to manipulate and feel guilt for.  Invisible Man narrative style  allows Ellison to make poignant observations about the many distinctive  ways of life in America: the differences between North and South; black and  white, communist and capitalist, inner city and the privileged few and  gender differences; these are all major societal distinctions that  invisible Man stumbles upon along his road to realization and  disillusionment in American society.  Upon this examination of the work,  Invisible Man is doubly recognized for providing a unique commentary of the  continued degradation of Black America, complete with a distinctive black  culture and way of life, but also for its ability to reach out and embrace  elements of Literature such as the bildungsroman genre.  Invisible Man's  journey across the American landscape acts as a journey across time and  become an education about America at a time of expansive consumerism and  international interest expansion.  This book is a highly recommended read  that seeks to uncover a perspective about America that today may seem  commonplace, but in its time, was rather revolutionary.",2000-05-30

Invisible Man is a portrait of the early 20th century and the role of  racism in the culture. Ellison writes from the point of view of a young  black man, the narrator, who takes a roller coaster ride throughout the  south and finally Harlem. While reading the Invisible Man, Atticus and his  points of view come to mind many times. The narrator and Atticus both fight  for black rights in a time of prejudice and injustice. Both of them are  respected members of their communities and set an example for many people;  Atticus for his children and certain townsfolk, and the narrator for his  \\""brotherhood\\"" and Harlem. Ellison explains the emotional turmoil of one  human characteristic, racism. The narrator is a young black man scraping  his way to the top, in contrast Atticus is a well-off white man, respected.  I liked how I got a perspective from both sides of the struggle, white and  black. When I was reading about the \\""Brotherhood\\"" and its \\""fight\\"" against  racism there were many comparisons to the court and jury in To Kill a  Mockingbird. Both were meant to do good and bring justice and  understanding, while upholding values. But, like many institutions, they  weren't doing their designed purpose. They, in their own point of view were  doing good. But, reality they were plagued by self-interest. The court's  justice was subverted by the jury and the \\""brotherhood's\\"" moral community  lessened by their scientific analysis of everything, including humans,  which I think can't be analyzed. What happened to these institutions  demonstrates how even the best intentions can be turned into evil. Through  the narrator I learned much about the politics and mannerisms of the early  20th century. At times the book is dark and moody, almost crazy. At other  times, it is also humorous and funny. The style of writing changes many  times and really conveys all different feelings such as anger, hope,  isolation, happiness, and craziness. I feel that Invisible Man focused on  the Black point of view on racism and how it felt, while To Kill a  Mockingbird represented the point of view of whites. As Invisible Man  starts, it took place in the South. It was slow, with lots of description  that I barely made through, but progressively it picked up with the plot  coming to a turbulent climax. Throughout the story Ellison really developed  the characters, which drew me into the story. Although the book was very  slow at times, I think it's great. I am an avid reader and this has been my  most challenging book so far. Ellison used many metaphorical references  from an early time which I, a 14 year old, didn't understand. I suggest you  only read this if you are much older than me. I recommend this to anyone  that wants a book full of depth, a look at racism and its effect on people.lly conveys all different feelings such as anger, hope,  isolation, happiness, and craziness.

He comes to this conclusion through a series  of events that includes a prize-fight and a Communist rally.  I read this  book for my eighth-grade independent reading project as we read To Kill a  Mockingbird in class; part of our purpose in reading both books  simultaneously was to be able to compare our two books' views on race.  Invisible Man, I found, is in many ways the opposite of To Kill A  Mockingbird in the way it views race.  For instance, To Kill A  Mockingbird's author, Harper Lee, holds that through the judicial system  and the efforts of non-racists, we will build a more equal society;  Invisible Man's author, on the other hand, holds that liberation is really  a new form of oppression and betrayal.  The protagonist says of the leader  of an organization that he joined, \\""That he, or anyone else at that late  date, could have named me and set me running with one and the same stroke  of the pen was too much.\\""  This betrayal by one he thinks is working to  help him happens repeatedly throughout the book.  Overall, Ellison paints a  cynical portrait of relations between blacks and whites, as is shown by the  words of a black figure, \\""...the dumbest black b----d in the cotton patch  knows that the only way to please a white man is to tell him a lie!\\""  The positions taken by the authors of the books may reflect their personal  experiences with racism in their lives.  It is thus worth noting that  Ellison is a black man, while Lee is a white woman.  Both books draw on the  lives of their authors, but Ellison lived his story, whereas Lee was mostly  an observer.  Another difference between the two lies in their varying  degrees of characterization.  Ellison's characters are all relatively  faceless, but in Lee's writing, it is only the black characters who are not  developed.  Ellison, who is writing about invisibility, might thus be  making a point with his blurred distinction between black and white, that  it is not race that determines a person's character.  Lee, on the other  hand, depicts the world so familiar to her - the world that is rigidly  polarized along racial lines.  Reading the two books in tandem allowed  me to see an issue through two sets of eyes, thus offering a broader, more  complete view.  I found Ellison's writing a bit confusing at first, as well  as quick-paced, but after reading carefully, his words became clear and the  pace seemed natural.  The pace and confusion also fit in with Ellison's  message of chaos and subversion.  Every time Ellison's writing forced me to  stop, there was some profit to be gained, some greater understanding, that  made the pause worthwhile.  I therefore highly recommend the book.who is writing about invisibility, might thus be  making a point with his blurred distinction between black and white, that  it is not race that determines a person's character.

Both books offer different points of view on the horrible racism of America in  the 1930s.  Invisible Man is told through the main character's point of  view, so the author's views on racism are fully expressed. This is similar  to To Kill a Mockingbird because the story is told from a first person in  that book as well. The major difference between the point of view from  which the two stories are told is that in TKM, the story is told through  the eyes of a young white girl, and in Invisible Man it is told from a  black man's point of view. The writing is somewhat similar to To Kill a  Mockingbird but Invisible Man is darker and more cynical, which makes sense  considering that the author of TKM is a white woman, while the author of  Invisible Man is a black man. A person's views on racism would be more  pessimistic and negative if they had been oppressed and were subjected to  racism, and more optimistic and positive if they hadn't. Ralph Ellison must  have been discriminated against, up to the point that Invisible Man is  somewhat of an autobiography of his struggles with racism. His book is very  pessimistic towards the idea of racism ending, as the main character is  betrayed again and again by white people. Harper Lee, on the other hand,  wasn't oppressed due to her race and therefore her book is optimistic that,  over time, racism will go away. A person's beliefs on a subject are greatly  affected if that person has been harmed by the problem. I gained a better  understanding of the horrible conditions black people suffered not that  long ago while reading this book, and that alone is worth the price of  admission. Two thumbs up.",2000-05-16

I amin the eighth grade and I read the book because I had read To Kill aMocking Bird and I wanted to contrast the two books.  The two books were similar; both were about racism and the difference between black and white people.Invisible Man is about a black man who says he is invisible because people look right through him because he is black. To Kill a Mocking Bird is about a young white girl who lives in a small town.  One of the big characters in the book is a black man named Tom Robinson who is accused of raping a white woman.  Despite these similarities the books had many differences.  Both books were similar in subject but very different in the point of view in respect to race.  To kill a mockingbird is narrated by a young, naive white girl named Scout.  Scout is ignorant to the difference between black and white people in society.  She does not understand why black people are treated worse and not given the same rights as white people. Invisible Man is narrated by an unnamed black person who understands better the differences in the ways that blacks and whites are treated. None of the characters in Invisible Man were developed very well, especially some of the black characters.  This further illustrated the invisibility of black people in society.  Since black people are ignored in society Ellison illustrated this by not developing the black characters as to try to let them blend into the story better. These reasons were just some of the reasons why I thought that this was a great book.  It was very interesting and very educational.  It had very interesting action scenes that were very descriptive.  I also thought that it was very educational.  It taught a lot about race relations.  I would definitely recommend this book.",2000-05-16

Prejudice and  difference give rise to persecution and discrimination. It is frightening  to think of a human being so tangible and real can be obliterated  mercilessly just because he's different.

Naive but intelligent, he finds his journey at all turns defined by race.  Initially he sees only the overt implications of America's racial divide; later, he is unable to see beyond the  subtleties of a complicated social problem. Eventually he comes to  understand his &quot;invisibility,&quot; the inabilitiy of others to see  him as HIM.  In fact, he comes to understand that they can't see him at all  -- they see the world THROUGH him, and manage to continue to see the world  with their own poor vision.<br />Nameless but not voiceless, naive yet  shrewd, trusting while becoming increasingly cynical, the protagonist's  attempts at self-realization are beaten down under a weight too great for  any man of ambition to hold up beneath -- in this case the weight of a  society that chains its members with prejudice.  For his part, the  protagonist largely rejects violence, repudiates thoughtless hatred, and  struggles with what options remain in a swirling world of chaos and racial  insanity.<br />The closest the author comes to a definitive statement is in  the Epilogue, where he writes: &quot;Whence all this passion toward  conformity anyway? -- diversity is the word.  Let man keep his many parts  and you'll have no tyrant states.  Why, if they follow this conformity  business they'll end up by forcing me, an invisible man, to become white,  which is not a color but the lack of one.  Must I strive toward  colorlessness? But seriously, and without snobbery, think of what the world  would lose if that should happen.  America is woven of many strands; I  would recognize them and let it so remain.&quot;  At the end of that  particular paragraph he concludes, &quot;None of us seems to know who he  is, or where he is going.&quot;<br />While society rolls forward in spite of  its self-made ball and chain, individuals suffer for the shackles.

I liked the book and would  recommend it to pretty much anyone.  I have already recommended it to many  people including most of my family.  Pretty good.",2000-03-03

We are captivated by a supposed &quot;Invisible Man&quot; who lives in a basement in the city.  As we read the first chapter, we're left with many questions.  Who is he?  Why is he  invisible?<br />So the author starts the story out from the begininning deep  in the south.  This boy, a black student, excells at his work and social  life.  However, it turns for the worse when he drops out of a fully paid  for negro colleg and is forced to move to New York city.<br />Of course these  questions were answered, but gradually.  I believe this was the problem I  had with the book.  It was a very slow read.  The action is inconsistent.  It starts of strong, but then you are just reading to set the plot.  This  took longer than I expected.<br />In conclusion, this book ought to be read by  people interested in the life of an educated black student who encounters  racial issuses.  These racial issues prevent his sucess in life, and  prevent him from developing an identity.  Also, along the way, Ellison does  a good job of describing the emmotiongs which are felt by the invisible  man.",2000-03-03

Racism plays a major role in prohibiting the narrators success, as many white meen try to  keep him, as they said in the envelope, &quot;running&quot;. Additionally,  the narrator often becomes invisible when the situation is not favorable to  him. it sounds complicated, and it is, but this book has a way of showing  you what life looks like from the outside and in many ways its not pretty  On his graduation day, he delivers a speech that is very profound. It  preaches humility and submission as the key to achievement of black  Americans. The speech can be applied to anyone's life, as we all encounter  situations where we need to be humble and acknowledge who the authority is.  later, the narrator said something that I will never forget. He was talking  about how he realized that, as he was struggling to succeed, he was also  loosing some of himself and his black culture. He stated that &quot;by  being less, you achieve more&quot; and i thought this was a great quote;  applicable to anyone's life.  In conclusion, the majority of this book is  somewhat hard to understand and at times boring, as the narator can tend to  be redundant for several pages at a time. However, overall this book has  many insights to life and dealing with its oddities.

It begins with the character describing himself as an &quot;Invisible Man&quot;.  Not a ghost, or a freak experiment, but a physical man, who nobody knows, cares about, or notices.  Even when he attempts to rob someone, wht man thinks its all a dream.  The character is disappoined, but is happy with his invisibility.  Then, he describes how he became this way.  His life began in the South, where in grade and high school he was pushed to do his best.  Then, his grandfather died, and his last words were not to submit, to do his race proud, and not degrade it by going by the will of the white men.  Those words plagued his life, and formed his views on how black men should live their lives, including himself.  Getting his college scholarship was a nightmare (he ended up doing exactly what the white men wanted him to do) but he got it, and he spent a few years there too.  He was happy, until he was asked to give a guided tour of the campus to the founder of the college.  Though he did show him what he wanted to see, it was not what the college wanted him to see, so the kicked out the \\""&quot;Invisible Man&quot;\\"".  He was then sent to New York with papers the man thought would get him a job so to get back to the college the next year.  However, with the assistance of Mr. Earnshaw's secretary (his own son), he found out the true intentions of the school.  Mr. Earnshaw was the head of one of the companies the school recommended for the character to work for, but the truth was the school wanted him to continously work, own secret reasons for doing what they do.  Now, the &quot;Invisible a big company.  He did just that, too.  After a slight accident in a paint producing factory, he began working, but he also got involved in a underground organization called the Brotherhood.  The Brotherhood was an organization of college grad blacks who knew their place in a white man's worlk, but they also knew how importaqnt and necessary they were.  They considered themselves valuable, so were confident, and so was the &quot;Invisible Man&quot; He was becoming very important to the treacher begins.  The &quot;Invisible Man&quot; eventually got back stabbed by Rez, a member of the Brotherhood, who was also coinciding with another big organizitation.  He managed to blame the character for the increased involvement of the rival gang-for the very existance of the gang itself-so was nearly killed.  However, he managed to escape, and talked to Jack, the head of the Brotherhood, where he found out he was invaluable, unwanted, unimportant, and Invisible.  No one cared for him or about him.  He was indeed Invisible.  So then, he became the &quot;Invisible Man&quot;.y they were.

I was assigned this book for a English class at Henry Ford Community College.  My teacher was Pedro San Antonio.  Before i opened up the book, i was hating  the fact that it was 500 and something pages.  As i began to read, i was  getting deep into the reading.  It is sad, as i read other reviews of this  novel, that most of you do not scratch beneath the surface of the book.  There is alot of sybolism, amoung other things, but the most important part  of this is not the writing itself, it is the meaning behind it.  This novel  is about a man's struggle to become a man, and not to live like the  homeless man he met up with carrying a basket with blueprints.  The  invisible man does not give up, even though he is shot down at every  attempt he makes.  He struggles to find a community, he has no belonging.  This is not a race factor, this is a reality factor.  This book can happen  to anybody.  This book has alot of symbolism to ralph ellison himself.  Do  some research on Ralph Ellison before you decide to give this book 1,2,3,4  stars.  Better yet, take English 132 at the school i went to, and have the  teacher that taught me this book, teach it to you.  Every word, every  meaning, every event, has a deeper aspect to it.

Find out why Optic paint was used.  Optic meaning (sight) and..the  whitest of white paint..was mixed by a black man, putting black drops into  it.

Had the IM encountered the eviction before he had run into the yam seller, the resulting events could not have possibly unfolded in the manner in which they did, for up until the time when the IM meets the yam seller, he is still trying to be &quot;white&quot; and &quot;upper class.&quot; Indeed, the IM initially sees the yam seller as only an &quot;old man, wrapped in an army overcoat, his feet covered with gunny sacks, [and] his head in a knitted cap&quot; (263).  The yam seller represents everything that the IM is trying to distance himself from -- his blackness, his roots in black folk culture, and his southern heritage.  Yet the IM is hungry, and so he approaches the yam seller for food.  It is hunger, the most primal of instincts, that fuels the IM towards the realization that yams are his &quot;birthmark&quot; and he ut! ters &quot;I yam what I am&quot; as he makes the epiphanal discovery that he &quot;no longer [feels] ashamed of the things [he] had always loved&quot; (266).  As the IM wonders &quot;what and how much&quot; he's lost &quot;by trying to do only what was expected&quot; of him, instead of doing what he &quot;had wished to do&quot; (266), he wanders upon the eviction of the Provos.  The ensuing eviction, as visually saddening as it is, is also visually symbolic, for the articles scattered about on the cold Harlem sidewalk are the first things the IM sees with his &quot;new&quot; eyes.  The descriptions of the various objects that draw the IM's attention are representative of many examples of black folk culture.  Ellison captures everything from the &quot;knocking bones&quot; and straightening comb, to the lucky stone (High John the Conqueror) and the rabbit's foot in his characterization of the African Diaspora.  And the Diaspora subtly spreads to the Caribbean to become pan-African as well, as mention is made of the Ethiopian flag, Marcus Garvey, and the &quot;free papers.&quot; I believe Ellison includes the &quot;free papers&quot; in the Provos' belongings to blend the papers' historical significance (i.e. the Sam Sharpe Rebellion) with the significance of the IM's sermon as he confronts the &quot;white establishment&quot; to defend humanitarianism (i.e. the Provos' eviction).  Actually, the Sam Sharpe Rebellion of 1831-1832 in Jamaica is a truly historical event of great significance for it eventually led the way for other Jamaican slave revolts to follow, and the impetus for the Sam Sharpe Rebellion was &quot;free papers.&quot; Sam Sharpe was not only a Jamaican slave, but also a charismatic orator and religious leader in the 19th century. He asserted a rumor amongst the Jamaican slaves that their free papers (i.e. official government papers granting freedom) had arrived from England, and were being &quot;withheld&quot; by the white planters. Sharpe's motive, as Leonard Barrett writes in The R! astafarians, was to initiate a non-violent revolution by letting the slaves begin to &quot;mentally, psychologically, and eschatologically [cease] being slaves&quot; (44).  In other words, the revolution was intended to halt the deprivation of &quot;wealth&quot; (i.e. freedom, privilege, economic stability, etc.) that was trickling through the slaves' hands.  When the IM runs up the steps of the Provos' building and shouts, &quot;They ain't got nothing, they cain't get nothing, they never had nothing.  So who was dispossessed? (279), he parallels Sam Sharpe's ideology of revolution by illustrating how one segment of society suffers, while another segment of society gluttonizes on &quot;wealth&quot; accumulation.  Furthermore, by crying out &quot;Laws, that's what we call them down South Laws! And we're wise, and law-abiding,&quot; (278), the IM subtly refers to the evil and injustice of the eviction by exhorting the natural equality of man with regard to being assured of a warm and safe place to live.  The ensuing results of the IM's sermon culminates in a &quot;revolution&quot; of sorts.  People burst into action and activity (they take things back inside the Provo's apartment), and they continue to be carried away by the IM's impassioned speech (they begin to think about organizing, demonstrating, and marching).  The IM himself eventually joins the Brotherhood.  Thus Moving Day in Harlem is born, for even though the Provos were evicted, the IM prompted a &quot;Move,&quot; - a forward thrust of upward mobility&quot; for himself, the Provos, and Harlem - towards equality, justice, honor, and truth.f a warm and safe place to live.

It will still be in print,  read, and discussed 100 years from now.<br /> Many of the negative reviews listed here tell us what they don't like about the book. I would much rather hear what they do like, for I have trouble believing they find any flaws truly fatal. Others seem to categorize the work into some perceived African-American genre. This is like considering Moby Dick to be a story about the whaling industry.<br /> In Invisible Man, Ellison attempts, and resoundingly achieves, a searching, multilayered exploration of the human experience, in particular the relationship between individual and society. His imagery and overall writing are hauntingly beautiful, resonating deeply within the reader on many subconscious levels. His writing skill is so great that his artifice remains invisible (sic).<br /> In the world of novels, or in all of literature, for that matter, there are many craftspersons, but relatively few artists with real staying power. Invisible Man is a work of real art, comparable to  Picasso's Guernica or Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. You can love it or hate it, but it will be around for a long time.",1998-01-23

It never fully worked for me, but kept me wanting to read the whole way through.  I definitely think it is worth reading, for there are some really powerful chapters.  But there were so many chapters that weren't needed.  And you don't even sympathize with the main character.  His actions are sketchy all the way through.  But I still recommend it.",1997-11-29

His stylish<br />prose and Dostoevsky like insight into the human psyche<br /> give his characters a rare depth.  The nameless protagonist<br /> gives us his life in words and the adventure is as<br /> varying as the landscapes Ellison paints; from a stint<br /> at a black college for the promising young man to<br /> the Communist ladder-climber being used by the American<br /> Reds as a tool for propaganda.  The straight storytelling sans the idealogical<br /> bent to this tome is refreshing after reading socialist<br /> or narcissistic rants of earlier black authors.

To read this book is to be hooked by the sensual words told by a nameless face, but a face of beauty. When you read this book, the words grab you and take you to a new understanding of life. Told through the eyes of a young southern man trying to make it in the world but getting pushed and thrown down at every attempt he makes. The Invisible Man is a classic and an unforgetable novel that you won't want to put down once you have read the first line",1997-04-22

Ina noble story, Ellison manages to leave me mystified at the end, a task not as easy as one might think.  Plagued, if that is the word, by a great many loose ends, this novel still manages to make the reader reflect upon his own soul, and acknowledge his own injustice. Perhaps, in my opinion, the only real problem to this book is its author's knowledge of his own power. The greatest novels have always been written with very meek intentions, while, it seems to me, Ralph Ellison knows damn well what this book will do to us, and never lets us forget it. All around, however, I enjoyed it.  -Anthony Gabriele",1996-11-29
