US,10514199,R3BUJIX52FB760,B00817RYCG,458864358,Catch-22,Books,5,1,1,N,N,"Painfully Funny","Let me preface this by saying that I have never really reviewed a classic, so this is a new sensation for me. But I felt too strongly about this book not to. Anyway...<br /><br />Catch-22 chronicles fictional characters in a fictional country fighting in the very real World War II. The majority of these characters are soldiers with interesting names and even more interesting idiosyncrasies. The primary character (in the myriad of characters) is a fellow named Yossarian with a stronger than usual disdain for his superior officers and the authority they hold over him. You can't really blame him for said disdain, as Colonel Cathcart is continually raising the number of missions required to complete service.<br /><br />With this trend, you'd think that more soldiers would rebel. However, most of them are only quietly disgruntled and surprisingly contented. The catch in Catch-22 states that &#34;a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes the necessary formal request to be relieved of such missions, the very act of making the request proves that he's sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.&#34; Aside from death, desertion, or indefinite physical illness (which Yossarian often relies on), there is legitimately no way out. (I never quite got the 22 part of Catch-22. There's not a catch 1-21... :P)<br /><br />Anyway, this is easily one of the funniest books I've read in my life. But, thing is, I can't really explain why it's so funny. A whole lot of it made me chuckle to myself, but huge chunks of it made me laugh out loud until I almost cried. Seriously, this is a funny book. Again, I'm not sure why, but that doesn't change the fact that it is. Especially the scene with the moaning men... Good gosh, scenes like that I had to read over and over because they are simply too comical to only read once.<br /><br />Despite the hilarity, this book can be confusing, what with the multitude of characters and the fact that the story doesn't necessarily follow a chronological order. Also, if you're like me and know next to nothing about the military ranking system, it can become daunting trying to keep up with who is in charge of whom. It all gets a bit overwhelming when you think about it too much. The process I took to reading this was to try not to overthink everything. I just sort of accepted it all, let it roll over me. It's definitely not a slow read, but the reading process itself can be quite time consuming.<br /><br />I was also pleasantly surprised when a story began forming out of the babble. Don't get me wrong; I enjoyed the book from the start, but, for a very long while, it seems like nonsensical ramblings from irrational soldiers and unreasonable officers. For that long while, it seems almost like Joseph Heller is painting a portrait of each individual character but leaves no overlap from character to character. There are the characters and there is the world, but the story of those characters and that world itself emerge slowly and out of a clutter of confusion.<br /><br />I guess it's to be expected with a war story, but there are harsh bits of tragedy that just pop up in the book. You can't have a war without violence or bloodshed, but the brutality in these pages is thrown in randomly and without warning. Some of the passages manage to freeze the world for a moment. Most of the story is a goofy, ironic view of the world. It's so absurd and silly the majority of the time that it is very easy to forget the serious subject in which it is really about.<br /><br />All in all, I think this is a brilliant book. You probably had to be pretty bright back then to get a word added to the dictionary, before everyone became ridiculous.<br /><br />As for the ending, I think it is perfect-the only way out of the Catch that makes sense for Yossarian, but I won't say more. Apparently there is a sequel, but I am not yet sure if I want to read it. I hate when sequels ruin the original for me, and that happens more often than not. Unlike lots of other books with lots of others words, all of the words in this particular book feel necessary. I wouldn't add or detract a thing.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: I intend to name my next pet Yossarian. It just feels right.",2015-08-24

You might abandon it as well","When I told my friends that I was reading Catch-22, one of them said “I tried reading it once, but left it after reading hardly the first 50 pages. It is full of poor jokes. You might abandon it as well.” What he didn’t know is once I start reading a book I cannot leave it without finishing it. I cannot even take up another book without finishing reading the previous one. And I am proud of that trait of mine, especially now, because I didn’t quit reading Catch-22. Yossarian is a lead bombardier for the United States of America, posted overseas and wants to live. He swears on his one and only life that everybody out there is trying to kill him. On top of that his superiors are raising the number of missions he has to fly if he wants to go home. As soon as he gets the number, he gets notified that the number of mission per person has been raised again. He complains to his friends about this constantly, but flies the missions anyway. Often he finds himself standing up for himself and others demanding to be sent home, but his superiors somehow convince him to fly more.<br /><br />There are simply too many characters in this novel. You will get confused with who is who and who does what. Though they are too many in number, they all are unique character-wise. Only by the time you finish half of the book, will you be clarified with your doubts. But by then, one by one Yossarian’s friends die or disappear. Though it is Yossarian who is afraid of losing his life more than anybody else, others die before him. Your heart will go out for the Chaplain and you will hate Colonel Cathcart and Colonel Korn from the bottom of your heart and gut. This novel evidently makes you understand the plight of every person who was overseas fighting not knowing what for accurately. There are many highlights in the story. An argument between Yossarian and Lieutenant Scheisskopf’s wife about existence of God on Thanksgiving Day, an argument between Nately and an old Italian man aboutwhy or why not one should fight for the country and effect of war-destroyed Rome on Yossarian to name a few highlights. Icing on the cake is the last chapter. Everything happens at once that you wish to be there with Yossarian, Major Danby and the Chaplain. This novel on the whole is truly one of the greatest novels of the century.<br /><br />“Every victim was a culprit, every culprit a victim, and somebody had to stand up sometime to try to break the lousy chain of inherited habit that was imperiling them all.”<br /><br />Joseph Heller, hats off to you.",2015-07-22

It is also one of the most profound pieces of American literature to be written. It is hilariously sobering, and brilliantly insane. This impressively original novel is assured a spot on bookshelves far into the future.  Catch 22 gives the reader an omniscient perspective of one who is completely sane in a world of pure insanity, the world of USAAF airmen in Italy during World War II. These men face the prospect of death regularly but find themselves in an inescapable situation due to paradoxical bureaucratic rules. Their thoughts and actions are made apparent to us as they try to preserve their sanity, or at least stay alive. In the novel, it seems, it is nearly impossible to do both.  Heller’s wit is insanely sharp. This war novel is an extremely funny read which had me laughing throughout. The characters’ motives and secrets which are revealed to us can only be described as humorous. The book’s message, however, isn't funny. Heller uses his original brand of exaggerated satire to make a statement about the insanity of war and the impossible situations soldiers find themselves in. In a broader sense, one could interpret it as a statement about 20th century society in general. It shows that people care most about themselves, and it shows that everyone is completely batshit crazy. Call me crazy, but I think there is some truth to this.  Catch 22 also shows how little people know about the wars they are fighting in. It may be funny, but is also extremely gruesome. It makes the horrors of war apparent and makes us ask, “Why do we do this?”  Joseph Heller’s first novel was unlike anything written before it. It is a brilliant satire and the funniest war novel ever written. Dr. Strangelove, a 1963 satire film, also touches upon the insanity of war in a way that makes me wonder if it was influenced by Catch 22, which was published just two years before. I think Catch 22 is more funny. It encompasses the insanity of war in a way never done before. It doesn't make sense, because neither does a lot of the world.",2015-05-14
US,20075180,RBHJOS8EIDYFS,B00817RYCG,458864358,Catch-22,Books,5,0,0,N,N,"One of my favorite books of all-time","I had to read this book again.  This classic is one of my all-time favorite novels.  I envy Heller for the words and emotions that he is able to put to paper.  Some, granted, may find Catch-22 a bit too smart-ass.  The novel is filled with humor, sarcasm, senseless contradictions, irony and satire.  But, I hate spoilers, so there will be none in this review.<br />Catch-22 is a character-driven novel based around the exploits of World War 2 bombardier John Yossarian.  Yossarian’s squadron is based near Rome and North Africa.  There is a whole cast of zany characters.  I am not a proponent of war, but this novel really expounds on some of the stupidity and government wastefulness that happens during wartime - or at least in this book.  The reader, if he or she is not from a military background, will begin to wonder if these things can really possibly happen during a war, and begin to believe it possible.  The premise of the book is that one would have to be crazy to want to fly a mission, or more missions.  But The Great Loyalty Oath states that one is crazy to unwillingly continue to fly dangerous combat missions.  That’s the catch, the Catch-22.  As the novel progresses, the reader, Yossarian, and the rest of the gang begin to realize that there are all kinds of other Catch-22’s lurking around that they are completely unaware of.<br />War is war and the war goes on.  People live and people die.  More people come to replace those who are lost.  However, the humor, irony and satire are not lost in this wonderful book by Joseph Heller that I will probably read again and again.  A little humor never hurt anyone,eh?<br /><br />Cameron",2015-04-02

To be sure, it's a simple humor, dressed up in pseudo-intellectualism; but it reminds me of some of my friends when they would make an odd comment simply for the sake of absurdity and then try to explain to me how what they said actually made total sense.  They were funny and quirky and fun.  However, they also had other moods and other traits, and my interactions with them were deeper than simple banter.  What this book suffers from is using a device too much.  To me, great artists - of any type - have a large toolbox.  They may not be masters at using every one, but they are knowledgeable and proficient with each.  But most importantly, they know when to use each one - or perhaps more to the point, when NOT to use each one.  In Catch-22, Heller picks up one brush (absurdity) and uses it endlessly, repeatedly, for 500 some pages.  This isn't masterful, and it almost comes across as an exercise, almost like a musical etude.  For me, the trick is not to find something great and use it endlessly.  That is sloppy and sophomoric.  The real mastery in any art is using a tool only where it has greatest effect, to moderate yourself and allow yourself to use other tools.  Otherwise, the effect you are aiming for loses its meaning and poignancy.  By being relentlessly absurd - granted some argue he was doing this purposefully to make us feel the absurdity - he's created an absurd book.

I don't believe it was assigned; rather, it was one of those revolutionary, counter-cultural books that you just HAD to read (Like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). At the time, the Vietnam War was winding down, the \\""counter-culture\\"" had come and was rapidly going, and unbounded faith in the wisdom and integrity of authority (especially governmental authority) seemed dubious, at best. Although it was published a number of years prior to that, Catch-22 seemed a brilliant evocation of everything we KNEW was wrong with authority, the govenment, war (read, Vietnam) and capitalism.  War was wasteful, individuals were largely pawns in a much bigger game, rapacious capitalists would deal with either or both sides to make a buck, and the underlying logic of the entire equation could only be described as \\""absurd,\\"" or, perhaps, a rational man could only grasp the world, and continue to function with his reason intact, if he came to appreciate absurdity.<br />I still believe Catch-22 brilliantly makes all of these points. I will never forget, for example, Milo Minderbinder's seemely bizarre schemes to make money for the \\""syndicate\\"" by cornering the market in cotton and trying to produce from it something edible, or contracting with the other side to bomb his own army. Similarly, the concept of Catch-22 (only a crazy man would want to fly more missions, and if you are crazy, we can't let you fly more missions; but you don't want to fly more missions, so you're not crazy, so you have to fly) has become a part of the language, though I'm not sure everyone who uses the term these days (fewer do) could explain its meaning or origin.  Finally, I love the idea that, because time seems to pass more quickly when you are bored, the best way to extend your life is to bore yourself unmercifully.<br />All of that being said, I do believe that many of the more negative reviews of the book result from our familiarity with so much of the political landscape of the book that, 40 years ago or more, seemed positively shocking, if not revolutionary.  Ours is not an especially revolutionary time, so Heller's absurdity, on the one hand, seems a bit out of step.  More than that, it is no longer new; we've heard it all before.  Reading Catch-22 now seeems a bit like listening to an overly long joke that we've heard too many times. Finally, it is hard for us to appreciate how unique the book seemed in the '60s and  70's as a critique of war, especially a critique of World War II--the Last Good War of the Great Generation.  Before Heller, the literature coming out of WWII, despite depictions of avarice or cruelty or waste, had none the less esteemed that war as a great and good thing that, in pertinant part, overthrew an evil dictator and freed (part of) Europe, etc.  It was shocking to see THAT war depicted in THIS way.<br />I only came to indulge in this review because, recently, I thought I would re-read the book. I was hoping I would find it fresh and funny and insightful (as I remembered it).  I was disappointed. It was still occasionally funny and made many of the points I remembered. But the disjointed nature of the narrative seemed confusing and indulgent, whereas I remembered it as groundbreaking.  And much of the book left me rather cold. It seemed long-winded, and repetitive (because we really did get the point), and many of the characters seem as if they are there only to set up a joke or make a point and they are not especially real or multidimensional.<br />In any case, I would still recommend reading the book. Like many \\""popular\\"" or \\""political\\"" books, however, to really appreciate it requires casting your mind back to a different time and looking at it from that perspective. Without doing so, it is hard to realize how unique and deservedly influential the book was.  On the other hand, if you cannot or will not approach the book from that perspective (and it is certainly no sin if you cannot), I'm afraid a new reader will find himself agreeing with the more negative reviews on this site.  That seems a shame, even though I can hardly imagine Heller or any of his earliest readers contemplating that the book would ever be a historical curiosity or an expression of the mind-set of its day rather than a penetrating satire.realize how unique and deservedly influential the book was.

Joseph Heller has to be one of the greatest wits in literature history. The story of Yossarian the pilot who simply wants to live works on so many different levels. In the end the book transcends simply being comedy, it uses humor to pack a helluva moral punch that absolutely reduces the blindness of war, the slavish devotion to government to total ruin. By the end of the book the illogical nature of war is so clear that it's a wonder the UN hasn't declared war illegal and a crime. The dialogue is incredibly clever and the characters so unique and colorful. On of my favorite parts is the scene where General Dreedle at first wants the chaplain to hang out in the bar (\\""So that he can sympathize with the men and gain their trust. How else are they going to believe in God?\\"") but in the next breath says, \\""That's a fine thing, a man of God hanging out with a bunch of drunks and losers.\\"" And ends up threatening to have the chaplain taken outside and shot. Most of the humor fallows this same pattern, proving over and over again the illogical, contradictory, and insane nature of the military and of war. Or how about Milo and the syndacite? Milo plays both sides of every conflict and ends of funding an enemy bombing of his own batallion...There are better reviews on here and I could go on and on but this book literally blew me over with its powerful message and savagely satirical humor.",2010-09-15

After six months of maddeningly boring pre-deployment \\""training\\"", I had become somewhat scornful and skeptical of, not to mention endlessly disappointed, frustrated and disillusioned with, the military.  All of this had me extremely depressed.  During the few days of leave (just a few days; military policy is to give two weeks of leave, but we only got five days, and this is just one of the ways they screwed my unit over) between the end of the \\""training\\"" and the movement to Iraq, I went to visit my brother.  During the visit we happened to pass a bookstore, and he offered to buy me a copy of Catch-22.  He thought I might identify with it.  I replied that I was sure I would.  I'd heard of the book, of course, but never read it, and figured that if it was as ingeniously satirical as everyone said, reading it at that point in my life might just drive me over the edge.  I was afraid it would hit too close to home, and so I refused his generosity.  I went to Iraq, which turned out to be even more maddening than the \\""training\\"", stayed there for five months without incident, returned home and retired from the service just as soon as I could.  And then I read Catch-22.  As I was safely retired at that point, it didn't hit particularly close to home.  It's well-written, and very effective in making its point.  Unfortunately for me (and for any reader who has first-hand experience with the military) it's the most obvious point possible, and so most of the book's humor and absolutely all of its shock value are completely lost.    In many instances the book is simply too true to be funny.  There's hardly anything in it that didn't sound exactly like real life to me.

It is a brilliant satire on war in general which is set in Italy during the waning days of the Nazis in World War II. My one criticism of the book is that some jokes tend to get repetitive at times.    The story focuses mostly on a U.S. Air Force squadron who go on a number of bombing runs doing their best to stay alive and do many crazy things to avoid going on more bombing runs. At the center of the crazy group is Yossarian, a bombardier who is convinced that everyone is out to kill him. Despite actions such as appearing to receive a medal in the nude, in some ways he seems like one of the most sane in the group. His friends include Milo, a bombardier who, instead of flying missions, runs a syndicate which buys and sells almost any goods you can think of; his syndicate also provides services, which at one point included bombing his own squadron! The head of the outfit, Major Major, wants to be liked by the others but they treat him badly because of his position; consequently, he avoids people, only allowing people to be sent to his office when he isn't there. Even the higher-ups prove to be nutty with Generals Peckem and Dreedle spending their energy competing against each other rather than fighting the enemy.    The book shows how insane the military bureaucracy itself can be, embodied in the concept \\""catch-22\\"". One example of a catch-22 in the book is when Yossarian tries to be discharged by reason of insanity he's told he cannot be discharged because the fact he's trying to prove himself insane means that he isn't. Military silliness is also shown with how concerned officials are with seemingly unimportant things such winning parade contests and bombing a target so it makes for a nice photograph of the explosion.    Many characters come and go with several killed in combat. Heller makes all of them three-dimensional so you grow to either love or hate them. The writing contains a variety of humor - silly, intelligent, outrageous. There are several running jokes, though I feel sometimes they are overused, such as repeated explanations of how Milo's syndicate sells one kind of goods to one group in order to buy other kinds at all sorts of prices. In addition to the humorous moments, the book has examples of the horrors of war. Not everyone makes it home and nobody is the same afterward.

The leaders pay more attention to the quality of aerial bombing photographs than the actual bombing results.<br /><br />The M.D., counselor, and chaplain values each become subverted by their war duties.

Now I have finally got around to reading it and (unlike with Moby Dick) was not disappointed.<br /><br />The anti-hero, the anti-war sentiment and the black humor are all very characteristic of the 60s, especially 60s Britain, so it is not surprising that the novel was popular there before American readers warmed to it.  Unlike other anti-war works of the period however, this one was written by a veteran and based on hard experience, rather than - as was more usual at the time - by someone who had never experienced war and was determined never to do so.<br /><br />The movie versions of this and MASH were both released in 1970.  The latter was released first and was a much better movie, and so Catch-22 remained under the shadow of MASH for some time, and perhaps still does.  Readers familiar with the MASH movie and TV series, who read Catch-22 now, may not have the same sense of novelty that the early readers had.<br /><br />The events of the story are to some extent modeled on Homer's Iliad (and to a lesser extent The Odyssey) which Heller was reading at the time he wrote Catch-22.  It's not essential to know the Iliad in order to enjoy this story but, if you don't, you'll miss a lot of the references and not get the most out of it.  Having said that, there are plenty of other references - literary and mythological - and I'm sure I've not picked up anywhere near all of them in one reading.<br /><br />Interestingly, the title has become part of the language with a meaning that is not strictly reflected in the book.  Catch-22 as a 'no-win situation' is described early on, but the phrase recurs throughout with a more general meaning, that of an arbitrary and even fictitious rule.  As so often, the novel does not really say what people who have never read it think it does.<br /><br />The continual use of paradox - paradoxical judgments, contradictory statements and situations, and so on - can sometimes become too contrived and can sometimes fall flat.

Forget even the fact that it deals with war, it raises a lot of excellent points about life in general, through the satiric, repetitive, and absurd format and dialogue.  In life we notice that a lot of stupid and terrible things just happen, and they do all the time.     Life is repetitive, irritating, absurd, and bad things happen for no rhyme or reason, which is part of Snowden's secrect.  Of course, this is magnified 1000 times during war time.  Seemingly normal people do horrible things, like when Yossarian realizes that the true crazy person is actually Aarfy, who is so even keeled that he is incapable of grasping his own evil or true danger ahead.      This book illustrates some of the frustrating realities of living in a satirical and roundabout way, which is what makes it so brilliant.  If you can find the absurd, ridiculous, and awful in world war II, which was actually fought for excellent reaasons, you can find it in a hospital, a school system, a church, or an office.  Someone could probably write an amazing catch 22 style book about hurricane katrina and its aftermath.      The wild and colorful characters are really exaggerations of people you know and see every day.

I even know what it's like to be more nervous and scared when something bad isn't happening than when something bad is, like Hungry Joe having nightmares only when he isn't flying missions.

That is way better than, paraphrasing here, \\""There were many strange things happening. The strangest of all was the inexorable hatred of the Action Board. Clevinger was surprised to discover it.\\"" There are more examples of that throughout the book, and they are WAY longer than the one I provided.

Further, he abuses such tags as \\""He lied\\"" or \\""He questioned\\"", which gets repetitive.<br /><br />The plot? Was there even any plot? I could hardly distinguish one. Just random events happening. Also, the book tries to make itself like a movie by jumping around from character to character when it comes to certain things, something I hate. The names are stupid too- Major Major Major Major? Colonel Korn? I get that this book is meant to be a satire, but those names are just childish. Hell, even Family Guy is more creative with the names.<br /><br />Was the book funny? In some parts it was. I'll admit, the first three chapters are so absurdly funny, it's beautiful. And the ending was funny as well- I felt like someone had spiked my coffee with LSD by the time I got to the end.<br /><br />Lastly, the book's worst crime is that it's downright BORING. There's hardly any plot here, the characters, particularly Yossarian, are unlikeable and shallow, and the book is too long for its own good, yet simultaneously not long enough for the amount of stuff crammed in it.<br /><br />Overall, this book was incredibly frustrating to read.

Similar to the way that Catch-22 doubles back on itself, the book's dialogue is loaded with endless double entendres and a unique style of speaking I will call \\""catch talk.\\"" Many of the men, such as Yossarian, Orr, and Natalie all have conversation riddled with sexual innuendo. Catch talk most commonly occurs when Yossarian is present. When his commanding officers become furious with him and they attempt to punish him, Yossarian suggests that in order to avoid making the company look like it has insubordinate members the officers should simply promote him. The officers quickly write the idea off as ludicrous and continue trying to find a punishment for him. Soon, however, they realize on their own that punishing Yossarian would look bad for the company. Then one of the officers comes up with the brilliant plan to simply promote him and make the entire company forget about the issue. Thus, catch talk occurs. One party begins the argument arguing one way, and the talk then deviates to something different, but then reverts back to the original statement. This style of speaking catches the readers' attention and creates something unique that the reader can identify about the book.        Yossarian was one of the most original characters I have ever heard of. Playing the protagonist for a good portion of the book, he at times is also the antagonist, as he inhibits the goals of some of the other main characters. Similar to the looped idea of Catch-22, Yossarian can be quickly classified as one of the most insane people in the book (he curses himself for forgetting to bring his machine gun to the officer's club in order to massacre everyone). But on closer inspection, Yossarian is in fact one of the most sane people in the book. While all other officers act perfectly sane on the ground, they are considered insane because they ignore their instinct to survive in the air. Yossarian, on the other hand, acts insane while groundside but then is perfectly sane in the air. Everyone acts calm while flying, while Yossarian is panicky and wants nothing more than to get the hell out of the fight.        With its unique conversations and the one-of-a-kind Yossarian, Catch-22 was a hilarious and tragic adventure that gives a unique perspective on the war.",2010-01-22

In short, it's a double bind.<br /><br />The first Catch-22 ever publicized is, of course, to be found in this book.  Yossarian, the protagonist and a World War II bombardier, wants his squadron doctor to certify him insane so his superiors will ground him and he won't have to fly combat missions.  The doctor agrees that Yossarian is crazy, for a variety of reasons.  All that's lacking is for Yossarian to ask to be grounded.  If he does that, however, the doctor is required to take that as a sign that he has a normal, healthy aversion to being shot at, that he is therefore sane, and that he must therefore fly more combat missions.  Oops.<br /><br />This is far from the first or last such incidence of utter lunacy in this book.  The chaos begins well before the story kicks off.  It actually starts at the author's note, which states that the real island of Pianosa lies in the Mediterranean off the Italian coast and is far too small to accommodate all the incidents set there in \\""Catch-22\\"".  So you start reading, with the idea in mind that the story on paper is, if anything, less real than other books, and the activities of the characters seem to bear you out - for instance, within the first few pages the narrative describes a captain with whom Yossarian has stopped playing chess because the captain is a good chess player, and the games are therefore so interesting they are foolish.  And you think \\""Aha, this is a farce\\"".  Then Chapter 2 starts with the line \\""Outside, there was still nothing funny going on,\\"" and you remember that Yossarian and his buddies are in imminent danger of death every day.  Farce, my foot.<br /><br />Joseph Heller had a real gift for the goofy detail - he could have written sketches for Monty Python - and it was a stroke of genius for him to set his first novel during World War II, because the pressures of wartime prevent the story from dissolving into a set of disconnected episodes.  The author came up with a few other strategies to lend his story a framework, most particularly Yossarian's recurring recollection of what happened in his plane to a young gunner named Snowden.  In speaking of this incident, he generally turns it into a bad joke, asking \\""Where are the Snowdens of yesteryear?\\"" during mission briefings whenever someone asks if there are any questions.  The question is a riff on the refrain of a poem by the medieval French poet Villon - \\""Where are the snows of yesteryear?\\"" - the verses of which seem to be about the loss of beauty and love, or maybe innocence.  As for Yossarian's question, when you find out what happened to Snowden, you learn that Yossarian isn't quite as nuts as you might think.  Let's just say that his question has to do with lost innocence also, and let it go at that.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, you can read all of \\""Catch-22\\"" as a series of confrontations between innocence and whatever seeks to destroy it, another good reason for setting it in wartime.  This probably explains why there are so few combat scenes in the novel, and maybe why this is an air unit rather than a ground unit.  It allows Heller to tell his story at one remove from genuine blood and death, at least until the novel's climax, and concentrate on the conflict between the innocent and the cynical.  Yossarian makes a good central character because he's almost the only one who finds a way to fight the cynics around him without becoming cynical himself.  It doesn't work forever, but it keeps Yossarian out of the snake pit long enough to learn another strategy from a most unlikely supporting character, and that's how \\""Catch-22\\"" manages to end in some sort of triumph.<br /><br />So that's one possible reading of this ridiculous story - ridiculous on its face, that is.  You can also read it as an attack on postwar bureaucracy a la Kafka's \\""The Trial\\"", or some kind of anti-imperialist manifesto, or I don't know what, but please don't forget that it's also a comedy of manners, however unlikely that sounds.  And just to give you an idea of how lightly you can take this book, we know that the phrase \\""Catch-22\\"" is pretty nearly random.  Joseph Heller wanted to call it \\""Catch-18\\"", but his publisher made him change the number to avoid confusion with the contemporary bestseller \\""Mila 18\\"", and he picked one that sounded euphonious to him.  That's how much heavy significance there is to this novel - first and foremost, it's meant to be funny, and it succeeds exceptionally well.<br /><br />Joseph Heller gave an interview once in which he envisioned Buck Henry, who wrote the movie screenplay, flipping through \\""Catch-22\\"" in despair and moaning \\""There's no PLOT here!\\""  Technically speaking, that's probably true, but it doesn't matter.  Its structure and theme make this novel hang together more than well enough.  As we follow Yossarian from his desire to avoid combat by simply refusing to cooperate (following in the footsteps of his great predecessor, the Good Soldier Svejk), to his desperate attempt at keeping his sanity and his moral compass while tied hand and foot by the last great Catch-22, we come to realize that like a lot of light farces, this one has some pretty deep roots.

I was very disappointed with it because it's widely hailed as a great and 'hilarious' work of classic fiction and I saw it as exactly the opposite.    Once again, as with many books I've read, the foreword wasn't really worth reading. It should have been an afterword because it basically described the process of getting the book published along with all the successes and obstacles therein. As with almost every foreword, it contained some amount of spoilers which dismayed me because I prefer to find such things out myself. Those curious about the history behind the book or folks who have read the book before and bought the new copy would find it useful.  After reading the first three chapters, I was wondering when the book would begin to be funny and enthralling. I was constantly confused about what was happening and most of the \\""Jokes\\"" fell flat. The book is intentionally written in a manner that makes the reader dig deep to link events together, which I personally didn't care for. I felt like I was watching \\""Lost\\"" by the way everything was spread out and the beginning of the book in particular offers tiny pieces of the plot through seemingly incongruous events.  As I tried to get into the book, I developed a strong distaste for the writing style and I had to force myself through this book most of the time. There were only a few parts that I found funny, but I was mostly disappointed by the real lack of any climactic action whatsoever. The reviews I had read about this book had me expecting a hilarious thrill ride but it's almost half dialogue apart from tons of unnecessary descriptions and a smattering of fistfights and actual combat.    I think that Heller's sense of humor was lost on me. This book is a riot if you love reading the same thing over and over again. When the reader isn't trying to figure out which character is terrified about which or waiting to find the significance of an event, the dialogue drones on and the paradoxes and contradictions that make the heart of the book pop up incessantly and contribute absolutely nothing to the story. I did find some parts funny, but those parts were far too few to be redeeming. I do not consider this book to be especially funny, and I do not think that the humor of the book should be mentioned in most of the quotes and synopses on the back cover or in the Amazon.com description. I could see it being a bit better in movie format because of how important the tone and delivery of the dialogue is, but I have not seen the film nor do I intend to. If you disagree with my sentiment, then take into consideration that I found the Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger to be the funniest novel I've ever read and blame my sense of humor for that.    The characters were pretty well developed, and with all the description the reader knows about every freckle or wart on their faces. Some of them were funny or surprising at first, but the way every person is involved in nearly every event makes juggling all the names and facts exhausting at first. As the story goes on and the plotline jumps wildly around, I think that some readers would have to have a pen and paper ready to take notes as things progress tiny bits at a time while the focus is on a different subject. Luckily, everything is restated several times and if you missed anything the first time, you're sure to see it pop up again and again.   I think that the main reason why I didn't like this book was the fact that in reading through it I had effectively read the same thing twice, if not several times with all the repetition. The secondary reason is that my expectations of this book were simply too high and I didn't appreciate the way life and death were so inconsequential, and insignificant events and errors were blown out of proportion. I understand that the book is meant to be partly satirical about the military and about that very portrayal of such skewed priorities,but such a piece of writing is simply not for me. I don't feel that this book is deserved at all of its reputation and I would never consider buying the sequel or recommending it to a friend.  I saw fit to rate it two stars because it is not entirely without good qualities, but I couldn't help but wonder why the book couldn't have been written in chronological order. I suppose that that quality is part of the charm, but I would have preferred a less repetitive book.",2009-12-30

So it was with some trepidation that I cracked it back open as an adult. Would it hold up? Thankfully, it did more than hold up; it turns out that it's even better than I remember. It's not just Heller's brilliant, through the looking glass logic that makes Catch-22 so remarkable, even though that logic leads to innumerable laugh-out-loud hilarious passages and too many brilliant sequences to count (my personal favorite may always be the sudden moaning outbreak). Had the book merely been a brilliant and hilarious piece of satire, I would have enjoyed it, but it wouldn't be the classic that it is. What makes Catch-22 absolutely unforgettable is the deep layer of melancholy and rage that underlies the satire and drives the book. I've always held that one of the hardest things to do in any medium is mix genres, and I'm always impressed when someone does it well. In Catch-22, Heller mixes drama, comedy, romance, and war story together without even blinking, and slides so effortlessly between them that you go from laughing to horror in the blink of an eye. It's this juxtapositioning that gives the book so much of its power - the transition, for instance, from Yossarian's insane arguing with Danby to the horrific fate of poor, doomed Snowden remains one of the most effective and haunting passages of any book I have ever read. There has never been another book like Catch-22 - even Heller never wrote anything this brilliant again (although Something Happened is a minor gem of an altogether different sort). But given how incredible this book is - how funny, how touching, how haunting, how powerful, how brilliant - who can complain? With its spectacular and wonderful set of characters, its trenchant and hilarious take on the military mind, and Heller's masterful writing, Catch-22 remains the finest book I have ever read.",2009-12-13

I needn't have been concerned.    Catch 22 is a classic novel, combining many disparate elements ... slapstick, biting sarcasm, tragedy, the darkest of black humor ... into something larger than the sum of its parts.  The story follows Army Air Corps Captain John Yossarian, a bombadier in a B-25 bomber in Italy.  Yossarian and his fellow pilots have been pushed well beyond their limits of endurance by an incompetent and uncaring superior, and Yossarian has lost his nerve to continue fighting, along with maybe a large part of his sanity.  He desperately trys to avoid flying any more combat missions, but the military bureaucracy always manages to stay one step ahead of him.

They say you should write what you know, and like his character Yossarian, Mr. Heller was a B-25 Bombadier in Italy, where he flew 60 combat missions.

It's plagued with horrible, repetitive dialog and ridiculous characters (that I guess is supposed to be humorous) that makes you want to skip to the last chapter to see how this abomination of the English language ends.

And even if the message of a book hasn't aged well, that doesn't make the book bad. An example of this would be Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut, another satire that takes place in WWII. Again, the message is a bit dated, but at least that book is well written and entertaining. Not only that, but the message is supported by a first-hand account of the bombing of Dresden, one of the most horrible events of the war in Europe. In Catch-22, the anti-war messageis backed up by five hundred pages of a lazy air-force captain complaining.     So overall, this book is garbage.       *Warning. Contains spoilers*    And just one more thing, I hate the ending. He decides that he won't endorse a statement that the pilots need to fly eighty missions in exchange for a trip home because it puts his fellow pilots in danger.

It is hilarious, absurd, shocking, disturbing, and one hell of a ride.  I can understand why it holds such a place of high esteem in the canon of 20th Century Literature.  The story revolves around John Yossarian, an American bombardier stationed on the island of Pianosa, in the Mediterranean, during World War II. Yossarian no longer wants to fly missions, and attempts to find a way to get out of further bombing runs.  The problem is catch-22, the unwritten, unofficial rule that states that an insane crewman can be grounded from missions, and a man who willingly continues to fly combat missions must be insane.  However, if he makes the necessary formal request to stop flying such missions, the very act of filing the request proves that he is sane and, therefore, is ineligible to be grounded.  Caught on this bureaucratic hook, Yossarian keeps flying missions while Colonel Cathcart, the squadron commander, keeps raising the number of missions the men must fly before they can go home.  This is one of many bureaucratic absurdities that Yossarian encounters, and the ridiculousness of bureaucracy in war is one of the major themes in this book.<br /><br />Bureaucracy can create a unique type of madness in war.  Trivialities (such as clerical errors) grow to be of extreme importance, while critical matters (matters of life and death) are marginalized.  Soldiers are marched off to their doom with a false sense of duty, bravado, and patriotism, worrying about trivial matters, while giving no thought to survival.  Yossarian labels this for what it is - insanity - and decides that to survive in an insane world, one must become insane.  His insane survival techniques lead to some truly enlightening moments of lunacy, which are quite fun.<br /><br />The first half of \\""Catch 22\\"" is biting, satirical, and has some truly hilarious moments.  Heller uses slapstick humor and situations to get across the esprit de corps that soldiers in combat share.  However, as the story progresses, it suddenly spirals from the comically absurd to the brutally cruel and irrational.  In the last few chapters, the story takes a steep emotional drop that catches the reader by surprise, dragging them off a cliff into a dark emotional abyss.  The story's sudden and abrupt turns to the cruelty, inhumanity, and unfairness of war is done in an understated manner which amplifies the irrationality of the situation.  The reader comes away feeling the anguish and despair that Yossarian feels as his friends die, disappear, or commit atrocities abhorrent to Yossarian.<br /><br />Heller does an excellent job of communicating the inhumanity of war and the madness of bureaucracy in war.  He shows that a bureaucracy, ran by cruel or insane men, can utterly destroy the rights of an individual, sometimes with the passive or active assistance of the individual themselves.  The circular, non-linear story line is a little off-putting, but it allows for the reader to view situations from several different points of view which gives enhanced breadth and depth to the story..

One shows senior officers who are comically unsympathetic to the interests of their men. Some of these, such as Colonel Cathcart and General Peckem, are careerists who make decisions according to self-interest (or stupidity and self-interest). Others are incompetents, such as Major Major Major Major and General Sheiskopff, whose authority far surpasses their ability. To me, the careerist officers, while satirical, seemed as real as any modern bungling boss, working smugly in the corner office.<br /><br />Milo Minderbinder, a genius trader and capitalist, is the dominant character in the second narrative. Technically, Milo is the mess officer at Pianosa, where Yossarian is based. But he has parlayed this job into a food supply syndicate and has become a major commercial player throughout the entire war zone. Milo is a profiteer and entrepreneur whose greed distorts, and sometimes overshadows, the war.<br /><br />With Milo, Heller shows a world of surrealistic capitalism that thrives as the men in the bombers die. But for me, Milo didn't add much. His adventures make twisted sense. Yet they hit only one note and don't really ripen into something more profound.  Milo is the least successful part of this superior and complex book.<br /><br />The third narrative in CATCH-22 shows the men who fly in the bombers. Here, Heller's work is outstanding. There are men who can't shake the presence of death (Yossarian, Dunbar, Hungry Joe, and Dobbs). There are true believers who accept the mission and its risks (Clevinger and Havermeyer). There is a rich kid (Nately), a reckless hotdog (McWatt), and a doomed alcoholic (Chief White Halfoat). And there are the horrible fatalities (Snowden and Kid Sampson), whose deaths are gruesome and arbitrary.<br /><br />Heller's work with these characters is absolutely first-rate. While they have cartoonish aspects, each is distinct and each has a surprisingly moving story. Heller also writes about their combat missions with you-are-there intensity.

It's definitely a book I plan to hold onto and enjoy re-reading every year.    Anyone who's ever worked for a big corporation (like myself) can identify with Heller's hilarious and angry take on bureaucracy. Gen.

He's brutally honest about the horrors of war, and laces them with enough humanity to really break your heart. It all makes the climatic \\""miracle\\"" that much more satisfying. It's a satire that ends with a message of hope. And I like that.    Many people call this book ant-war, but I don't think it is. It really comes down to the last conversation btw.

The title refers to a military rule in the book in which circular logic is employed to keep air-men flying their missions, despite their best efforts to avoid them.  It illustrates perfectly the message of the story: war is insane, and inane bureaucratic operation sustains it.    I began reading the novel with optimistic expectations, mainly from the critical acclaim it has received over the decades, but also because the title's concept seemed a clever premise for a novel.  However, as I read chapter after chapter I became disheartened.  The jokes were not funny, they made no sense, and the characters rambled on insanely about seemingly unimportant topics.  By about page 100 I was seriously considering moving on to something else, but then a colleague of mine saw it in my hand and said, \\""Catch-22, great novel, isn't it?\\""  This guy was highly-educated and a veteran educator - was I missing something?  \\""Actually,\\"" I replied, \\""I'm not really getting into this one.\\""  He smiled and nodded knowingly: \\""It took me five tries to finish it.  The first hundred pages are tough, but once you get over that stretch it's really worth it.\\""  Taking him at his word I trudged on, and I am deeply grateful I did.  He was correct, as the story gradually began to come together brilliantly and by the end I decided that it was perhaps one of the most solid and intelligent novels that I have yet read.    There were reasons for my troubles, and I fear that many give up with a sour impression of the book due to them.  The novel is told from differing points of view, and the story is nonlinear.  Events are told repeatedly by different people, often out of sequence, and are revealed more and more in their entirety each time further details are offered.  This results in the completion of a set-up to a joke whose punch-line has already been told.  It allows the reader to laugh at and understand later a situation which previously seemed frivolous and unfunny.  It also changes one's perspective of characters that at first seemed insane, but are later found to be the sanest.    Catch-22 offers many instances of poignant insight and telling observations.  One of the most relevant to our own time involves a conversation between the American character Nately and an elderly Italian man:     \\""You put so much stock in winning wars,\\"" the grubby iniquitous old man scoffed.  \\""The real trick lies in losing wars, in knowing which wars can be lost.  Italy has been losing wars for centuries,  and just see how splendidly we've done nonetheless.  France wins wars and is in a continual  state of crisis.  Germany loses and prospers.\\"" (Heller 255)    And later...     \\""There is nothing so absurd about risking your life for your country,\\"" he [Nately] declared.   \\""Isn't there?\\"" asked the old man.  \\""What is a country?  A country is a piece of land surrounded on all sides by boundaries, usually unnatural.  Englishmen are dying for England, Americans are dying for America, Germans are dying for Germany, Russians are dying for Russia.  There are now fifty or sixty countries fighting in this war.  Surely so many countries can't be worth dying for.\\""   \\""Anything worth living for,\\"" said Nately, \\""is worth dying for.\\""   \\""And anything worth dying for,\\"" answered the sacrilegious old man, \\""is certainly worth living for... How old are you?  Twenty-five?  Twenty-six?\\""   \\""Nineteen,\\"" said Nately, \\""I'll be twenty in January.\\""   \\""If you live.\\"" (Heller 257)    Despite what justifications can be made for war, how else can war look to one who witnesses the carnage first-hand but to be absolutely without reason?  And though certain wars may be just, certainly not all battles are.  This is the experience of Yossarian.    The novel contains the heart-breaking reality of war coupled with the zaniness of people on the brink of sanity's edge.  It is real enough to be relevant, but surreal enough for the reader to laugh and enjoy without qualms of conscience.  For those who have been inhibited by the confusion of the first hundred pages of the book, I beg you to return once more for the long haul.  The journey is well-worth it.",2008-01-18

Chronicling bombardier pilot John Yossarian's years in World War Two Italy, on the fictional island of Pianosa, the story brutally satirizes war, politics, and a myriad of human flaws.  Heller blends a deep and complex narrative with sharp, intelligent humor to create a classic as thoroughly enjoyable as it is intellectually rewarding.  Catch-22 is a must-read, one of the very finest pieces of twentieth century American literature.   The story begins with Yossarian lying in a hospital bed, feigning liver disease in order to avoid flying on potentially deadly bombing raids.  He is charged there with censoring the letters sent between soldiers and their loved ones at home and amuses himself by altering the letters in creative ways, often completely changing their meanings.  Already the army bureaucracy is criticized, both for its questionable intentions in having the letters censored at all, and for allowing Yossarian to ruin them.  Soon a new patient check into Yossarian's ward, a Texan.  He \\""turned out to be good-natured, generous, and likeable.  In three days nobody could stand him.\\""  The patients' reaction to their amiable fellow sets the stage for a story full of such paradoxes and ironies.  At the heart of the confusion in this instance is the Texan's extreme patriotism.  The veteran soldiers in the room have become disillusioned with concepts like patriotism and honor and are repulsed by the Texan's reflection of their former naiveté.  As each soldier miraculously recovers and returns to duty, we laugh at the absurdity of their overreaction, but we also wonder at the idea of being so repulsed by an ostensibly good quality like patriotism.   The entire episode in the hospital, during which many important characters are introduced and recurring plot elements are brought into the narrative, is over in a few pages.  Heller's writing is dense, but reads quickly and smoothly, so much so that readers who revisit a chapter, particularly after finishing the book, will find much more there than the first reading uncovered.  In fact, Catch-22 practically mandates re-reading, as the story is often told out-of-order, from frequently changing viewpoints, and with crucial information revealed only after it is needed.  Though Yossarian is the book's central character, each chapter brings a new soldier, officer, or civilian into the spotlight, exploring events from his or her perspective as contrasted with Yossarian's relatively sane view.   The first character to receive this treatment is Clevinger.  Unlike most of the book's military characters, Clevinger is intelligent, well educated, and highly principled.  His unfailing optimism is frequently contrasted with Yossarian's outright pessimism.  Almost immediately after his introduction, Clevinger has tries to change Yossarian's dark outlook.  \\""They're trying to kill me,\\"" Yossarian told him calmly.  \\""No one's trying to kill you,\\"" Clevinger cried.  \\""Then why are they shooting at me?\\"" Yossarian asked.  \\""They're shooting at everyone,\\"" Clevinger answered. \\""They're trying to kill everyone.\\""  \\""And what difference does that make?\\""  Both men make perfectly rational arguments, and both truly believe their words, and yet they couldn't agree more.  Unfortunately for Clevinger, fate seems to prove Yossarian right.  Not long after their exchange, Clevinger is put on trial in military court, apparently for no other crime than being \\""smart,\\"" (and therefore a threat).  The trial is perfectly absurd, and hilarious.  A bellicose colonel demands to know the exact time at which Clevinger didn't deny his guilt, but refuses to tell him with what crime he is being charged.  After much confused suttering, Clevinger exasperatedly admits \\""I always didn't say you couldn't find me guilty!\\"" The colonel, finally appeased, says \\""That's much better, Mr Clevinger.\\""  The trial is side-splitting, but its implied accusations are frightening.  The blatant injustice in the military court goes entirely unquestioned by all but the accused.  Not a soul questions the court's completely invalid logic or its motivations in attacking one of the most sincerely good men in the camp without cause.  Yossarian's belief that the world conspires against the sane seems entirely justified as Clevinger searches desperately for some truth to hold onto, still unwilling to believe that Yossarian's worst fears might have been realized.  Yossarian begins to devote himself entirely to escaping the war when his squadron's commander, Colonel Cathcart, develops a habit of lengthening his men's tours of duty whenever one nears completion.  By raising the number of missions required of each man, he hopes to develop the best squad in the army and get promoted to general, but his absurd rule effectively pronounces a death sentence upon his men.  Yossarian in particular is horrified, but struggles to find any way around Cathcart in the military's virtual dictatorship of insane and incompetent men.  As the story progresses, Catch-22 darkens as Heller focuses on the facts of war and death.  Everything Yossarian sees in Pianosa convinces him further that his own countrymen are out to kill him.  The war becomes less and less of a reality as the men of the base gain a sense of the war's futility and the inevitability of their deaths.  While Heller's sharp wit remains about him, it focuses more on true insanity than the quirks and character flaws that originally defined his characters.  Each man on the island has his own battle with death and must decide what he believes, yet none of them can change the realities of their situation.  As death looms over the island, each man reacts differently, but always in extreme and exaggerated ways.  Many go into denial about their fates; others go mad trying to escape their combat duties.  Yossarian grows distrustful of everybody and tries one desperate escape after another, obsessed with saving himself.  Each character's fate has far reaching implications and serves to advance Heller's anti-war and anti bureaucracy crusade, but it is the result of Yossarian's quest for sanity that writes the final words on war, death, and sanity itself.",2007-07-24

And yet, the only person who can see all of this is Yossarian, a bombardier who has the misfortune to be stuck in a war while being, as the dust-jacket points out, \\""dangerously sane.\\""  He is terrified by the dangers that surround him, disgusted by the wanton behavior of his compatriots, and angered by the selfishness of his superiors.  He just wants to go home and leave all this behind him, but that seems to be an impossible dream.  The closer he gets to the end of his tour, the further he gets from going home as power-hungry, image conscious superiors concoct new ways to extend the number of missions their pilots must fly.  This is a war where the accuracy of a bombing run is seen as irrelevant so long as it photographs well (a pretty explosion is all part of the CO's PR campaign), a mess hall officer can run an international business that makes him the most powerful man in the unit, and a dead body can be allowed to lie around without getting removed if that officer's paperwork never arrived (making him never officially exist to the bureaucrats), and more.  The logic that they and all characters except Yossarian use is utterly absurd, lending \\""Catch-22\\"" a farcical air, but the genius of Heller's work is that their outrageous logic is actually an only mildly exaggerated version of the logic that we are forced to abide by in everyday life.

The commonest kind of trouble is that it is nearly reasonable, but not quite.\\"" G. K Chesterton.<br /><br />*<br /><br />This book's one flaw is that it neglects a discussion of the concentration camps.  But more on that later. . . .<br /><br />Catch-22 is classic absurdist literature, focusing on bureaucrat's circular reasoning and double-binds.  Although the story set in WWII Italy, anyone who has had to deal with hierarchy and bureaucracy--be it the military, college, the DMV, or the Board of Deacons--will resonates with the ideas expressed herein.<br /><br />It is the American equivalent of \\""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\\"" In style, Heller is a mixture of Douglas Adams and Dave Berry.  He has the same with and the same dead-eye for human foibles, and the cumulative effect of compound incompetence.  This is not a \\""Greatest Generation\\""-type book.<br /><br />I found the first third of the book fresh, with the mixture of absurdist and repetitive humor, the stream of thought, and mid-sentence scene changes.  Heller's style gives the book not so much a dreamlike feel, but more of a surrealistic flow to the events.  It reminds me of the old classic \\""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.\\""<br /><br />However, the second third of the book was tedious. The novel humor deteriorated into a gimmick, and a series of stream-of-thought gags.  The repetitive humor therefore became redundant.  I got the point that things were weird, but the humor-mechanism was overused.<br /><br />The last third got interesting as Heller stopped focusing on absurdist gags, and began focusing on the narrative.  This book has a large cast of charters, and it is a fitting tribute to Heller that he keeps track of the mob, and is able to keep us interested in their lives and in the situations.<br /><br />What surprised me the second-most was that this book is definitely a seed-source for M*A*S*H.  The most famous moments such as Hawkeye streaking, or his mental breakdown all have their roots in this book.  What is that quote about flattery?<br /><br />What surprised me the most was the hidden religious aspect. The book's opening lines are: \\""It was love at first sight.  The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.\\""  The chaplain serves as a pontiff, the unit's bridge between man and God. And Yossarian's relationship with the pontiff is one of love.<br /><br />Brilliantly, Heller drops the subject and goes on with the narrative.  However the religious ideas keep cropping up.  Chapter 18 has a discussion of God by two atheists.  I think the statement by Lt. Scheisskopf's Wife on page 180 is a classic example of someone trying to have their cake and eat it, too.  Chapter 25 is devoted to the Chaplain's doubts--which leased me to wonder why Heller wants the character to be this way.  Then there is the ironically titled of Chapter 39, \\""The Eternal City.\\""  So religion is clearly a leitmotif, but it also serves as book-ends to the story.<br /><br />The story (and Heller's sequel), focuses on Yossarian's and Milo's relationship.  Yossarian is the rebel and outsider--even outlaw--of the system, while Milo's assimilates and takes advantage of the system.  But as the incident with Snowden and the missing morphine illustrates, the assimilation backfires.<br /><br />So it is the death of a comrade, the unnecessary death due to the war profiteering system, that forces Yossarian to have a change of heart, and reject the sub-word of the black market.  This is the essential Christian message of the Atonement.<br /><br />This incident forces Yossarian to shift loyalties from Milo and the conniving Generals to the Chaplain. This is an odd realignment, considering that in Chapter 36, the Chaplain Christically suffers for Yossarian horseplay in signing the letters \\""Washington Irving.\\""<br /><br />Once again, we have these Christic moments is this grim and gritty tale of the Other Side of the Greatest Generation.

While this didn't cause me distress or confusion (in fact I've found this technique appealing in many other novels - including pretty much everything Kurt Vonnegut has ever written) but in this case I found the story moved aimlessly, consisting of little more than a series of loosely bound (albeit, amusing) antidotes. Amusing anecdotes are not a bad thing, but for me, there was no sense that the chapters were building toward anything. The story didn't feel like it was moving forward. As a result, my interest waned (despite the fact that the individual chapters were often entertaining) and it took some measure of discipline for me not to put this book down and move on.<br /><br />My complaint about the lack of forward-moving plot is the primary reason for my middling review(a mere 3 stars for this highly acclaimed novel), but it isn't my only complaint. Another is the lack of likeable characters.

Another key idea at the crux of the novel is time. One of the reasons that I was able to enjoy reading the novel after already having read it before was the complex chronological structure.

Rather, time is jumbled in a mess, which enhances the entire effect of life under Catch 22: and confusing, helpless mess.    The novel is also held together by black humour. Heller pokes fun at many areas in the microcosmic story that are inherently not funny at all.

Probably one of the great 20th century classics in war literature along with \\""Farewell to Arms\\"" and \\""All Quiet on the Western Front\\"", this is the ultimate tragi-comedy of WW2.  Based on the life of a group of bomber pilots based in Italy; the story focuses on Yosarian, and his group of buddies who do their best to survive the war, execute their missions, avoid their commanding officers, lay with hot nurses and escape vengeful widows of slain comrades.  As the war progresses and their comrades are killed in bunches and spurts, the remainder find various ways to cope with the emotional loss and the inevitable sense of doom.  They all want to go home alive; but the only way to go home alive is to fly a required number of bombing runs.  But each bombing run exposes you to death from enemy fire.  So here is the catch; fly your runs as quick as possible, hope you survive each one, so you can go home after the last one.  Or, try to postpone each flight you have to take knowing that you will live longer in the short run, but also knowing that you eventually will have to fly them.  The risk with the latter is that you might also get killed in other ways on the ground; example is Yosarian's friend - Hungry Joe who suffocates to death in his sleep because a cat slept on his face.  In between the author shows in funny detail the life of soldiers, and those civilians who have to put up with them.

Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is in a category all by itself.  This laugh-out-loud tale of an American bombardier during the second half of World War II redefines what a novel can be.  Yossarian's tale leads you through a series of encounters with numerous characters which include the craziest of the crazy, sanest of the sane, and even a Major named Major who bears a slight resemblance to Henry Fonda.  Heller gives you a hilarious commentary of sinister bureaucratic rule that is no less than marvelous. <br /> The book takes place on the island of Pianosa (Pianosa is a real island, but Heller has taken the liberty to make it much larger for the sake of his novel) that sits off of the coast of Italy.   Yossarian's main goal throughout the novel is to stay alive, or die trying.  He is puzzled by the fact that millions of people that he doesn't even know yet want to kill him.  His only hope is to be grounded, but the only man who has the power to do so, Doc Daneeka, refuses.  Backing the doctor up in his assertion is Catch-22.  <br />\\""There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind.  Orr was crazy and could be grounded.  All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions.  Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them.  If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to.  Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.  `That's some catch that catch 22,' he observed.  `It's the best there is.' Doc Daneeka agreed.\\""(46)  The concept of Catch-22 is an ever present theme, and its circular path of logic is referred to time and time again. <br />Joseph Heller does a wonderful job exposing the corruption in our society.  We are graced with flashbacks within flashbacks, followed up with flash forwards and even more flashbacks.  This highly illogical order of events could have spelled disaster.  In the hands of a lesser author this hilariously satirical piece could have turned into a jumbled mess, but Heller commands the stream of consciousness in a manner that can only be described as genius.  The events and stories don't fall into place until the end of the novel, at which point the fog is lifted and everything becomes clear.  The circular logic of the Catch-22 is even apparent in his writing technique.  \\""The Texan turned out to be good-natured, generous and likeable.  In three days no one could stand him.\\""(9)  Upon closer examination of the novel one can see that Catch-22 is a very serious piece of literature.  Heller uses our sense of humor to expose us to a grotesquely cruel world with a blatant disregard for human life.  A world not all that different from our own, shown through rose colored glasses, distorted just enough to miraculously provide us with a clearer picture.  Through Yossarian's fight to survive, he seems to be un-patriotic by your grandfather's standards, but the tenacity in which he fights for what he truly wants he provides with a sick twisted role model.  His ideals add to the corruptness of those around him.  \\""`What would they do to me,' he asked in confidential tones, `if I refused to fly them?'  `We'd probably shoot you,' ex-PFC. Wintergreen replied.  `We?' Yossarian cried in surprise. `What do you mean, we?  Since when are you on their side?'  `If you're going to be shot, whose side do you expect me to be on?' ex-PFC. Wintergreen retorted.\\""(59)  As the plot continues to unfold, Heller provides you with a government that grows increasingly more evil.  The complexity of the order of events keeps you glued to the text, if for no other reason than to be able to understand where Heller is heading with this story.  As a reader we are provided with a surprise ending which in turn explains everything. <br />All in all Catch-22 is a literary masterpiece.  It flirts dangerously with the line between humor and absolute horror.  In a world infatuated by cruelty, inhumanity, and absolute carnage, Heller provides us with a new look on an old idea, the morality of refusal.  In not accepting the rules associated with Catch-22, Yossarian is able to rise above the cruel world that he is a part of and gives us hope when all is thought to be lost.  Catch-22 is a must read staple of contemporary literature, a masterpiece of its time. <br />",2006-03-31

The book revolves around one catch, Catch-22, which states, \\""a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he formally requests to be relieved proves that he is sane and cannot be relieved\\"" (45).  The catch changes meanings several times throughout the novel; but always clearly conveys the satirical tone of Heller's work.  <br /> <br />Heller, a bombardier during World War II himself, begins his novel with the main character, Yossarian, in the hospital.  He had vowed not to fly any more combat missions.  Readers are introduced to a variety of other characters: Orr, Yossarian's roommate; Clevinger, Dunbar, Havermeyer, other bombardiers; Doc Daneeka; Hungary Joe; Major Major, and many more.  Each chapter focuses on a different character.  The novel follows Yossarian on his combat missions, leaves in Rome, and stays in the hospital.  Throughout, readers are told of Yossarian's fear. <br /> <br />Heller's Catch-22 is worth the time to read.  Heller clearly conveys the feeling bombardiers have during their combat missions.   <br />   <br />   \\""There was no established procedure for evasive action.  All you needed was fear, and Yossarian had plenty of that, more fear than Orr or Hungry Joe, more fear even than Dunbar, who had resigned himself submissively to the idea that he must die someday. Yossarian had not resigned himself to that idea, and he bolted for his life wildly on each mission the instant his bombs were away\\"" (50). <br /> <br />Seeing the machinery that could kill you at any second would take many hours of mental conditioning just being able to remain calm.  No one would be able to get used to the flak.  In a way the catch states that as long as soldier possesses fear, he is sane. <br /> <br />Heller uses a disrupted stream of consciousness to help create his tone.  The novel covershuge leaps of time.  At one moment, the novel will be before a mission called Avignon, but suddenly will be right after Ferrara, a mission that happened long before Avignon.  What one comes to realize is that the chronological order does not matter.  The novel is more about the fear felt by the men and the different ways each man copes with fear.  More importantly are the repeated images and concepts. <br /> <br />Yossarian's fear never ends, which is why some of the imagines and concepts are repeated.  One such image is the soldier in white.  When Yossarian was in the hospital, a soldier was brought in during the night that had a complete body cast on.  He later died of his injuries.  As Yossarian's fear is always with him, so is the memory of the soldier in white.  Yossarian could easily picture himself as having \\""two useless legs and two useless arms\\"" (10).  Yossarian did not appreciate the reminder of what could happen to him on any of his missions.  Another repeated concept is the namesake of the novel, Catch-22.  Catch-22 changes meanings throughout the novel.  For Yossarian and the men, the meaning has already been stated.  For the citizens of Rome, a city occupied by American troops, \\"" `Catch-22 says they have a right to do anything we can't stop them from doing' \\"" (407).  Troops could evict people from their homes or force a restaurant to close and the Italians had to follow the orders, only because they could not stop the troops.  What the men are afraid of changes for each man, but they are all afraid.  Hungary Joe is afraid of going stateside, Nately of losing his beloved whore, and Yossarian of losing his life.  Many repetitions appear in Heller's Catch-22, these are just two examples.   <br /> <br />Heller also portrays the fear felt by the men by telling the novel in a third-person point of view.  When a reader only experiences one character's viewpoint, the reader can have difficulty judging what may be exaggerated or underestimated.  With the third-person, readers enjoy objectivity.  For instance, one could come to the conclusion that all of the soldiers are afraid.  For example, Havermeyer is a bombardier that will fly in straight, drop his bombs, and fly out with little or no evasive maneuvering.  However at La Spezia, an Italian port where the men encountered very heavy antiaircraft fire, \\""even Havermeyer resorted to the wildest evasive action he could command when he saw what a vast distance he had still to travel to escape\\"" (375).  Readers realize that the fear that Yossarian feels is universal.  However, Yossarian is the prime example of what fear can drive a person to do. <br /> <br />Yossarian is driven to many unusual actions because of his fear of dying.  He pretended that he had a liver condition so as to stay in the hospital.   <br />   <br />   \\""Yossarian ran right into the hospital, determined to remain there forever rather than fly one mission more than the thirty-two missions he had.  Ten days after he changed his mind and came out, the colonel raised the missions to forty-five and Yossarian ran right back in, determined to remain in the hospital forever rather than fly one mission more than the six missions more he had just flown\\"" (165).   <br /> <br />He also walked \\""backward with his gun on his hip and refused to fly any more missions\\"" (392).  Yossarian was willing to start injuring people from his company, just to keep from flying.   <br /> <br />Heller's novel, Catch-22, deserves its place as one of America's classic novels.  The book explores the mentalities of the men putting their lives on the line for America.  Heller's past influenced his writing of the book, and his use of several literary devices form his message.  The catch is that people will take advantage of a person, just because that person cannot stop them.  He was able to mold his novel into a classic by asking one question: what's the catch? <br />   <br />",2006-03-29

In the end I found out that it's the (I) reader who is crazy, that the world (I) he lives in is crazy, the job (I) he does is crazy, the aspirations (I) he holds are crazy, the mind (I) he tries to expand is crazy, and yet it feels good, and sacred, and meaningful, and happy, and cuddly, because (I) he makes it to be so, and because others say it is, and because (I) he is never going to be Youssarian (although secretly (I) he dreams of becoming like him).<br /><br />For those of you who don't have time to delve into the story completely I recommend the movie.

Captain Yossarian, quirky and extremely paranoid, is the protagonist of the tale. Throughout the story, he is paranoid that everyone around him is trying to kill him. Yossarian's only wish is to fly the required number of missions, seeing as he is an American bombardier during World War II, and return home. However, due to the prideful actions of his Colonel, Yossarian has difficulty fulfilling his goal. Colonel Cathcart continually raises the number of missions his bombardiers have to fly in order to increase his own glory. Catch-22 is an accounting of the actions Yossarian takes to try and escape death, as well as the story of all the interesting, slightly odd, people he meets.<br /><br />When the number of required missions is first raised, Yossarian travels to the Army doctor to try and get the doctor to certify him as insane. However, Doc Daneeka refuses to allow Yossarian to get out of his missions due to the now-infamous Catch-22. According to the army's regulation Catch-22, any soldier who tries to get out of fighting by pleading insanity is showing personal concern. By showing this concern, the person proves himself sane, because insane people don't care about their lives. Men who are truly insane have no trouble flying more missions. However, since the only way to be \\""grounded\\"" is to request that you are, and the act of asking implies sanity, no person can get out of flying their missions. Yossarian, therefore, has no choice but to continue to fly the ever-increasing number of required missions.<br /><br />Yossarian, foiled in his attempt to plead insanity, attempts a number of other measures. First, he pretends to have some sort of liver problem and is checked into the hospital. In order to avoid being bored, Yossarian forges the name \\""Washington Irving\\"" on a number of the soldiers letters home he is asked to censor instead of writing his official signature. This action leads to a huge problem later on in the book as all the officers try to discover who Washington Irving really is. That problem is only compounded as various other soldiers began copying Yossarian. When he is finally thrown out of the hospital, Yossarian moves a line on a map of Italy to avoid flying a dangerous mission.<br /><br />Through the next section of the book, Yossarian has to deal with the deaths of several of his closest \\""friends.\\"" Snowden, the young Nately, and Hungry Joe are all bombardiers like Yossarian who ultimately get caught by one accident or another and die. With these deaths, Yossarian simply refuses to fly any more missions. This has a profound influence on the other soldiers stationed with Yossarian, and they silently begin to support him. Because of this, Colonel Cathcart offers to make a deal with Yossarian. If Yossarian will return back to the states and tell everyone how wonderful his superior officers are, they will let him go home. At first he considers the offer, but then realizing that it would be selling-out his fellow soldiers, Yossarian refuses.<br /><br />Instead, when the chaplain brings Yossarian to the living quarters of Orr, Yossarian realizes that Orr is not lost at sea like everyone believes. Instead, Orr carefully planed his escape by practicing crash landings on every flight he made. This time, instead of returning to the base, Orr had made his was to Sweden. Yossarian decides that he will run away to Sweden and join Orr there so he does not have to continue to risk his life fighting in the war.<br /><br />Review:<br /><br /> Unlike most books about World War II, Catch-22 does not attempt to describe specific battles and provide insight in the course of a war. Rather, it deals with the human interactions that are a part of war. Catch-22 is more than just a war novel, it is a novel about why people act the way they do when put into certain situations. I really enjoyed reading Catch-22.<br /><br />One of themost dominant themes in Catch-22 is that of insanity. In almost every chapter of the book there are examples of people using insane argumentation to make logical points. Catch-22 takes a look at the way people form so-called reasonable assumptions and proves how everyone, it seems, is crazy in their own way.<br /><br />In the very beginning of the book, Yossarian travels to the hospital and meets the army Clergyman. Once he decides that the man is not insane, Yossarian warns him that insanity is contagious, and, indeed, by the end of the book it seems that Yossarian is correct. By the second chapter, Yossarian has determined that war itself is madness. Men fight and die for a crazy notion of patriotism and that doesn't seem to bother anyone. Yossarian's friends think he is crazy because he recognizes the insanity around him, however Yossarian realizes that it is this awareness that will ultimately save his life. Because Yossarian knows he is in constant danger because of those surrounding him, he is prepared to defend himself against anything at any moment.<br /><br />The presence of the Catch-22 itself is a prime example of insanity in the book. It employs insanity to come to an insane conclusion, yet on the surface appears to be a logical chain of reasoning. Even doctors in the book are figures of madness. Yossarian is evaluated by a psychiatrist who determines that he is insane, however, because Yossarian went to the doctor under a different name, the doctor sends a different soldier home even though he knows that person is not the one he diagnosed as crazy.<br /><br />Another example of irrational circular logic occurs when Yossarian proposes to Luciana. Luciana refuses to marry Yossarian because she believes he is insane. She thinks he's insane because he wants to marry her. Luciana tells Yossarian he is crazy, yet she justifies this belief with irrational thinking, proving herself delusional.<br />Perhaps the best irony of the book however, is that Orr, supposedly the craziest of all the men, ends up being the sanest. In the beginning, Orr tells irrational stories and walks around with strange objects in his mouth. He does this so if anyone ever asks him why he has a certain object in his mouth, he can say that he doesn't have that thing in his mouth and pull out something else. He is, of course, utterly sensible in this belief. Orr is also, however, believed to be the luckiest man in the unit, because he is always crashing his plane and making it out alive. In the last chapter of the book, Orr crashes his plane in the ocean and disappears. Yossarian is at first shocked by this news, then stunned, as he realizes that Orr was not actually crazy. Rather, Orr feigned insanity in order to disguise his escape plans. The last time he crashes, Orr went to Sweden instead of simply dying like everyone thought. In the end, Orr used his insanity as his cover, and as his ticket to freedom.<br /><br />Typically, I am not a fan of any book dealing with historical wars. Catch-22 however, caught my interest quickly and held it throughout the book. I would recommend this book to everyone, no matter what kind of genre they usually enjoy.ost every chapter of the book there are examples of people using insane argumentation to make logical points.

So what, exactly, is the purpose of Joseph Heller's \\""Catch-22?\\"" <br /> <br />Is it to provide a biting satire of the reputed leaders of the Armed Forces?  Is it to illustrate the dehumanization of war by a blind bureaucracy?  Is it to entertain us with a dark comedy and clownish, cartoonish figures like Colonel Cathcart?  Is it, perhaps, to parody the excesses and extremes of capitalism and communism through Milo's syndicate?  Is it to illustrate the horrors of war in graphic detail?  Is it to convey the inevitability of death and futility of escaping your ultimate fate?  Or is it simply an exercise in paradoxical reasoning and illogical logic? <br /> <br />The answer, of course, to all of these questions is yes.  Heller has delivered a masterpiece of a novel, one that works on many levels.  His unorthodox methods prove triumphant in the end.  Through light comedy, absurd logic, and haunting flashbacks, Heller presents a war, which may be fought for idealistic purposes, but is executed in an arbitrary and self-defeating manner, whose only glory lies in the odious commanders.  Although this is not an anti-war novel, it certainly criticizes how the war is fought.     <br /> <br />Catch-22 could be divided into two parts.  The first 2/3 of the book provides a circular timeline, as the non-sequitur chapters help to paint a vivid picture of the lives of Yossarian and his comrades.  At first, only minor details are revealed.  As the chapters progress, though, the details are filled in, like an intricate jigsaw puzzle, and the reader is left to ascertain the meanings of earlier, cryptic inferences and allusions.  In these chapters, a light comic mood prevails, interrupted periodically by such accounts as the siege of Bologna.  Indeed, some of the chapters are high-comedy.  If M*A*S*H wasn't inspired by this novel, it sure borrows some of the same comic elements.  However, Heller reminds the reader that there is still a war going on, as death and destruction come into the forefront periodically.  The last 1/3 of the book provides a linear timeline and marches incessantly toward the final climax.  In these chapters, the mood turns much darker and sinister, as the deaths pile up and the humor dissipates.    <br /> <br />Heller provides a portrait of each of Yossarian's comrades in the squadron.  Some, are comical and absurd, such as the enigmatic Major Major, who only allows people inside his office when he is out of the office.  Some are idealistic and sympathetic, such as Clevinger and Nately.  While others are boorish and brutish, such as Colonel (take your pick).  However, the narrative is told from Yossarian's point of view, so, although we are never told specific details about him, the reader can delve into his mind and discover the kind of person he is. <br /> <br />Overall, Heller delivers a masterpiece.  Catch-22 provides an entrancing, enthralling and interweaving narrative of details and ideals that paints a glorious picture of a war-time bureaucracy gone amok.

Although Heller wrote numerous other books, I defy any average Joe to name any except for the \\""sequel\\"" to Catch 22 (called Closing Time) and the often considered \\""sacrilegious\\"" posthumous Portrait of An Artist As An Old Man.  Nonetheless Heller ended up writing one of the most endearing, hilarious and poignant American novels ever. <br /> <br />Catch 22 follows the exploits of a WWII American bomber pilot named Yossarian.  We follow Yossarian through numerous missions and extra-curricular events in around his air force base and various locations throughout Europe.  Yossarian is a wise cracking paranoid fellow who often finds himself in the most absurd of situations that end up being revealing slices of life.  It's political satire at its best and one of the book's many strengths is the ability to change the reader's reality so that the absurd seems commonplace. <br /> <br />Catch 22 has many things going for it.  \\""Laugh out loud hilarity\\"" is a phrase I've often heard others (and myself) use to describe Catch 22.  One of the funniest books ever, it gets better with each read...Yossarian and his cronies are loveable characters that you will come to care about root for to survive.  Besides being hilarious the book has many touching and horrifying moments as it deals with monstrosities and casualties of war.  To top it off, Catch 22 is more relevant as a military satire due to current world events. <br /> <br />Amongst my group of peers (mid to late 20 somethings), Catch 22 seems to be the most common \\""all time favorite book\\"" and I would have to say it's top 3 for me as well.

Joseph Heller shows you fault after fault in mankind, but does so with such enjoyable dry wit that you hardly realize he's pulling apart your perception of reality at the seams. It's a good thing, too, since otherwise it would be 430 pages of despair and hopelessness. By the end, perhaps, you might even be glad he flipped  your view of life upside-down. <br /> <br />The majority of the plot focuses on Captain Yossarian, a lusty bombardier who's convinced that everyone's out to kill him and wants nothing more than to be sent home. He's stopped at every turn, however, by the titular rule catch-22. Heller doesn't focus on the actual rule itself--it's mentioned by name only a few times in the entire novel--but rather on what it embodies and stands for. It states that for an officer to be grounded, he must be crazy, but he has to ask for it, though if he asks to be grounded on the grounds that he is crazy, he must not be crazy. Throughout the novel, catch-22 mutates into a way that the military can justify whatever it does. To quote Yossarian and his friend Doc Daneeka, \\""That's some catch, that catch-22.\\"" \\""It's the best there is.\\"" (Heller, 55) <br /> <br />Between Yossarian's storyline are dozens of smaller stories about everyone around him, from his commanding officer Colonel Catchcart to the chaplain. These, along with the rest of the chapters, occur only in partial chronological order. For  every set of chapters that appear in order, Heller throws in a story completely out of order. Sometimes they help explain the events of the surrounding chapters, but other times they seem to be shuffled around capriciously. The side stories also have a tendency to grow somewhat tedious, mostly because of a lack of dialogue and movement. It isn't unusual for Heller to continue a single paragraph for several pages; he has a liking for run-on sentences as well. Still, none of them are unbearably long or boring and they do give the reader a chance to see events from the multiple characters' points of view. <br /> <br />Most of the book takes place in the Air Force base where Yossarian lives, but there are a smattering of scenes set in Rome and smaller locations throughout Italy. Heller obviously did his research on WWII, as there's very accurate descriptions of technology from that era. Unless the reader was there themselves, they might come out wondering if Heller was actually a bombardier himself. <br /> <br />Catch-22 is the epitome of military satire, but Heller doesn't let his choice of setting limit himself. Nothing is safe against ridicule: society, bureaucracy, and humans themselves all fall prey to his dark wit. Still, for all his jabbings in the ribs of life, his humor usually stays well away from being tasteless. If you do throw Catch-22 down in disgust, it's probably because you just realized how incompetent man really is. In that way, his style is somewhat similar to Douglas Adams, though more subtle and less quirky. Heller's sense of humor may be so subtle, in fact, that readers more used to conventional and obvious humor may completely miss some of the implied jokes. Mixed in with the biting comedy are ideas that really make the reader think: \\""You're inches away from death every time you go on a mission. How much older can you be at your age?\\"" (Heller, 48) At times it seems like Heller is softening the reader up with humor just so he can blindside them with a ponderous thought. <br /> <br />Despite it's age, Catch-22 is a surprising accessible read. It's hardly a book for young adults; Heller obviously wrote his most famous work for a very adult audience. There is some rough language and adult themes. Some readers may be intimidated by it's length, but aside from a few sluggish parts, the book can get rather exciting.  <br /> <br />Readers with a bit of patience and an open mind will probably enjoy this novel. Heller will make you laugh, cry, and possibly rethink your outlook on life.

On the one hand, this book is widely considered a masterpiece, and friends who know my reading tastes were shocked that I hadn't read and fallen in love with this book.  On the other hand, the (newer) copy of the book I read starts out with a pretty lame preface by the author: he writes about what great reviews the book got, and how well-received the book was.  It's hard not to come away from such a self-congratulatory preface without a bad taste in your mouth. <br /> <br />So did the book live up to the hype?  No, not really.  Heller is exceedingly clever at times, and he displays a masterful command of the language.  The characters are all top-notch - well illustrated and interesting to read about.   <br /> <br />However, the flaws were also very apparent.  Catch-22 weighs in at 452 pages; while the characters remain interesting, the zany predicaments they land themselves in become repetitious.  For example, a chapter after Yossarian learns about 'Catch-22', he has a conversation with a prostitute, who tells him that she won't marry him because he's insane, and he's insane because he wants to marry her.  I felt like I was reading a recycled joke - nowhere near the laugh-out-loud hilarity I was expecting.   <br /> <br />The story is not told in a linear fashion - characters will talk about an event in chapter 2 that isn't described until chapter 10 - and this gives the story a meandering, episodic sitcom sort of feeling.  Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't.  So far as themes go, the book does a decent job of mixing absurd inanity with serious war-time events, but I personally feel that Vonnegut mixes tragedy and comedy far more skillfully than Heller. <br /> <br />Also, I thought Catch-22 would be the story of Yossarian trying to act crazy in order to bypass Catch-22, but this isn't the case.  Catch-22 is really a collection of loosely-related zany incidents that Yossarian's squadron go through - the story of \\""Catch-22\\"" is really just one in a series of clever conversations.  <br /> <br />Despite all my reservations, Catch-22 is still a better book than most books you'll read, and most definitely worth reading if you haven't already.

Heller was a navigator on a bomber in World War II and draws inspiration from his experiences  I am a self-proclaimed history buff, and I especially love war in American society.  But sometimes reading the same heroic war stories or glorifications of a great battle can become redundant.  Heller's satire is the proverbial breath of fresh air in comparison to the endless volumes of war related material. <br /> <br />    The story follows Yossarian, an aviator/bombadeer in World War II.  It becomes clear very quickly that Yossarian is about a nickel short of a dollar.  He imagines that everyone he knows or comes in contact with, save a few of his good friends, wants him dead.  The problem is with the system of flying bombing missions in the military.  When he began flying, an aviator was sent home after his 25th mission.  But as he continues to fly, his commander Colonel Cathcart increases the minimum number of missions an aviator must fly.  To escape his dangerous assignments, Yossarian fakes a liver disease and is sent to the base hospital.  It is here that he is first introduced to \\""Catch-22.\\"" <br /> <br />     Yossarian and Doc Daneeka, the medical officer, are good friends.  So Yossarian asks Doc to lie on his medical exam and report that he is not mentally fit to fly.  Doc explains to Yossarian that because Yossarian asks him to do this, he is in essence proving his sanity.  He goes on to explain that anyone that would fly a plane into enemy territory is surely not mentally stable enough to fly a plane into enemy territory. (Read that sentence again if you don't get it the first time.)  But anyone who asks to be examined proves that he is sane enough to perform the same task. Catch-22 is basically a lose-lose situation. <br /> <br />     The part of the novel I found most interesting is only discussed a few times.  The characterof the soldier in white appears in the hospital at the beginning of the novel.  None of the men in the hospital know his name, and no one knows why he is there or where he is from.  The soldier in white symbolizes the anonymity of the men that fight for America.  Men gave their lives every day during that war, yet they are not famous.  Society does not seem to care about who is fighting, but only that they are fighting for their country. <br /> <br />     Catch-22 is a must-read for anyone finding interest in war.  It does well to hold the reader's attention.  The mixture of off-the-wall humor and obvious irony make it an enjoyable read.  It may or may not be historically accurate, but Heller probably did not intend for it to be.

Heller's characters are all quirky, intense and unique, but their conversations and actions really penetrate the absurdity of war and are very entertaining. I personally think the larger goals of World War II were noble and worthy, but when the impact of the war on those people who were actually fighting it are examined through Heller's off-kilter viewpoint, it becomes clear that there are tremendous costs and failings when trying to achieve those goals.

I would highly recommend this book for anyone who has not read it before.",2005-08-09

Much of the novel revolves around Captain Yossarian, a bombardier in the squadron.  Heller has crafted an outrageous satire of the military.  He mercilessly mocks many aspects of the military: rank structure, chain of command, protocol, the military justice system, the chaplaincy, the military medical establishment, and more.  Heller's squadron and its higher headquarters form a world of cowardice, opportunism, and scheming; particularly biting is his portrait of jealousy, vanity, and self-serving ambition among the senior officers.<br /><br />The book is filled with many absurd images and zany situations, as well as with characters who have such names as Major Major, Colonel Korn, and Lieutenant Scheisskopf.  Heller's prose is a delight; the pages crackle and pop with clever wordplay and witty lines.  The book made me laugh out loud.  But the wacky comedy and merry prose style are wedded to a dark vision; the book is full of graphic violence and Kafkaesque nightmarishness.  There are also some vividly rendered scenes of aerial combat.  It's quite a remarkable blend.<br /><br />The story follows Yossarian and his comrades in combat, while being treated in the hospital, during down time on their base, and on their recreational excursions into war-torn Italy.  We see the relationships among the squadron members, as well as their dalliances with the women they meet during their tour.  And we also learn the meaning of Catch-22, a bureacratic clause that controls the destinies of these military men.  Yossarian is a compelling antihero, and \\""Catch-22\\"" is a richly ironic work of satire.

The story takes place in an airbase, on a small island off the cost of Italy, during the end of World War II.  The sitcom feel comes from the over twenty central characters, each with their own different fears, ambitions, passions, personalities, goals and beliefs.  Not to mention each character is INSANE in his own personal way.  From the rebellious Yosarrian, who believes everybody is out to kill him, to the capitalistic Milo, who bombs the base himself as a business investment, the misadventures that occur on the island when all these characters try to survive with one another bestows upon the story its sitcom-like charm.   <br />  <br />The author, Joseph Heller, uses elements such as dark humor, explicit violence, and everything in between to craft this novel.  By making you laugh out loud on one page, and then sicken you with disgust on the next, Heller demonstrates the utter insanity of war.  He blatantly accuses the government and the military of turning their back on the innocent men they USED to do their dirty work.  The generals in Catch-22 are portrayed as irrational, ignorant, and power hungry because they are more concerned with the prestige they may receive than the number of men they pointlessly send to their death. <br />  <br />On the whole I would recommend this book because of its ability to be humorous, appalling, and thought provoking all at the same time.  By the end, the reader begins to understand the hopelessness of all the characters because they are not evil men, but the war forces them to choose between doing evil and being killed.  <br />",2005-05-27

Through his realistic characters and witty and humorous use of dialogue, Heller allows the reader to infer their own opinion about war and governemnt, and the effet that war has on individuals.  Through the use of humor and understatement, he paints a picture of what war does to men; their ambitions, thir fear, and the inevitahle death of whoever happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, which he describes as \\""a matter of circumstance.\\""  This novel portrays a host of characters, all believeable and true to life.  Yossarian has a rational an understandable fear of death, and he questions an institution whose word is absolute law.  Yossarian sees that good men die for antoher man's cause, and in turn question his own positon in the war and what he is doing there, fighting in a war he deson't believe in.  <br /> <br />The concept of Catch-22 showed the absolute power that the military had over the men, and also demonstrated how when soemthing is accepted and not questioned, it can have power over people.  Catch-22 did not exist, but because people believed it did, it had power and influence over them.   <br /> <br />In the novel, humor is used in such a way that what is written seems light and fivolous, but really holds a deeper and more horrifying meaning.  There were several instances of this:  the interrogatioin of Clevinger and the chaplain, Cathcart's obsession with missions and getting into the Saturday Evening Post, the very definition of Catch-22, Doc Daneeka's \\""death\\"", and Milo's extreme capitalism.  <br /> <br />The effects of war are plainly seen as well:  Yossarion's progression from acceptance of his missions to falt denial to go up in a plane ever agian, his questioning of the war itself, the deaths of the men, Nately's girlfriend's insanity after she hears the devestating news, the ambitioin of the men of higher rank in the military, the chaplain's doubts and fears, and Milo's increasing empire, M&M Enterprises. <br /> <br />Despite all of the horrors, Heller presents us with a light of hope in the character Orr, Yossarian's comapanion who is more than he seems.  He manages to escape and this gives Yossarian the extra push to make his own decisioin about escaping the trap that Catch-22 has him in.   <br /> <br />Each character, as I said earlier, is realistic and believble, which makes the novel more meaningful and appealing to me.  There is a rainbow of personalitioes, from the quiet chaplain to outspoken Yossarian, the hypchondriac Doc Daneeka, the excessive capitalist Milo, the ambitious Cathcart, the fearful and awe-insiring Major____de Coverly, young and naive Nately, the prostitues, as well as many others.  All of these characters are real people facing real issues that are connected to and rooted in war.  There is a struggle for survival that these people must face, and they all face it in their own way.  Some are succesful, and some aren't.   <br /> <br />Heller presents, then, a novel of paradoxes, a novel about war and survival, hoplessness and hope, ambition and humility.  He describes the horor of war without actually stating it.  And though this book deals with serious issues, it is also very entertaining to read.  I laughed aloud numerous times and enjoyed reading every page.  And so, this gifted author leaves us with a novel I consider to be one of the greatest I have ever read.

This is Heller's comical \\""masterpiece\\"" in the eyes of many.  It is definitely comical, but a masterpiece?  That was a tough sell for me. <br /> <br />The story shifts time, plot, and characters in manner that is confusing.  It works well in this novel because the entire book is an ode absurdity.  The total and complete absurdity of war.  One can probe deeper into the real depth of the story underlining the humor, but ever Heller himself commented that it was little more than a dark, comic act on the stupidity of war.  He did not even intend it to be a thundering social statement, but rather a refreshing look at the irony that exists in all wars. <br /> <br />The main character of the novel is Yossarian.  He is kind of the books anti-hero, if you will.  Certainly he is the most famous.  The book is filled with ridiculous and memorable characters and they are all interconnected by Heller in a rather ingenious fashion.  No concrete plot exists, it is rather a map a random events that occur in the lives of these madmen during World War II.  There ranges everything from a quiet, gentle priest, to a psychotic whore, to rich, indignant soldiers, to ordinary a Major; to ruthless a General's and so on.  It would take too long to go into depth about every character.  Rest assured, they are drawn out with style and individuality by Heller in some of the wackiest scenes you will ever read in a novel. <br /> <br />Catch 22 is told in third person, but the majority of the focus is on Yossarian.  Yossarian has his fair share of flaws and mishaps, but he tends to be the one we sympathize and root for more than any other person.  Yet it is hard to root for, or care about anyone too deeply because it seems like you are always laughing.  You laugh even when you should be horrified, because some of the scenes are indeed horrifying, but they are downplayed so much by Heller that our reaction becomes tamperedwith.  Instead of a feeling of power, we are left with a feeling of confusion. <br /> <br />The only novel I can compare it to is Vonnegut's darker, wiser Slaughterhouse 5.  In that novel, the author was able to maintain a delicate balance between sarcasm, humor, and pain.  It was easy to see the author was hiding the pain of his experiences in the war through the dark, sarcastic humor.  That made it powerful and breathtaking, along with the humor.  In Catch 22, the sarcasm and humor exist; in fact, it is actually a funnier book.  However, the power and the pain do not shine through and the book seems like an attempt to downplay the seriousness of war. It left me confused at times with its dark, disturbing passages that should be powerful, but are not, because the book, for the most part, is usually told in a style of a comedic satire. <br /> <br />Catch 22 is a funny and original tale of World War II.  At times, the passages reach a level of total genius with witty and cutting remarks.  At times, it even makes you laugh and think deeply on how ridiculous war really is.  I admired the numerous weirdo characters Heller described.  I just didn't feel any real power or awe to it all.  It was like watching a dark comedy unfolding in front of your eyes.  You laugh, but when it is all over it is quickly forgotten.   <br /> <br />Perhaps that was the flaw for me in Catch 22.  I wish I could have taken it a little more seriously.  I think Heller goes a bit too extreme with his silliness and comedy, because when the \\""powerful\\"" scenes of horror and anguish did finally come, I found myself not really caring too much, but I felt that I should have been moved in some way.  It was an awkward mix for me.  Not to say that I don't recommend Catch 22.  Many passages are genius and I love the originality.  It is definitely, for the majority of the time, a hilarious read.  There is just that one catch, and who knows, maybe the confusion I felt was just another intended Catch 22, amongmany others in the novel. <br /> <br />Grade: B+",2005-04-20

Written with cynical insight and sharp black humour, the book is a cutting critical analysis of Western society and its various forms & devices - in particular the concepts of War, Capitalism and governmental bureaucracy. <br /> <br />Set during WWII, the story focuses around a US Army regiment, in particular a bombardier called Yossarian. Cynical, paranoid and rebellious, Yossarian is desperate to be returned home from war. Surrounded by a surreal cast of bizarre characters, from eccentric friends to Machiavellian leaders, he is angry and suspicious of the war effort, cynical towards the point of it all. <br /> <br />Faking insanity and hiding out in the field hospital leads Yossarian to discover the cruel & immobilising concept at the center of his highers' mentality - Catch-22. The catch is, that insanity is the only valid ticket home, but any request to be grounded is surely a sign of sanity - and therefore voiding the initial excuse. In short, they're dammned if they do & they're dammned if they don't. To add to his increasing depression and frustration, Yossarian must watch as the minimum number of missions required is increased by the tyrannical Colonel Catchcart, and watch his various friends die along the way. <br /> <br />For me the key element of the book's excellence lies in the masterful comedy of the writing. I laughed aloud often. Used to highlight the insanity and illogical mentality of those in power within the army, the humour displays the moronic ironies for all to see. Superbly witty, the comedy is extremely dry - a fact which might explain why some people don't 'get' this book. The situations and humour are certainly surreal and strange, a factor for me that makes me love the book even more, but I understand that some readers are alienated by this. 'Catch-22' is not your typical novel. <br /> <br />One of the great satirical works, 'Catch-22' is a very important book, as it draws attention to vital flaws and corruptions within our Western world. One character who stands out for me is Milo, the Mess Hall Officer, who represents capitalism perfectly by using his position to profit from trading with various countries, including enemy sides. In this instance, capitalism is shown to have no morals or patriotic loyalty, stepping over whoever it must in order to grasp the next dollar. <br /> <br />It is a writing that is more relevant today than ever. Not only does it highlight the sheer futility of war, but it also shows how the illogical desires of an elite can hold power over the silent majority. Yossarian stands alone in his fight against his highers, and he represents a long tradition of the solo non-conformist, rebelling against oppression. Ultimately a optimistic book, it shows the possibility of the small man's triumph over corruption.  <br /> <br />Timeless & flawless - you must read this book",2005-04-13

Heller takes a lighthearted and satirical approach to address the serious topic of war.  While doing this, he addresses several themes including the idea that money and power corrupt, and conveys the loss of religious faith and the overall uselessness and destructiveness of war. <br />  <br />Catch-22 takes place on Pianosa, a small island in the Mediterranean Sea.  The reader witnesses Yossarian and his desperate attempts to get out of the war.  He was once a great bombardier, but loses interest after he witnesses the death of a man on his plane.  He no longer cares about the assigned missions and instead \\""had decided to live forever or die in the attempt, and his only mission each time he went up was to come down alive\\"" (29).  Yossarian finds himself trapped in the war due to his antagonist, Colonel Cathcart, a man so interested in being promoted that he will put other people's lives in danger.  The problem is that Cathcart continually raises the number of missions required of the men in order to complete their service in the army.  \\""They were in a race and knew it, because they knew from bitter experience that Colonel Cathcart might raise the number of missions again at any time\\"" (27).  Yossarian finds himself closing in on the number of missions he needs to get out of the war, but sees the number rise just before he can get there.  He can also be excused from service if he is insane, but Catch-22 makes this option impossible.  One part of Catch-22 says that a man is insane if he flies his bombing missions, but if the man says that he is insane and asks to be excused from duty, the fact that he is requesting this proves that he is in fact perfectly sane because \\""a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind\\"" (46). <br />  <br />Catch-22 features many separate characters, all ofwhich have their own side stories.  The book often switches from present to past to allow the reader to learn much about many of the characters.  Most of the focus, however, is given to Yossarian, a character who is hard not to like and feel sorry for.  The novel shows how Yossarian and the other characters spend their time in the army-both during missions and during their free time.  The reader gets to witness how the characters deal with the war and watch as some of them, characters like Colonel Cathcart and the cook, Milo Minderbinder, use the war to their advantage.  Catch-22 is a constant struggle by Yossarian to save his life and to stop flying bombing missions. <br />  <br />Catch-22 features several important themes.  The first shows how power and money corrupt.  Most people would hate being at war, but Colonel Catchart and Milo Minderbinder definitely do not mind.  Cathcart is a man who cares about little else than being promoted.  His powerful position and hunger for more power drives him to raise the number of missions his men must fly in order to complete their military service in order to impress his superiors and possibly get his promotion.  Milo, on the other hand, is totally driven by money.  He runs a syndicate where he is constantly buying and selling goods throughout Europe.  However, he begins to lose money and is willing to do just about anything to make money back.  \\""One night, after a sumptuous evening meal, all Milo's fighters and bombers took off, joined in formation directly overhead and began dropping bombs on the group.  He had landed another contract with the Germans, this time to bomb his own outfit\\"" (257).  Both Milo and Cathcart are willing to endanger the other soldiers just to feed their appetites for money and power.  Their corruption is only one of the several themes present in Catch-22. <br />  <br />Other ideas that are introduced in the novel are the loss of faith and the uselessness of war.  After being involved in the war for so long, Yossarian has abandoned any belief in a higher being.  He says, \\""And don't tell me God works in mysterious ways.  There's nothing so mysterious about it.  He's not working at all.  He's playing.  Or else He's forgotten all about us...What in the world was running through that warped, evil, scatological mind of His...Why in the world did He ever create pain?\\"" (179).  The war, along with the viciousness and selfishness of the people that Yossarian deals with have led him to lose any religious faith he might have had.  He does not agree with the war that he is fighting in and seeing his friends die in.  War, in the novel, is overall depicted as useless since there is no real reason why the men are fighting, except for the benefit of people higher up in command. <br />  <br />Overall, Catch-22 is an excellent book.  The only complaints that could be made about it is the fact that it is sometimes difficult to follow since the plot jumps from the present to past without warning.  Also, there are numerous characters with many names and military positions to get confused.  However, after a while, one will get used to this and it will not be hard to finish the novel.  Joseph Heller decides to depict war in a comical and satirical manner, styles that are not often used for books in the war genre.  It is a very funny book, but is also deeply significant since it addresses the ideas of power, money, corruption, religion, and the uselessness and viciousness of war.  It is a great read and is wholeheartedly recommended to anyone who is interested in reading a classic. <br />  <br />",2005-03-17

We all ran for the woods and hid until dusk and then snuck around to the house avoiding Big John because we were afraid of being caught and becoming forced labor in the cleanup in Big Johns reenactment of the Dresden bombing. Even as kids we understood the importance of learning from history...Speaking of history I had a good conversation with Big Johns younger brother Roscoe about the Dresdan story and he remembered hearing about about it but was not present, he mentioned that knowing his brother as he does (as a brother) that it all made perfect sense. He related to me a story about when Big John and Big Joe (Big Joe is Roscoes twin,he was younger than Big John as well, in addition he was not as big as Big John despite the fact that he was big) would play a game with a rubber ball when the folks were out of the house, kind of like basketball except the object was to throw the ball in the toilet, the looser had to fish the ball out. However as Roscoe explained and what ads credence to my Dresdan story is that Big John would always make Big Joe fish the ball out no matter who made the basket...Off the subject abit but I cant help myself, my friend Roscoe is a self-made millionaire, he had the idea a few years ago to convert old washing machines into dog houses and made a fortune, he cashed out and travels the states with his girl friend Lora lee lee and his monkey Tater.",2005-01-17

The author, Joseph Heller inadvertently added it to the English language when he used it to describe an American regulation governing pilot's required number of combat missions.<br /><br />The rule was this: Pilots could only be grounded if they were insane; however they had to request this.  But - asking to be grounded proved you sane and so there was no escape, and this was known as Catch-22.<br /><br />This simple problem becomes a metaphor for all that goes on in this novel and correspondingly, in virtually any warfare. The book is bitingly funny, filled with tragic incidents and is chaotic, much like war.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the lives of a group of American bomber pilots in World War II.  The central character is Yossarian, who we first met in hospital. The book details events form his life in a seemingly random order, in some ways similar to Kurt Vonnegut's, &#34;Slaughterhouse Five&#34; where an American soldier becomes &#34;unstuck in time.&#34; In Heller's case, this isn't as blatant and you see the order is in fact carefully constructed to build towards a climax.<br /><br />Yossarian is surrounded by a cast of bizarre characters, including Colonel Scheisskopf, obsessed with winning military parades at the expense of just about everything else. Then there is the newly promoted Major Major, who once promoted, becomes Major Major Major and then spends most of the war trying to hide from his men.<br /><br />Each of the unique and colorful characters adds a bit to the pastiche of moods and attitudes deftly displayed here. Absurdities run through the book such as when Doc Daneeka was supposedly killed when the plane he was in crashed...he wasn't killed since he always avoided flying, but in the US Air Force, once it's in the paperwork, it's a done deal...so there's no going back - to everyone else, including his misinformed wife, he remains dead - no discussion.<br /><br />It's a simple idea to posit that war is absurd but it takes a clever writer to illustrate through the actions and  of his characters.

In fact, there's some pretty compelling arguments why it could be considered the best novel of the 20th century. This from the critics.  <br /> <br />It's also an enormous international bestseller. That is to say, it's not some kind of weird, experimental thing with some enormous political axe to grind that normally wins Pulitzers and garners accolades from the effete in their ivory towers. This is a book that all kinds of people from all walks of life have read and enjoyed. <br /> <br />Business Leader take note: when a book touches both the masses and the critics then something has been written that touches a chord in all humanity. This is something that you can learn from and use in your business setting. These books reveal the secrets about how everybody feels. It helps you violate the law against fooling all of the people all of the time, so to speak.  <br /> <br />We believe that Catch-22 has something even more special to offer. It reveals the truth about bureaucracy.  <br /> <br />It's a lot of fun today--and really has been since the time of the trustbusters in the age of Theodore Roosevelt--to hate big giant corporations. You can't sit in a coffee shop without hearing someone rant about Big Business and the evils it perpetrated upon the environment and people of struggling nations. You can't turn to fiction without constantly seeing Big Business presented as an all-consuming evil that manipulates nations and lives to its whims. The press has long delighted in portraying Big Business as preying upon the decent, the common, and the innocent.  <br /> <br />And in some cases they may be right.  <br /> <br />But there is a different truth. It is the truth that Big Business can't possibly organize itself and come to the kind of consensus necessary to prosecutethe vast majority of the injustices for which they're blamed. The simple truth of the matter is that bureaucracy--that maelstrom of decayed policies, outdated procedures, the futile and whimsical direction of middle-managers who have given up home, the ambitious subterfuge of self-serving middle-managers who are--or perceive that they are--on their way up, all crashing together like the planetessimiles in a proto-solar system bound together by the gravity of a thousand conflicting agenda, beliefs, and ideals... that bureaucracy prevents.  <br /> <br />Big Business blunders. It blunders its way through the world achieving much more by accident than it ever does by intent. It is why Big Businesses, which has always founded its strength upon originality, daring, and speed retreat to defense in lawyers and regulations when they age and suddenly find themselves stagnant, timid, and slow. The inevitable gravitational pull of bureaucracy on any Big Business pulls all to an entropic heat death.  <br /> <br />Catch-22 is a case study in exactly that kind of bureaucracy. It is the bureaucracy of the military--but really the same infectious bureaucracy found everywhere--as it attempts to win a war. An endless display of very real people are introduced to this blender of military bureaucracy and it is reduced to the terrible comedic.  <br /> <br />People love to read this book because it is so funny. But it's funny because the bureaucracy is so familiar. The people's behavior remind us of how the world really works outside of the board rooms, court rooms, and throne rooms.  <br /> <br />Every business leader should read this book if only to become so intimately familiar with the face of bureaucracy, which will always be the final and most terrible enemy that any business can face.  <br /> <br />READ MORE AT INCHOATUS.COM",2004-08-25

If you are looking for high-brow writing, I would say you are probably not looking in the right place.

Of course, this criticism stands for most books that turn into movies... <br /> <br />The book, as I mentioned, has a very off-beat narrative style.  Heller is very funny, but I don't think his sense of humor could be considered traditional.

The main character, Yossarians, is the one we can say is the craziest of all, but,in my opinion,he is the one with the clearest state of mind to judge the war. Because he is the one who is trying to avoid the wars and refuse to fly. Milo who is a mess officer who is trying to do business out of the war and really make popular and success in the book. And the other characters are also very interesting and make you to think that if it is possible that people who in the war really look like them. The most interesting of all is &quot;the catch&quot; that is catch-22 in which people are trapped. It says, &quot;Yossarrians can be allowed to stop flying if he is crazy but then he has to ask the doctor to ground him, then he is not crazy when is asked then he can not be grounded.&quot; Isn't it crazy and confused? <br /> As the story goes on, the real purpose of the wars is becoming more clear, the more the stupid the wars become, and the sad the story become.  <br /> As an Asian, I found that book is really difficult to understand but it will become more and more interesting and exciting in the end. So keep reading and you will find it really funny and insane or may be sad in the end. <br />",2004-07-28

(This is best articulated by Colonel Cathcart, who longs to be featured in the Saturday Evening Post.) Yosarean's solution is to not go into harm's way any longer. Most of the novel is rapturously funny with characters who never answer a question with a satisfactory response.

A significant choice for what is, ostensibly, an anti-war satire, since that particular war was a universally popular one butressed by high moral motivations. But that is the point, for Catch 22 is not simply a lampoon of war, but a searing indictment of man's spiritual crisis in the modern world.<br />On all fronts, the main character, Yossarian, is assailed by the dehumanized absurdities of mondern life, manifested most concretely in that perfected science of death, modern warfare. Yossarian, like all of us, is chained by rationality that has been stripped of reason, engineered thus for the purpose of control. That is the essence of Catch 22. <br />The character of Milo Minderbinder represents the cold, opportunistic thinking of the corporate world, dead as it is to humanistic concerns in its tireless pursuit of profit and power. Chaplain Tappman embodies the impotence and self-doubt common to many people of faith who feel adrift in a culture of materialisticly driven insanity. But it is Yossarian's wanderings through Rome, the Eternal City, and as such, the representation of modern &quot;civilized&quot; society, that is the coup de grace. It is a moonlit, poetic scene lamenting the spiritual and humanistic decay and ultimate bankruptcy of modern Western society. Simply powerful stuff.<br />Properly speaking, Catch 22 is more a series of vignettes or short stories rather than a novel. But it is told with a humor that bristles with moral outrage.

That's pretty much Yossarian's problem. He knows that the war going on around him and the people controlling things are crazy. Life, for Yossarian, is one enormous Catch-22; it often seems to be run by forces either hostile or totally indifferent to the human condition. All humanity can come up with is a sort of economic/power hierarchy through which they try to remain blind to the state of life. Capitalism has run amok, as have bureaucracies. Yossarian is alientated and trapped in near-despair and trying to figure out how a sane man is to live in a world that is against him? <br />Catch-22 is one of the truly great novels of the twentieth century because it is so honest and so penetrating. It's not just a war novel; Catch-22 is a novel that really encompasses the current human dilemma. Yossarian is really an Everyman character trying to live in the postmodern age. His choice is seemingly whether he should choose to die as a victim of the crazy world or choose a living death by buying into the insanity. That's why this novel is so affecting and why Yossarian resonates with so many people. He's in the same situation. He faces the same choices in this life. Ultimately, Catch-22 is a towering novel for its hope as Yossarian finally finds the courage to live.<br />I can't really say enough good about Catch-22. It's is funny and touching and so human.

It is about a World War II bombardier, Captain Yossarian, who desparately wants to be sent home but he is caught in the military's Catch-22. Catch-22 states that one can only be excused from flying missions on the grounds of insanity; one must request to be excused; one who requests to be excused is presumably in fear of his life, thus proof of his sanity so therefore he must continue to fly; one who is insane would not make the request and would continue to fly the missions despite the fact that he would be excused from them if he were to ask. The typical no-win situation. There are many characters presented in this book, adding to the confusion and enhancing the hilarity. The plot...well, there doesn't seem to be much of a plot but once the reader becomes caught up in the circular logic of the military, the plot doesn't seem important anyway.

In it, the army has absolute power, dictating the lives and fates of the men in its power. The military constantly increases the required missions for the men. Colonel Cathcart, the person who raises the mission requirement, is risking the lives of his men in order to impress his superior officers. This reflects the futility of their situation. The reason they risk their lives is not to help the country. Instead, they fight for the greed and ambitions of one man.<br />The main character, Yossarian, is constantly afraid that he is going to die.

I felt that it transcended time boundaries, and the horror of war that Heller effectively described in World War II could be held applicable to the current situation our country is in.  Through humor and circular logic, Heller accurately portrays the concept behind Catch 22 as not just being a military law, but how those with power can justify their actions over the powerless.  Each character Heller introduces to the reader is easy to relate to, for each represents a different type of conflict that each individual undergoes in his or her life.  Milo Minderbinder's character represents the temptation of big business and profit which still drives and corrupts people to this very day.  The chaplain, representing the loss of religious faith when faced with the hard circumstances of life and war, relates to many people in their questioning of a God in the midst of hatred, terrorism, and useless death.  Colonel Cathcart, representing corrupt military and governmental bureaucracy, is a portrayal of how many people in life desire to uphold their status and power at the expense of those below them in the social ladder.  Lastly there is Yossarian, a character portrayed by Heller to be both crazy and pitiable, is motivated in his actions solely by his longing to survive and his right to life.  <BR> What impressed me the most about this book was Heller's complicated writing style which was in itself a tool to portray to the reader the ridiculousness of the whole justification and reason behind the concept of Catch 22.  Whereas Heller uses the military law prohibiting bombardiers from avoiding flying combat missions as the actual embodiment of the Catch 22 trap, Heller's haphazard writing style and interaction between characters is a Catch 22 in itself.  In this way, Heller makes Catch 22 extend beyond the war to apply to life itself, and the traps that we encounter in our journey to save ourselves amidst tough circumstances.<BR>Heller succeeds tremendously in giving a moving portrayal of the atrocities of war while maintaining a humorous and satirical tone.  The reader will go through ups and downs, from laughing at the ridiculous dialogue between characters to being shocked by the useless death of many of the characters due to the inevitable death occurring in war.

Through the main character, Yossarian, and his various situations the author seems to comment on the individual use of morality as a counter to the governmental use of authority and power in a military bureaucracy.  Yossarian, a soldier in World War II, and his squadron's fate are placed in the hands of a group of leaders who are willing to sacrifice their men's lives for personal gain in the form of recognition.  Heller seems to use this situation to comment on the authoritative use of bureaucracy in that the men are led into futile situations by a bureaucracy that not only discards logic, but also has no regard for its defenders.  Yossarian and his fellow soldiers must use the illogical laws of their war bureaucracy to their advantages in order to survive.  They are all subject to the law of Catch-22.<br />Heller's Catch-22 ultimately defines situations in which all of the solutions of any given situation have negative results.  The author uses Catch-22 throughout his novel to show how logic can be circumvented in order to force Yossarian and his squadron to suffer through numerous personal situations and remain at war in a sort of bureaucratic military entrapment.  Catch-22 is used when Yossarian, as an instinct of preservation, tries to be discharged from the military-or at least tries to avoid combat-by claiming that he is insane.  But by claiming that he is insane, he is therefore seen as sane because no reasonable person would want to fly bombing missions.  Again, Catch-22 is used against Yossarian when he is offered the choice to be court-martialed or be released upon his approval of the policies of Colonels Cathcart and Korn.  The Catch-22 is that the policies require the men to fly eighty missions before being sent home and thereby jeopardizes their lives.<br />Perhaps the most important point that Heller makes in Catch-22 is that there is an alternative to Catch-22.  At the end of the novel, Yossarian discounts Catch-22 by opting for a different way out of war.  He deserts his unit and goes to Sweden, a neutral country, and rejects the military bureaucracy.  By this, Heller seems to say that while Catch-22-a contradictory condition of circular reasoning that holds its sufferer in its irrational environment and benefits only those who have made up the law-may seem inescapable; there is ultimately a way out.  Heller depicted World War II with a sense of disenchantment with the military.  This may be what made Catch-22 so controversial during the Vietnam War (and in the wake of what was considered The Good War).  Yossarian not only questions authority, but he finds an ultimate solution through desertion.  This is definitely not something that the government would have wanted young American draftsmen reading, however, it is valuable in its depiction of morality in the face of illogical or immoral situations such as war.",2004-04-11

Joseph Heller's novel, Catch-22, is renown for being one of the greatest satirical war novels of all time.  Heller's novel possesses great depth.  The book is obviously anti-war but it also attacks many other problems that lie within our society.  Heller attacks bureaucracies, capitalistic corporations, and other organizations that use individuals to benefit themselves.  Heller's novel is directed to anyone who is fed up with being used as a tool of success for another person.  The book is directed to anyone who is against war.  Catch-22 is also directed to anyone who wants a laugh.  In his novel, Catch-22, Joseph Heller successfully portrays an anti-war masterpiece using humor, corruption, and hope. <br />In order for someone to fully understand Catch-22, he or she must understand the context of the novel.  This novel was written in the 1950's.  This was a time where many Americans viewed World War II as a heroic success.  Those involved in the combat had differing views on the subject.  Joseph Heller was a bombardier for the Air Force during World War II.  Catch-22 is based largely on Heller's experiences in the war.  Through his novel, Heller is expressing his detest for war.  An element that one must take into account when reading Heller's novel is that he wrote Catch-22 using extreme satire.  The reader must not take everything written seriously or he or she will not grasp the message Heller is trying to convey.<br />Heller's novel Catch-22 revolves primarily around the actions and feelings of the protagonist, Yossarian.  Yossarian desperately wants to be grounded.  He can't be grounded though because he asked to be.  Since he asked to be grounded that proved that he was indeed sane.  If a man was insane he would want to fly more missions, therefore he could be grounded.  Even if a man were insane and decided to ask to be grounded he could not be since he askedto be grounded therefore proving that he is actually sane.  The preceding passage describes Catch-22.  \\""Doc Daneeka replied, `Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy\\"" (55).  Yossarian spends most of the novel faking illnesses and finding other ways to get out of flying.  It is near the end of the novel when Yossarian takes a walk through the eternal city of Rome.  Yossarian is in Nately's whore's apartment with all of the girls (prostitutes) missing except for one old lady.  This lady explains another aspect of Catch-22. \\""Catch-22 says they have the right to do anything we can't stop them from doing\\"" (417). The woman is referring to how the soldiers came and took all of the girls from the apartment.  Once the woman says this to Yossarian he realizes that Catch-22 doesn't truly exist.  It is an inexistent rule used to control people.  After Yossarian realizes this he retreats to the city where he sees all of the horrors of the world.  It is in Rome where he is arrested for being in the city without a pass.  After he is arrested, Colonel Cathcart and Colonel Korn gave Yossarian a proposal.  They will send him back to the States if he pretends to promote the war. \\""Be our pal. Say nice thing about us here and back in the States. Become one of the boys. Now, that isn't asking too much, is it?\\"" (436).  Yossarian accepts the proposal but breaks it.  He cannot promote the war effort.  Instead Yossarian decides to run away to Sweden.  Yossarian runs because he can no longer be controlled and is ready to live a life of freedom.<br />There is no doubt to whether Heller successfully executed his goals in writing this novel.  It is evident through his writing that Heller truly detested the war and everything about it.  He successfully uses humor in discussing a controversial issue.  Catch-22 suggests many problems within the United States Militia.  One of these problems is the traumatic affect of combat on soldiers.  This idea is present through Yossarian and Snowden.  Snowden was a young bombardier who died in Yossarian's arms.  In result, Yossarian is always having flashbacks to the moment of Snowden's death.  Although Heller's novel covered many issues it didn't touch on many common themes within war novels.  One idea that is not present in Heller's writing in patriotism.  None of the men in the novel act like they are fighting for their country. They don't show pride in what they do.  This can be expected though since it is an anti-war novel.  Heller distinguishes himself from other anti- war novelists in the sense of style.  Unlike others, Heller uses satire to express his feelings on war.  <br />Although Heller's novel is entertaining and comical I don't entirely agree with his stance on issues regarding war.  Through his writing Heller seems to find everything about war to be wrong.  I personally feel that war is indeed wrong but is essential at crucial times.  It seems as though Heller feels war is the worse thing on the face of the earth.<br />In his novel, Catch-22, Joseph Heller successfully displays his beliefs on war.  He touches on ideas such as corruption, deception, and violence in his novel.  Heller was one of the first people to write an anti-war novel and did so even though he was a former member of the Air Force.  Heller uses satire magnificently to illuminate on certain idiotic aspects of war.  Catch-22 is a masterpiece of literature and everyone owes it to themselves to read it.",2004-03-19

Yossarian, the protagonist, was a World War II Bombardier. In the novel, for thousands of people that didn't even know kept trying to kill him. This book I believe helps people to understand the meanings and feelings of war. For Yossarian lost several of his friends in war, bizzare accidnets, or even by fate, but he had to learn to handle it. This novel is not like every other novel, for it has no chronological order to it which gives it its uniqueness not only to the novel but also to the characters. For example, Yossarian goes crazy because he has gone through a lot but he gets through it. Major Major is a character to which he tells everyone they may visit him in his office, when he's not there. Some characters like Colonal Korn's just wants his picture in the paper and doesn't even care about his soldier or if they get bombed or anything. Heller makes the novel very interesting, but it is self-contradicting and has twisted reasoning for everything. He wants the reader to have to go back in the novel and remember certain events in order for it all to make sense. I also believe that because of all the little stories told about the other characters and the realationship Yossarian has with them, it ends up showing the reader a lot about Yossarian himself. For this novel is fun to read because it is field with numerous amounts of emotions from humor, to scary, to sadness and depressing moments allowing the reader to really get into the book. I enjoyed this book a lot, because I was able to keep reading it because I didn't want to put it down. I wanted to find out what kind of event was going to happen next.

The novel is set in the closing months of the Second World War, on a little island off the coast of Italy. Heller skillfully depicts a generation of people who are used against their will and the sheer helplessness of their resistance to the system. What makes this piece of literature so clever is how Heller uses his characters, which seem so real, to create many instances of contradiction and questionable logic. For example, Major Major, who will only see people in his office he himself is not in it. Or Commanding Officers who care more about well shot aerial photographs of bomb targets than actually bombing the target. And the most twisted contradiction of all: the main character's (Yossarian) iron will to survive the war, or die trying.<BR>The novel stays fresh by unfolding many side stories that involve Yossarian's relationship with other characters. This, of course, tells the reader more about the men in the Bomber Division, but it also reveals more about Yossarian himself and his attempts to get himself out of as many missions as possible. Other characters present many of the recurring themes in the novel, such as faith. The division's chaplain, Chaplain Tappman, spends all his time preaching from the Good Book in hospitals and to the men, but at the same time, doubts everything he says, and the Lord's existence. Also, Yossarian's superior officers reveal the absolute weakness of language: while it offers no reassurance to those facing death, or those who could meet it, it offers the power of officers to trap their men in a hopeless prison of the army or in a grander scheme of things, bureaucracy. <BR>By the time I finished this book, I was again presented with another contradiction: while this book is serious, sad, and incredibly thought-provoking, it's quite the funny read.",2004-02-16

As Yossarian loses more of his friends to enemy fire, bizarre accidents and strange twists of fate, the storyline becomes ever more convoluted and the characters ever more bizarre.<br />At its heart, this book is about how soldiers handle war. How they justify their actions and how they live with the constant threat of death or injury. Heller illustrates the confusion and senselessness of war by using bizarre events and crooked logic. The book is filled with black humor and quickly moves from one outlandish event to the next.<br />In my opinion, this book has two major weaknesses. The first, is one of the hallmarks of this book: Heller builds his sentences to suggest an idea, only to immediately contradict himself. I found this to be very amusing for the first 100 pages or so, but this style simply became tedious afterwards. The second problem is the book's non-chronological plot. Heller keeps skipping back and forth in time and this makes the book hard to read and the plot difficult to follow.<br />I found the book's real strength to be in its amazing and phenomenally well developed characters. Yossarian, Doc. Daneeka, Orr, Major Major and many more, are all extraordinarily alive and yet fundamentally flawed. <br />Did I enjoy this book? Yes.

About 10 years later, I recently picked up the book again to finish a book I have been wanting to finish.  I was not disappointed.  Joseph Heller is a skilled story teller whose pen is well adept to writing satire.  Many of the humorous points of this book I was not ready to appreciate as a high school senior.  Years later, I found myself laughing out at many lines in this book.<br />The book tells the story of Yossarian, a disgruntled World War II pilot.  Yossarian wants nothing more than to go home from the war after his mission quota is satisfied.  Unfortunately, his mission quota is raised each time he gets close to meeting it.  Along the way, we meet a cast of unique characters.  It makes me curious as to where Heller came up with the idea for all these characters.  Lieutenant Scheisskopf and Major Major Major Major are two of my favorite characters in the book.  Their stories in addition to the idiosyncrasies are wonderfully written.  The book ends with Yossarian faced with a paradox of choices based on the development of the character.  It is worth reading the book to find out the ending.<br />This book is a literary classic.  I hate to give too many points of the plot away in the review as I would hope the sharp turns in the plot can surpise other readers the way they surprised me.

The nonlinear style annoys me. <br />I stuck with it, and before you know it, it all comes together.  That is the key.  If you stick with it and not try to understand every single detail, or read every dialogue like you are some deep, intospective English teacher, it can be a lot of fun.

It is supposed to sound absurd to you. Heller is sarcastically demonstrating the reality of war profiteering.

Oh well, there's a lesson to be learned here somewhere.<br />    &quot;Catch 22&quot; is considered a classic but in my mind &quot;classics&quot; are books of the caliber of &quot;1984&quot; or &quot;Brave New World&quot; or &quot;The Stand&quot;, books that hold up in time and deliver their message in a way that isnt anachronistic. &quot;Catch 22&quot; does not belong in such an &quot;elite&quot; category. <BR>   It's supposedly &quot;hilarious&quot; but that's a very emphatic statement to make about humour and, hmm, i hardly laughed with it. Sure, humour is (as are many concepts) just a matter of perspective but from my angle of the world this was hardly enough to make you grin. Another paradox is that many readers claim you &quot;have to be well read&quot; to like this or (even stranger) you &quot;have to read this if you want to be well read&quot;.<BR>  This is absolutely untrue. What is actually true is that the more you've read the less the chances become you'll be thrilled by &quot;Catch 22&quot; and if you are not &quot;well read&quot; (which is hard to define anyway) &quot;Catch 22&quot; wont add too much to your thinking arsenal except in my opinion the obvious.<BR>   <BR>    So what is the obvious here?<br />   Heller goes into an overlengthy diatribe to deliver an antiwar message decorated with philosophy bits and some provocative thoughts. While he tries to bring forth the insanity of war he does so by using incredibly underdeveloped characters, a totally ineffective plot (if one can call this a plot) and humour that tries to be subtle sarcasm but fails completely as:<BR>   -if it's subtle i`t's so subtle it's almost invisible, and<BR>   - if it's sarcasm it's so harmless that it causes little concern to its targets.<br />I wont go into the story or the characters as many other reviewers have covered that in 1000s of reviews here. What i will add is this: &quot;Catch 22&quot; is painfully boring to read, it becomes almost a task as you go through the first 50-100 pages and you find the same concepts over and over repeated and what is supposed to be a &quot;storyline&quot; thinnning continuously until it almost dissapears. If all &quot;classics&quot; were like this my take is that literature could easily become mental torture.<br />   What i find even sadder is that Heller fails while actually delivering an important message. This only drives home the fact that you might have the right thoughts but this doesnt mean you can express them in a literary way. Heller would be probably better off had he written a straight philosophical book which would have been way more in his element. As it is he takes a shot at literature and doesnt miss as he hits the target head on and the victim expires.<BR>   All a matter of perspective as i said, but i would advise you to take a good look at both the negative and the positive reviews about &quot;Catch 22&quot; before you decide whether to read it or not. You'll be surprised how completely contradicting they are. Hilarious and boring dont exactly go together. If, however, you do go on and read it dont be surprised if you find that you're forcing yourself through it.",2003-12-09

Virtually any praise that I can heap upon Catch-22 has been done - and more eloquently than I can ever put it. From a humanistic standpoint it is a far-reaching work touching on subjects which can be deemed universal, even given the extreme circumstances placed upon the characters; though most of us have never even smelled the smokey aroma of a bullet fired at our heads, let alone experienced the horror of war (as far-removed, history-channel watching observers like my self so inadequately put it), Heller smashes, with remarkable insight, care and an almost scary gift for paradoxical logic, into subjects which touch any person with the right-minded patience to plough through this massive novel.<br />As a work of philosophy (yes, philosophy), Catch-22 visits realms of logic that will twist the reader's mind while making him realize the idiosyncracies in war, indeed in everyday life. There is a reason why the term 'Catch-22' is now a commonly used expression; the book puts a name on a set of logical impasses that had been hinted at before but never officially named. (perhaps by philosophers, yes, but never in such a popular way)<br />As a work of literature, this book is simply amazing. A testament to the nearly 10 years Heller plunked down into its writing, Catch-22 is easily the most complex and convoluted novel I have ever read which still manages to keep some semblance of sense and cohesiveness. I cannot even begin to imagine the intense plotting and forethought that has gone into its execution; moments hinted at briefly which seem absolutely meaningless resurface 300 pages later and shed new light on everything up to that point. It of course follows suit that this novel needs more than one reading, indeed, needs more than two.<br />Catch-22 is an extremely important work of art, not only for the generation it was written for, but for humanity as a whole, for its complexity, unabashed humanity, trenchant humor (even all these years later), mad geniusand the sheer pleasure it provides in revisiting (the second lecture is much better than the first.)<br />It is difficult to expound on Heller's genius for having writen this gem within the confines of 1000 words or less, and I usually take with healthy suspicion such raving reviews as I myself have given, but it is duly deserving. If I had to compress Catch-22 into a word, it would be 'timeless'.

(How many German and Italian soldiers were facists at heart?  Most, I reckon, were young and impressionable and filled with fear over what would happen to them if they refused to fight.)<br />Of course, WWII was an unavoidable war, one we fought bravely and righteously -- Heller's novel doesn't openly dispute that.  What &quot;Catch-22&quot; does in a groundbreaking way, though, is point a spotlight on some of the absurd, from-the-top-down, morally questionable and out-of-public-view actions of war that lead to innocent men, women and children (on both sides of the border) suffering and of course dying.  Some of these actions -- repeatedly upping the required number of missions after the quota's been met, using military connections and materiel in the act of selling or trading black market goods for private profit, war-related corporate benefits, private goals of officers that involve men going in harm's way -- may be more associated with our conflicts in Vietnam and Iraq than WWII.<br />The only valor in this novel exists in the idea of getting out alive; after all, the enemies are not the Germans so much as the commanding officers.  Interpreted more deeply, &quot;Catch-22&quot; could be considered a comment on corporate structure and the use of men as pawns in the top-level games played by the players and power brokers of America.  (For more on that subject, see &quot;Life Askew,&quot; available at Amazon.com.)<br />The first 100 pages of &quot;Catch-22&quot; is a series of character sketches, some hilarious, some maddening -- there's a very stream-of-consciousness aspect to what little narrative structure exists.

Indeed, this is probably less a novel about warfare, as it is a novel that comments on all American extremes including extreme pride, extreme capitalism and extreme bureaucracy. Heller may be a gadfly and he may be too cute at times (my only significant complaint about his style) but it is undeniable that he often has a point. It is easy to commiserate with Yossarian.

I'm going to go ahead and base this review on my first reading with the qualification that the book may not hold up quite as well on multiple readings.<br />The first time through, however, I was blown away.  This book is really not like anything else I'd ever read.  I know that statement sounds cliche, but it was true for me.  Joseph Heller invents an entirely new prism through which to view the world, and I suspect the humour and zaniness in this novel will either work or not work for readers based on personal taste.  It worked for me, and after reading it, the only thing I could think of was what had prevented me from reading it sooner.<br />Actually, my wife couldn't wait until I was done with the book, because at times I was in such a black mood while reading it.  That's not a criticism of the book but rather a testament to Heller's skill as an author.  He so perfectly controls the story that you will have tears of laughter rolling down your face one moment and a sick feeling in your stomach another as the story moves effortlessly from rollicking comedy to horrific tragedy.  <br />I won't bother trying to summarize the plot or characters.  I have read other comments that criticize Heller for not inventing developed characters, which I suppose is a justified criticism.  Many of them have a cartoonish quality and exist solely for the purposes of making a point or moving the plot along.  However, they're not totally devoid of depth, because when a character dies, I felt genuinely moved and actually mourned the loss.

For one, glory and honor are not depicted as characteristics of soldiers who are in combat. Yossarian isn't exactly on the front line, like Paul in All Quiet on the Western Front, and his ability to go to Rome allows the reader to see that although combat missions are forced onto him, he is still a human being. He is not like a character that is so engrossed in the war whose condition is difficult for the average person to comprehend. Yossarian shows you his life, his inability to ensure himself survival, and the utter irony of war. The novel is captivating and evokes many different emotions: laughter, tension, shock, and sadness. There were many instances when I laughed and at the same time realized the horror of Yossarian's life.

It tells the beautifully unstructured-structured tale of a young man, Yossarian, grappling with the illogic of morality and self-preservation. The novel is anti-etsblishment in that it asks readers to always consider their actions before giving their blind allegiance (Milo's syndicate, the glorious loyalty oath crusade) to that which is spoon-fed to them. Stark, shocking and profound in its portrayal of its society of men (and, in perhaps its only, exceedingly minor, flaw, only men), Catch-22 draws readers in, keeps them hanging on every word, and never forgets to evoke emotion, moving from humor to pity and fear, realizing the tragedy of life and death.<br />While many have criticized the novel for its non-linear approach, Heller's structure, syntax (including some of the most amazing sentences I think I've ever read) and language prove the man to be a master. The novel loops back upon itself, returning to heartrending scenes, subtly revealing more each time in its use of diction. Snowden's death is the clearest example of such treatment in the work, only fully complete as the book reaches its truly thrilling conclusion (I'm definitely not going to spoil any of the ending by telling you more--just read it!). Catch-22 is a novel that you can't put down, no matter howyou try; characters and storylines all fall into place as you move from the novel's confusion to its own type of enlightenment (particularly in these troubling times)--stick with it, enjoy, learn and take a break from the novel (for I don't think one ever truly \\""leaves\\"" it) a better person...you'll thank yourself for it.",2003-06-16

The book is about what it is like to be an American pilot in another country during the war.  Yossarian, who is the main character of the book, is basically a very crazy person just because of all the experiences he has had with war.  He has seen so many of his friend die that he does not want to fly on any other missions because he thinks that he will die.  He is very nervous as to what will happen in the future, so he basically goes into the hospital so he does not have to go on any other missions.  One of the main problems is that the number of required missions keeps getting raised, which means for him that he will be stuck there until he gets them done, but he does not want to go on another mission and refuses.  <BR> During the book, Yossarian comes up with many plans to help him get out of the war and to get back home.  All of the plans that he makes up, always get destroyed because of catch 22.  Catch 22 is a kind of statement or rule that the men in the war have come up with for certain circumstances they are put under.  Every time he tries to get out of the war, there is always someone or something that is stopping him, and that is the catch.  Eventually toward the end of the book, some of the higher ranked men ask him to fly the less dangerous missions, and they will have other men fly the dangerous ones in his place.  He still disagrees with this because he does not want the men to be put in a spot where they see the same that he has seen.  This is Yossarians main problem in the book.  He wants to save all of the men in the war from dying or from seeing the horrible sights of the war that he has seen.  This would mean that in order for Yossarian to save the men is for him to fly the dangerous missions.  Every time he flies the missions, he is getting more insane because he is putting himself in the places that the other men would die in.  This for him is self sacrifice, and thatis what is making him so insane throughout the book.<BR> During the book, Joseph Heller, the author, does a great job in explaining the circumstances and events that happen in war.  He does a very great job in describing all of the characters and how they all feel.  He also relates all of the feelings of the characters, to the real life feelings that people would have while in war.  The main theme of the story is that Yossarian has to sacrifice himself in order to save the other men in the war.  This is the problem, because it makes him more insane throughout the book, but in order for him to save the men, he is forced to choose one of the two things that are put in front of him, and that is the catch.  Throughout the book overall, Yossarian has himself caught between two things that are both bad for him.  So overall, the theme of this book gives a good idea as to what can happen to a man that is put in the horrible consequences of war.  I think that the overall book is very well written, because the author can make the reader feel sad about the war one minute, and happy about it the next, and that is what is so great about the book.",2003-05-20

He had always run away from the missions, he never dropped bombs, he just got the air hours on his record.  He hated being in the army and wanted to leave, he did not want to die.  Yet after his friend died he decided to help hid friends and run away.  <BR> <BR> For most of the book Yossarian is a patient in a military hospital.  All he does when he is there is pick on the staff and other patients.  But when his friend Orr picks on Yossarian he gets mad, but never defends himself.   He is afraid to die.  When he is in the hospital he acts like everyone is out to kill him and thinks that all the people in the hospital are crazy.<br /> I think Yossarian was a capable person who got in his own way when he tried to do anything.   He would run from his responsibilities instead of facing them.  At the end of the book he proved to himself that he was running from his responsibilities and finally ran toward them.  He faced his responsibilities by going to help his friends when he rejected an offer that he had been asking for because he didn't wantto lie.  Until then he had been a very selfish man and only wanted to save himself and his close friends in the process.<br /> I think that this book was too long and that it could have been better in less words.

He is a scared, weak drunk who hates being a bomber in the war. He is afraid of dying and does anything in his power to not have fly missions. He faked a liver problem and went to the hospital for a few weeks to just relax, hit on the nurses and talk to other patients. One time he even faked being someone else dying and talked to the guys family just so the doctor wouldnt tell that Yossarian wasnt actually sick. Heller portrays the whole unit Yossarian is in and everyone he meets to be sort of odd and a little crazy. Most the captains and people of rank are alcoholics and do something to take advantage of their positions in the military. For example Major de Coverly kidnaps Italian laborers and goes to cities to get apartments for officers and enlisted men to go on leaves. The main purpose of these leaves is to visit prostitutes and get drunk. I feel that Heller portrays everyone in the book to be a joke, and I think he shows his feelings about war through these characters.<BR> Catch 22 is a good book but a confusing one you need to pay attention to all the characters because they all seem to have a story to go along with them and in some way they connect to Yossarian. Heller furthers the complexity by jumping from character to character and from scene to scene. Catch 22 is a funny novel with a lot of good humor about life and the war.",2003-05-20

This is true, for the writing is very different, and it is at times very hard to follow the story. But, if you can find it within your heart to forgive Catch-22 that minor misgiving, then you certainly would feel the same way about it that I do that Catch-22 is a very good book.<BR> There are several characters in the book, but the one that Catch-22 is rooted to is Yossarian, who throughout the whole book is always wondering why people he has never met are trying to kill him. His wondering why leads him to try to leave the army in any way possible, but he is always confronted with \\""catch-22\\"", which in his case means he can leave the army if he is crazy, and he must be crazy to fly the dangerous bombing runs, but, and here's the catch, \\""anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy...that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind\\"". Catch-22 is used in different situation throughout the book, each with its own underling meaning.<BR> A major point the book conveys is the line between sanity and insanity. As seen by the \\""catch-22\\"" for Yossarian, it seems to us he is really crazy, for who would walk around all day for months naked. Yet, after getting into the book, the reader comes to realize Yossarian is the only sane person in the whole outfit. This new idea of  those who are crazy are sane, and visa versa, leads in to the theme of the later half of the book, the stupidity of  army politics. During the story, there are countless times when idiotic things occur because the ones in charge fell it necessary. For instance, in a mission that a member of Yossarian's crew is killed, Yossarian gets a metal. <BR> With what I have said, you can see how the book is confusing at times. But don't let that scare you away. Catch-22 is one of the best books of the 20th century, and it is also a very funny book. I recommendit to any who are willing to try something new, for Catch-22 is a challenge, and what could be better for to read than a challenging book full, of humor, about a war...kind of reminds me of \\""M.A.S.H.\\"", but not as serious.",2003-05-16

But the funny thing is they get by because they know that they are going to have to live with each other for a while, which leads to a state of depression in the squadron.    <BR> <BR>But the only thing that Yossarian wants to do is get out of the military and go home.  Yossarian gets very angry with people because he doesn't want anyone bugging him because he is a man that likes to be alone and stay in his own world which is shown by isolation.  A sign of isolation shown on this book is when Yossarian always has some sort of problem with himself.  This is shown by isolation because he is a man that is very lonely and wants to get out the military.  Catch-22 makes Yossarian feel very depressed because the military always bumps up the missions needed to leave the base.  So Yossarian always goes off on his own because he knows that he will be there for a while.  <br />Another sign of isolationism is when all the people in the book become incoherent because they are unsure of what to do to make themselves get along with one another.  This is isolationism because they take it out on other people while making themselves feel bad about how they are going to live the rest of their lives and at the same time taking their problems out on other people.  <BR> I believe this book should be read because it offers a lot of action and humor.  The men in the squadron are always fighting with each other but somehow they always seem to pull it off and get along in the end.  It also offers a lot of drama because when Yossarian's roommate dies many people are effected by it and don't know how to deal with it.  But at time the book can be boring because it rambles on about describing when Clevenger says how Yossarain is crazy.  It goes on for about a page and a half.  That is the only boring part of the book.  All round I thought it was a book that offered a lot of information on what war life was like at that time.",2003-05-16

These are just a few examples of the roundabout logic, self-defeating reasoning, and frustrating paradoxes that infest the text of Catch-22. Set in final months of World War II, Joseph Heller's novel depicts a world where the human language has become obsolete. Hardly a single exchange takes place that doesn't contain some form of self-contradiction or circular reasoning. Heller's stories of the horrors of war are a satire that is at one-moment whimsical and acidic the next.<BR>        Featuring an abundant cast of memorable characters, Catch-22 is a war novel that is much more. It is an allegory, a collection of running themes and recurring storylines. Told in a nonlinear storytelling style, Heller's novel captivates and demands attention, making reference to events in casual passing, only to return to them in increased detail. During an education session in Chapter 4, Yossarian, the book's protagonist, makes passing reference to Snowden, a man killed during a mission in which he was in charge. This incident is returned to with increasing detail as the story progresses, and it is in the book's blood-drenched climax that the full horrors of the event are recounted. <BR> One recurring theme in Heller's novel is faith. The character Chaplain Tappman is the ideal vehicle for Heller's musings; he constantly preaches the word of God, questioning The Almighty's existence all the while. On the subject of the bible, Tappman recalls one soldier asking, \\""Did it indeed seem probable...that the answers to the riddles of creation would be supplied by people too ignorant to understand the mechanics of rainfall?\\"" Yossarian also offers his two cents on the matter in Chapter 18, referring to a certain Supreme Being as \\""'a colossal, immortal blunderer,'\\"" saying, \\""'When you consider the opportunity and power He had to really do a job, and then look at the stupid, ugly mess He made of it instead, His sheer incompetence is almost staggering. It's obvious he never met a payroll. Why, no self-respecting businessman would hire a bungler like Him as even a shipping clerk!'\\"" Its insights like these that make Catch-22 the joy it is.<BR> This questioning of faith and religion is justified, particularly in the environment of war, where ruthlessness and corruption are the status quo. Heller creates a world where a redeeming character is a rare and unusual blessing. Many of the book's characters are so self-absorbed it's a wonder how they came to men of respected standing in the first place. Colonel Cathcart, one of the story's central antagonists, is a prime example. A brown-nosing, elitist, social climber, He cares more about getting his picture into the next edition of the Saturday Evening Post than the well-being of his own men. If it weren't for the characters' military titles, one would hardly know this was a book about war at all. Heller doesn't glorify war or hold it on a pedestal, and it is through this jaded perspective that his reader begins to understand what war is really about. <BR> By the end of Catch-22, I had been run through a full gamut of emotions. I laughed at the irrational interrogation of Chaplain Tappman in Chapter 36, and I felt a sickness in the pit of my sickness as Yossarian witnessed poverty, death, and desperation wandering through The Eternal City in Chapter 39.

The book is about what it is like to be an American pilot in another country during the war.  Yossarian, who is the main character of the book, is basically a very crazy person just because of all the experiences he has had with war.  He has seen so many of his friend die that he does not want to fly on any other missions because he thinks that he will die.  He is very nervous as to what will happen in the future, so he basically goes into the hospital so he does not have to go on any other missions.  One of the main problems is that the number of required missions keeps getting raised, which means for him that he will be stuck there until he gets them done, but he does not want to go on another mission and refuses.  <BR> During the book, Yossarian comes up with many plans to help him get out of the war and to get back home.  All of the plans that he makes up, always get destroyed because of catch 22.  Catch 22 is a kind of statement or rule that the men in the war have come up with for certain circumstances they are put under.  Every time he tries to get out of the war, there is always someone or something that is stopping him, and that is the catch.  Eventually toward the end of the book, some of the higher ranked men ask him to fly the less dangerous missions, and they will have other men fly the dangerous ones in his place.  He still disagrees with this because he does not want the men to be put in a spot where they see the same that he has seen.  This is Yossarians main problem in the book.  He wants to save all of the men in the war from dying or from seeing the horrible sights of the war that he has seen.  This would mean that in order for Yossarian to save the men is for him to fly the dangerous missions.  Every time he flies the missions, he is getting more insane because he is putting himself in the places that the other men would die in.  This for him is self sacrifice, and thatis what is making him so insane throughout the book.<BR> During the book, Joseph Heller, the author, does a great job in explaining the circumstances and events that happen in war.  He does a very great job in describing all of the characters and how they all feel.  He also relates all of the feelings of the characters, to the real life feelings that people would have while in war.  The main theme of the story is that Yossarian has to sacrifice himself in order to save the other men in the war.  This is the problem, because it makes him more insane throughout the book, but in order for him to save the men, he is forced to choose one of the two things that are put in front of him, and that is the catch.  Throughout the book overall, Yossarian has himself caught between two things that are both bad for him.  So overall, the theme of this book gives a good idea as to what can happen to a man that is put in the horrible consequences of war.  I think that the overall book is very well written, because the author can make the reader feel sad about the war one minute, and happy about it the next, and that is what is so great about the book.",2003-05-13

Then there is the great leader Cathcart who freely volunteers his men for missions all the time.  There is also the fact that the war heroes of this book are so flawed in their own character.  Or when we think of war heroes, we do not think of the trauma people go through in war.

The in-depth analysis of peoples' view of gain for only themselves made Catch-22 destined for success from the very beginning.  <BR>The story is that of a bomber pilot, Yossarian, who endures the hardships of fighting the war.

Regardless of what those feelings may be, they will most likely be strengthened after reading this book. It is sometimes considered an anti-war book, but anyone who disagrees with that would probably consider it honest and comical. The main character Yossarian is not fond of war. He learns early on that the real &quot;catch&quot; is that a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to participate in the missions, not if he requests to leave. Anyone who is smart enough to request to go home proves their sanity. Yossarian spends the entire novel trying to think of ways to be relieved of his duties. He just barely escapes a couple of opportunities to be sent home, which only adds to the several elements of humor, satire and irony. <BR>I read &quot;Catch 22&quot; for a high school assignment, expecting it to be another serious and dramatic book similar to the majority of the works I have read throughout high school. It is basically the opposite. I wish it had be required reading because it introduces elements of humor and irony that many students have not been introduced to in works of literary merit. It evokes many questions, sometimes deep and philosophical, sometimes trivial, of the true meanings of life and war. I would've loved to have many class discussions about this book because each student would have different views and opinions to share.<BR>While I don't consider it the best book ever, it certainly is enjoyable.

Catch-22 is an hilarious book, one of the most funny books I have ever read, but it goes far beyond that.  While reading the novel, the most wide range of emotions will be felt by the reader.  You'll laugh at the escapades of Yossarian and his squadron with prostitutes in Rome.

Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is one such novel.  Set toward the end of World War II, the book follows a very vague plot line with a strange way of representing time but uses abundant, rich, and sometimes a little dark humor to weave an enthralling tale about the bombardier Yossarian and his struggle against reality, particularly the fact that he has to fly in a plane (with people whom he has never even met before shooting at him) just because he is told to.  <BR> The book is well written and it draws you (the reader) in by really relating you to the myriad characters and their unique quirks.  There is little historical accuracy in this book and some things are so wrong that its downright funny, for example Milo Minderbinder's mess hall syndicate (M&M) which, run by a lowly mess officer, trades with countries and organizations all over the world (including Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia) turning a prophet using confusing tangles of twisted logic and the magic slogan \\""everyone has a share.\\""  The humor is by far the book's most prominent strength but the writing is a close second.  The astoundingly detailed and descriptive prose makes the funny parts all the more zany and the heavy, semi-depressing parts so vivid and powerful that they are extremely moving at times.

The main plot is focused around the story of Yossarian, one of the many soldiers on the island.  Yossarian is different from many of the men stationed there as he takes the war personally and gets annoyed that he has to be there, facing danger everyday.  He continually tries to find ways to get out of the war and go home, but every plan he comes up with always has a catch, catch-22.  This catch ruins all his plans and makes them seem illogical.  Throughout the novel Yossarian has to fight against everyone to gain back his life and get what he wants.  <BR>I enjoyed this novel because of the serious yet satirical tone that is used to convey the major theme. Heller used humor to make the book less controversial and to entertain the reader, while trying to make a statement.  He also dealt with a very serious subject matter, the topic of war, which everyone has differing views on.  He discusses the fighting and death that occurs in any war and is very graphic in his descriptions of what happens, but through being straightforward and blunt, Heller makes a stronger statement about war and its brutality.  The descriptions affected me and my heart went out to all the soldiers involved in the war. Then, when Heller brought the humor back in I began to laugh out loud at the experiences he discussed.  I truly enjoyed the way Heller wrote the novel and found that the mix of humor with the serious topic of war worked well to convey his message and made the novel truly original.<BR>The novel does not only discuss war and cannot just be considered an anti-war novel.  The novel can relate to any aspect of human life and make sense in almost any situation, making it a universal novel.  The issues that Catch-22 deals with are issues and emotions every person has confronted at one time or another, such as anger, loss, pain, determination and selfishness.  All the characters have to overcome these emotions if they want to survive the war and make it in the world.  <BR>I found Catch-22 to be an excellent novel about gaining your own freedom and becoming your own person and enjoyed the fact that it used such a controversial and universal topic as war to convey that message.  <BR>A great read for anyone.",2003-05-01

I think the greatest thing about this novel is that Heller, in about 90% of the novel, seems unconcerned with passing judgement and instead chooses to give us the raw reality of these characters and lets the rest be decided by the reader.<br />Heller creates a chaotic athmosphere filled by exotic characters that are never censored. The narrative is consistently odd but it never seems to stray too far from its purpose, or plot. The first three quarters of the book are hillarious, followed by a somber, pensative tone completely brutal and unforgiving.

The fact that i couldn't take my eyes from the page to admire the surreal postcard display before me has to say something about this book. I stayed up til four each morning because i never wanted to stop reading. This is just ONE OF THOSE BOOKS. Heller's vision is of such a complete story, a beyond-history, where events are visited and revisited and new light is shed on them, but the omnipotent power of the author is felt in the filtering of accurate details throughout. I just found Heller's control over his narrative mesmerising. Aside from this structural point, Catch-22 would be nothing without its characters. I don't remember ever delighting so much in the exploits of so many characters. An entire air-force base, virutally, is evoked in chapter after chapter of brilliant scenes and funny histories.<br />Watch out for: Hungry Joe, Major Major, Milo, Orr, Doc Daneeka, The Chaplain, Sheissekopf, aw heck, i won't list the rest, but they're all good!<br />Particularly relevant now, and in any time of war in the future (sadly, the fact is inevitable), is Heller's portrayal of the madness of war. Anyone can say it, anyone can glorify it, but Heller was actually there. He served as a bombadier (Yossarian, his protagonist, does too). But its not just the war, its any government, any big business, any SYSTEM, which oppresses you, beats you into submission and makes you do its dirty work at the expense of your life love and liberty. The SYSTEM that you can't escape from, no matter what - and as soon as you want to escape, it uses this against you to shackle you back to it again.<br />Despite this, though, like other truly great books, you don't get the sense of being badgered by it. You laugh along with the third-person narrator and you read about characters and story. You don't ever feel that you're getting a book of straight ideas: always a dry, suffocating thing. He isn't telling us a anything, he isn't teachingus anything, he's showing us something - and allowing us to make of it what we will. Heller has made a book with an overriding theme, a satirical novel, but he hasn't written another Bible. He presents a situation, he doesn't pretend to have all the answers. The only thing he knows for sure, is that war doesn't solve anything.<br />There are no words to describe the sort of funny Heller's book is, except maybe laugh-out-loud. I don't remember laughing so much at a book.<br />Like Catcher in the Rye, Catch-22 is a book which will make you feel throughout and after you're finished both happy and sad: happy that a book like this exists, though shocked that it fell into your hands, but sad over the fact that you doubt you'll ever find another as good.<br />If in doubt, though, try Vladamir Nabokov's Lolita and Catcher in the Rye.

The man he saks is Doc Daneeka, who wallows in his own self pity. Doc Daneeka answered Yossarian saying, \\""Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy\\""(55).

It's almost as if each flashback is it's own little story, mkaing it hard to follow any kind of rising action.<br />As much as this book is recommended, I would ask readers to stay clear of it.

I imagine many people are that type of person.  I am not.<br />For me, the problem with Catch-22 was that Heller never developed the characters in a way that made me like or dislike or otherwise feel a certain way about them.  Most of his descriptions of the characters focused on superficial qualities; he hardly developed the *character* of the characters (other than Major Major) at all.<br />These superficial traits, however, do not have universal appeal.  Different people have different opinions of these superficial qualities, and my opinions are evidently very different from Heller's.<br />Take General Peckem.  It was obvious that Peckem was supposed to be the epitome of annoying characters in the novel, based on his name alone.  Yet, when we finally met him, I hardly found him annoying at all.  In fact, I found him rather efficient.<br />Maybe there's a certain honesty about not presenting characters in a way designed to influence the reason's opinion of them.  But Catch-22 is a satire, and a satire depends on the reader feeling a certain way about the characters.  Much of the satire didn't work for me because I didn't share Heller's feelings about the charaters.<br />Now, having said all that, I will say that I think most people, especially military and other action types, will share Heller's opinions, and will understand the satire.<br />The other problem I had with Catch-22 is it's lack of temporal continuity.  It seemed that you could read most of the chapters in the book in any order and it would make just as much sense, which is not much.

The context of the story follows Yossarian's various crazy attempts to escape the hellhole he is trapped in, as well as the insane antics of the other soldiers in his squadron and the numerous backstabbings and alliances that occur. By the time you reach the middle of the book, you'll be questioning if there is even one sane man in the entire squadron.<br />That is the surface look. When you look underneath that, Heller has taken all the loopholes and injustices of the military and served them up for any somewhat intelligent person to see and therefore to use, in order that they won't get themselves caught up in a net of contradictions and lies, essentially falling into the all American trap of joining the military. (Little did Heller know how many young men would do just that less than 20 years later in Vietnam.)<br />However, that is still not all. Under this second skin of the military lies an even deeper message that goes even beyond how distrustful and wicked the military can be, and that is the horrid truth that establishments all across the globe are using the same twisted procedures and insanely irrational rules to keep those who are a part of it in check. The fact that there is not only one message hidden under the surface of theplot, but an even deeper one embedded in that is truly genius, and I do not use that word lightly.<br />With the universal truth about establishments and their catch-22's (essentially a lose-lose situation), there are also many other messages in tow throughout the novel about the morality, decency, and existence of man. The chapter titled \\""Nately's Old Man\\"" serves up a decent argument about war and the ultimate future of America and hereby all nations, and the chilling chapter \\""Snowden\\"" brings the entire existence of man into question in a disturbing scene taking place during the death of a soldier on board a plane.

I'd like to add that a classic is often praised now because it was praised in the past. Some classics are timeless and can make their point in any period, but others are useful for a certain amount of time then lose their effectiveness. \\""Catch-22\\"" clearly falls into the second category. When this book was written back in the 50's it was necessary to give the world a reaction to the mythology of World War II. The soldiers in the war were still being worshipped as perfect humans with a perfect love for their country and unlimited bravery and courage to save the world. Surely some of the soldiers were not so perfect and that's what Joseph Heller shows us in this book. In the character of Yossarian, we have a WWII soldier who was not the epitome of courage, but a slacker and malcontent who did everything he could to get out of his duty. But Heller takes this way too far as the book becomes an extremely repetitive parade of soldiers who do nothing but try to weasel their way out of service or stab each other in the back; and officers who are inept bureaucrats who are under-qualified for their positions of authority and are focused on their own self-interest rather than winning the war. With this never-ending parade of idiots, Heller not only makes the statement that some of the fighting men in WWII were not up to the stereotypical ideal. He keeps on repeating the implication that they were ALL unworthy. He makes this point early on but fails to expand on it other than beating it to death repeatedly.

Yossarian is convinced that the military is trying to get him killed, and that those around him are insane, and he spends the book trying to get out of flying any more seemingly suicidal missions.<br />Yossarian is surrounded by a cast of bizarre characters, including Colonel Scheisskopf, obsessed with winning military parades at the expense of just about everything else, the newly promoted Major Major, who spends most of the war trying to hide from his men, and the profiteer Lieutenant Milo Minderbinder, a pure capitalist whose only ambition is to make money out of the war, and who ends up charging a commission on every military engagement.<br />Using satire, black humour and seemingly undefeatable logic, the book argues that war is insane, that the military is insane, and that, quite probably, modern life itself is insane too.<br />As Yossarian struggles against the self-serving bureaucracy at the heart of the military machine, Heller argues that the individual will always struggle against the vested interests that control the world.

Indeed, at first glance there seemes to be little reason why it should have been a success.  The plot, what little there is, orbits freely of its own accord, and the chronology is so fragmented that it takes a ridiculous effort to piece snippets of time and space together.  But it is the total absurdity and odd seriousness of Heller's bitter black humor that gave paranoid characters like Yoassarian and Major Major a cult following of average civilians and servicemen, if not the educated bigwigs.<br />To these perfunctory--and perhaps more cultured--readers, Catch-22 reads like one off-color joke after another.  Logical fallacies abound. Why the pilot Orr puts crabapples in his cheeks, the reader will never know...except that they are better than horse-chestnuts.  Why? Non sequitor. Milo buys eggs for seven cents on Malta and sells them to the mess hall...and still manages to make a profit using nothing but circular logic.  It is this type of bizarre humor that propels the entire book. Heller's over-the-top slapstick and conflicting logic will seem like a literary papercut to some readers.  Yawns, or even grimaces, may eventually paralyze most (normal) readers' hysterics about halfway through the mission to Bologna, but the pages keep turning.<br />There is a method to the rampant madness.  Beneath its warped surface, Catch-22 addresses the depressing, scary, so-serious-its-sick subject of total war.

Though it is long, it is very readable, and you'll probably go through it quickly because it's so entertaining. Aside from its sheer fun and humor however, is the true message behind the book. It is often cited as being one of the great ant-war novels - and, indeed, it is just about flawless in this respect - but it goes much deeper than that. Catch-22 is really a book about paradoxes, and the sheer (necessary) insanity of modern life. The title itself is now a common - and oft-heard - refrain in the English language, and many might be unaware of its original source. The dictionary defines &quot;Catch-22&quot; as &quot;a problematic situation for which the only solution is denied by a circumstance inherent in the problem or by a rule&quot; - and that is exactly what the novel presents: situations showing the sheer necessary insanity of modern life. (War is one such - perhaps the most obvious - instance, but there are many others. This book offers satire on other subjects as well - i.e., federal aid for farmers.) And could life as we know it exist without this inherent madness? The question might be a lot more difficult to answer than you think. The premise of this book can also be summed up in a phrase from another great author, Fyodor Dostoevsky, &quot;If everything on earth were rational, nothing would happen.&quot; That is what the book tries to say. It is not merely a simple anti-war book, despite what some shallow-headed readers and reviewers might say. I suggest that you read the book with an open mind: it's well worth it. The book is quite hilarous as well - the satire being very sharp-toothed. The book does not have a plot - indeed, it does not even attempt to tell a story, at least not in the usual sense. (Nearly) every chapter is named for a character in the book, and that chapter gradually portrays some of that particular character's crazy antics. Little bits of plot are glimpsed here and there, and then revealed gradually. The book is very non-linear and quite scattershot. It's similar to the way Kurt Vonnegut writes. I reccommend that everyone read this book.

He may be the best literary example of the tortures a sane person goes through in a world of crazy and dishonest men.  A WWII bombardier who's tired of people trying to kill him, Yossarian can't get over seeing a kid in his plane die in his arms, in fact he can't get over death at all, or the people who seem perfectly relaxed about flying into its jaws on a regular basis.  No one has the right to say he hasn't done his duty, but they say it anyway, and every time he flies the required number of missions to be sent home, Yossarian's insecure, self-aggrandizing colonel raises the number of missions.  As a result, most of Yossarian's friends end up killed in action and somehow Yossarian ends up not insane despite the best efforts of all his superior officers and doctors to convince him otherwise.<br />You almost have to take an amphetamine to SLOW the effect of Heller's rapid-fire prose.  Yossarian is the only roundly developed character in the book; everyone else is a just developed enough so as not to seem a caricature, but most are distorted extremes (e.g. Milo Minderbender who runs such a highly profitable international black market that he gets praised for bombing his own troops, or the never available \\""Major Major Major Major.\\"")  Heller uses these distortions for their humorous, satirical effect, and they work, but never do they obscure the true horror of the experience of the men fighting the war.<br />How I wish I had read CATCH-22 in high school.

Rather than attempt that, I'll offer my personal experience with this book.  I first read it as a teenager, in the mid-1970s. I'd read MASH (Hooker) before reading Catch-22 and was much more impressed with that book (and television series) than I was with Heller's work.  Catch-22, I thought, was a part of the same genre: smart-ass anti-war books.  It was funny, but bogged down in places and at times simply bored me - the whole bit with Milo Minderbinder, for example.  And Major Major was a one-note gag that I quickly dismissed.  To be honest, the part of the book that stuck with me throughout the years was Yossarian's having written, \\""I yearn for you tragically. A.T.

After completing the book, I'd discovered that Heller hadn't written an anti-war book, or an anti-Army or anti-government book -- he's written an anti-institution book!  The experiences he recorded occur daily in numerous corporations, government bureaucracies, school systems, society -- any setting in which an individual is faced with his anonymity and utter replace-ability in an institution.

One cannot picture Heller's Yossarian sporting a \\""These Colors Don't Run\\"" T-shirt and waving a flag.  Indeed, the opening chapter explicitly refutes any interpretation that suggests Yossarian's actions are rooted in a deep sense of nationalism: an uber-patriotic Texan drives almost all the men out of a hospital ward and back into combat.  Catch-22 is a book that challenges the logic of war.  It combines wry humor with startlingly affecting anecdotes to force the reader into asking questions.  It is the portrait of a man who is dangerously sane, but trapped in the insanity of war by catch-22.<BR> When I started reading Joseph Heller's Catch-22, I had no idea what to expect.  I scanned the buzzwords on the back cover...\\""apocalyptic, bitter, hilarious, monumental, original, subversive, classic.\\""  What I found was a moving satire, centered ..., an allegory who manages to retain his humanity.  The fact that Heller's Yossarian was indeed so easy to relate to contributed to the book's power.  The novel brings you deep into the world of war, as viewed by a soldier.  Yossarian's experiences are not entirely realistic, and much of what happens over the course of the novel seems to make no sense at all.  In presenting war in such a manner, Heller asks the reader whether the reality of war makes any more sense than does Yossarian's story.  Heller says that war itself is a great catch-22, a paradoxical trap that humans walk into time and time again.  He questions the logic of the illogical, and asks the reader to try and rationalize the irrational.<BR> Catch-22 is significant because it claims that not only war is a catch-22.  The metaphor extends to include life itself.  We see that the characters are not merely fighting to survive the war...they are fighting to be immortal.  Each has his own way, whether it be by enduring boredom to make time move slower, or by gaining global power through commerce and enterprise.  They are all trying to cheat death.  Heller's novel reveals many deep and often unpleasant truths, but it does it with humor and style.  For this reason, Catch-22 has reached \\""classic\\"" status and will probably remain a classic for generations to come.<BR> As a book, Catch-22 is flawless.  It is moving, witty, and ultimately one of the greatest novels I have ever read.  It deserves every one of its five stars.  However, to those who are interested in reading it, I warn you to take Heller's work with a grain of salt.  Many may find the satire offensive in light of the current global situation.  Please do not let current events get in your way.  Catch-22 is a wonderful, eye-opening novel; but as with all \\""subversive\\"" literature, it must be approached with an open mind.",2002-05-16

The absurd of democracy. The democracy of the US armed forces. Any one has rights, but each right is blocked either because someone higher has the authority to block it, or because the implementation of this right shows that the subject does not qualify for this right. In such a situation there is only one solution : escapism. The situation is dramatic since we are in Italy during the second world war. Simple pilots and bombardiers have no say whatsoever on their fate or lot. Either it goes against the authority of someone higher up who makes them do what he wants to satisfy his own ambition. Or it goes against the general trafficking by the local entrepreneur in the armed forces who aims at making money on the war situation in the name of free enterprise, asking for the war to be privitized. Or it goes against circular rules that disqualify you as a beneficiary of these rules as soon as you ask for them to apply to you. Those questions are very serious. Where is the dignity of the warriors ? Where are the noble objectives of the war ? Where is the defense of the country in such a war ? Where are courage, loyalty, heroism when everything is mercantilized and speculated upon for the profit of a few ? And what does victory mean in such a situation where some are trafficking with the enemy in order to make money, even on the military operations themselves ? The world is absurd and one can only escape from it if one wants to retain one's sanity. But, as opposed to Kafka, this author uses humor and makes us laugh at such silly situations : it is a highly funny book, but in which any laugh or smile hides the sadness of the situations or facts with great difficulty. We would really like to get angry at such mediocre middlemen who dictate hell for other people in their own interest and can do that because these other people lack the courage to rebel, are like sheep following the flock without protesting.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUhout protesting.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",2002-05-05

I didn't think that it would offer me anything new because I have seen and read several war stories.  But as I progressed further into the book, I realized that this novel is unique and is unlike anything else I have ever read.<br />The novel is based around a bomb squadron stationed on a small island near Italy.  The main focus is on one of the members of the squadron named Yossarian, who is going insane because he is caught in the middle of World War II and people that he doesn't even know are trying to kill him.  Yossarian tries desperately throughout the novel to get out of the war, and along the way he meets up with many interesting characters.  And that is what makes this novel unique: the characters.  <br />Heller does an amazing job of developing every single person in the novel, giving them all a personality type of their own.  Every personality in the novel adds a little something to the story.  From Orr's obnoxious traits to Doc Daneeka's pessimistic outlook on life, all of the characters come together to show the horrifying truth of the madness of war.  If one of the characters was missing, the novel just wouldn't have the same impact.<br />The characters also do something besides helping to develop the story; they provide insight on many aspects of life.  The discussions between characters in this book made me realize many important things.  This book shows people that they shouldn't take things for granted or take advantage of people.  Heller does this by showing the effect that it had on the characters that did those things.  This novel is a real eye-opener.<br />Heller also achieves a feat that many other authors haven't: a perfect blend of horror and humor.  Although the novel is full of disgusting depictions of war, I often found myself chuckling.  And at some points, I laughed out loud, which is something I do only if I find something truly hilarious.For example, about halfway through the novel, Yossarian has to constantly look over his shoulder because he is being stalked by a prostitute who is trying to kill him for something that he didn't even do.<br />Overall, this is an outstanding novel.  Heller's \\""Catch-22\\"" is a masterpiece that should be read by anyone and everyone.  It is a perfect blend of the horror and hilarity that is full of insight.

The characters are many and diverse, and their problems even moreso. But wow - this is quite unlike any other novel in the history of American literature.

Everyone else - all of the generals, majors, colonels, captains, pilots, privates, PFCs, etc. - they are all just a little bit off their rocker, and it can make for such an interesting reading experience. We are being shown the true madness of war - the concept of \\""patriotism\\"" and all armed conflict is challenged, because, as Yossarian says, it matters not what side they're on, because both sides want you dead. <br />Sometimes the dialogue is absolutely hilarious when two of these \\""insane\\"" characters get together for a conversation. And other times the narration makes you double over and wretch in disgust, (e.g. Yossarian tending to Snowden's wounds and that eventual outcome - if you've read you know to what I am referring). Now I wasn't alive when this was originally published, but I can only imagine the praise that it would have garnered. Nothing has ever so perfectly captured the madness and irrationality of war.

It also shows that wars aren't fought only against the enemy, but against ourselves. They are fought on the bases against clashing egos and people with no sense and those with too much sense. A person who would enjoy this book doesn't have to be just a fan of war novels. A book like this can appeal to a vast number of persons because it is so fun to read. It can also appeal to those who like the unusual and thought provoking.   <br />Yossarian is a bombardier who seems to be the wrong person in the wrong squadron. When he censors letters, he cuts about everything out and signs the aliases `Irving Washington' or `Washington Irving'. When he presented with a medal, he marches down the ramp naked. But it seems every time Yossarian is close to completing his tour of duty, the mission number is raised by five. While many crews in other squads are going home at 50 missions, Yossarian's group is at 80 and counting. So Yossarian decides enough is enough and refuse to fly more missions. This creates quite a stir between him and his superiors. This creates chaos in the squadron with the threat others will soon refuse to fly. Yossarian offered a deal: He can return back to the states and no one would have known about this or, due to insubordination, desertion, cowardice in the face of the enemy and several other charges, he will be court-martialed. We see various colorful characters throughout the book, including General Dreedle, Colonel Korn, Colonel Cathcart, Lieutenant Scheisskopf, Nately, Hungry Joe, Major ------ de Coverley, Nately's whore kid sister and Major Major, among many others. Not many of these characters have importance to the text. However, some of them make the book more fun to read and others add to the backdrop.  <br />\\""The enemy,\\"" retorted Yossarian with weighted precision, \\""is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on.\\"" <br />This quote (Which also appears in theamzon.com review above) is important in that it shows the two sides of which war is fought. For example, the number of missions is continually raised by the squadron's commanding officers, thus increasing the squadron's chances of getting killed. The quote also shows the meaningless of war. Why should you care about who wins if you are dead? Or who is really the enemy in war? <br />I wasn't sure as to what style Heller used. The book is not organized confusingly, but its tone changes throughout. We are presented with thrills, drama, horror and humor. Perhaps this is meant to show how well mixed our own lives are It can be called an anti-war novel, but unlike Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front, Catch-22 is a satire. There are some audiences that may not like Catch-22. Like I said, it has varying changes of attitude plus has somewhat explicit content concerning sex and language. Also, the novel has rather large cast of people and not all of them have importance to the story line. Nevertheless, except for romance and possibly mystery, Catch-22 has enough elements to appeal to a wide audience. <br />I have tried to review Catch-22, but I think that no one review can fully comprehend Heller's work. I'm sure that there is some more depth in the novel than I have touched on in this analysis. The novel has to be read and read again and again before it is fully understood. But this is what good novels should do. Catch-22 I liked because I like war novels and because it leaves much to think about. If there is something to dislike about it, it seems to me that the book's end leaves an open gap, possibly for a sequel that never came. Also, at over 400 pages, this is a very long read and takes some getting into. But once you do, the book doesn't stop and delivers in whole. Thus, I recommend Catch-22 (And would give it ten stars if possible) for its anti-war message, its themes about humanity and for the fact it's just so fun.",2002-02-27

I had chosen this book because I had heard the expression Catch-22 used before, and figured it must be somewhat intresting if it was a fairly common expression.<br />The first two or three chapters went slowly like most books, somewhat difficult to understand why the Yossarian character was signing documents under other people's names. As the book progressed Joesph Heller becomes, in my mind one of the greatest comic geniuses of all time. <br />Ever joke in this book is a long-running joke throughout the book. Everything that could go wrong does. The theory of Catch-22 is so realistic it is comical. The entire book shows the horror of war, but creates a laughable atmosphere about it.

It definitely has its high and low points like every novel.  This book however seemed a little more confusing than some other books that I have read in the past.  There were definitely many twists and turns throughout the story.<BR> Catch-22 is about a fighter pilot named Yossarian.  Yossarian is a man that finds himself in the middle of World War II.  He is very confused about what is going on but he is the only man that seems to know that his life is in jeopardy.  During the novel he takes you on many different adventures.  Some of them are quite funny while others are totally confusing.  He does not like the position he is in and he wants to get out of the war before he is killed.  Throughout the novel he runs into many different and interesting people.  While all of this is going on he is still trying to save his own life by trying to get out of the war.  This is where he runs into all of these different catches which forbid him from exiting duty.<BR> Overall I thought that this was a very good novel.  Throughout the book I ran into several confusing and misleading parts but it all seemed to make a connection later on in the book.  I think that the author did a very good job writing the novel.  It kept me very entertained.

Also he fakes being mentally insane. <BR>  This book is different from any other book i've read. There is a unique yet talented style of writting i've never encountered before.  In the midst of all the chaos of war the author still seems to throw in alot of humor.  It is also a different sense of humor based on simple concepts.  When I first started reading it, I was thinking too hard to understand the humor, I thought there was a deeper meaning to alot of it.  After confusing myself a bit I learend that I just have to take it for what it is and judge it at face value.  At the end the humor is more one big joke than many little ones.  My advice to the reader is to just read and accept, then later it will make sense.  An example of this humor would be on page 33, &quot;I did it to protect my good reputation in case anyone ever caught me walking around with crab apples in my cheeks.  With rubber balls in my hands I could deny there were crab apples in my cheeks.  Every time someone asked me why I was walking around with crab apples in my cheeks, I'd just open my hands and show them it was rubber balls I was walking around with, not crab apples, and that they were in my hands not my cheeks.&quot;  That is a perfect example of humor you shouldn't try to figure out.  There is nothing to figure out.  That part is just telling you about the personality of the charecter Orr.<BR>   Overall it was a very good book.

Heller adopts a completly original style for this work.  He takes scenes of outrageous comedy and mixes them together with brutal descriptions of violent conflict.  The contrast keeps the reader off balance; you never know what to expect next.  Heller's amazing talent as a writer comes through in almost every paragraph.  His dialogue is believable, sharp, and witty; his word choice is very precise; and his descriptions are incredibly powerful.  Perhaps the most amazing thing about the novel is the way that Heller juggles his gigantic cast of characters.<br />So, should you buy &quot;Catch-22&quot;?  Here are a couple sample paragraphs.

Some men are born mediocre, some men achieve mediocrity, and some men have mediocrity thrust upon them.  With Major Major it had been  all three.  Even among men lacking all distinction he inevitably stood out as one lacking more distinction than all the rest, and people who met him were all impressed by how unimpressive he was.<br />Major Major's father was a sober God-fearing man whose idea of a good joke was to lie about his age.  He was a long-limbed farmer, a God-fearing, freedom-loving, law-abiding rugged individualist who held that federal aid to anyone but farmers was creeping socialism.  He advocated thrift and hard work and disapproved of loose women who turned him down.  His specialty was alfalfa and he made a good thing out of not growing any of it.  The government paid him well for every bushel of alfalfa that he did not grow.  The more alfalfa he did not grow, the more the government gave him, and he spent every penny he didn't earn on new land to increase the amount of alfalfa he did not produce.  Major Major's father worked without rest at not growing alfalfa.  On long winter evenings he remained indoors and did not mend harness, and he sprang out of bed at the crack of noon every day just to make certain that the chores would not be done.  He invested in land wisely and soon was not growing more alfalfa than any other man in the county.  Neighbors sought him out for advice on all subjects, for he had made much money a was therefore wise.  &quot;As ye sow, so shall ye reap,&quot; he counseled one and all, and everyone said, &quot;Amen.&quot;",2001-11-25

You, as the reader get to travel with Yossarian from country to country while he makes deliveries, bombing runs, and becomes acquaintances with many people, including a hooker that he becomes quite fond of.

(25)<BR>Catch-22s antihero questions the ultimate logic of war. And what difference does that make? This is a resounding question throughout the book (and throughout the war), both in which Joseph Hellers creation, Yossarian, plays a vital role. In Catch-22, Heller creates an array of characters whose absurdity is at once satirical, silly, somber, and scathing. Particularly, the passionate, angry, strikingly sane voice of Yossarian lends a certain ironic tragedy both to the mindless pursuit we call war and to the mindless machine we call bureaucracy.<BR>It is important to read Catch-22 not only as a great piece of twentieth-century literature, but also as a primary source, written by a man whose own involvement in WWII allowed him to create this novel and this character. The characterizations that Heller creates in this novel are a clear and scathing indictment of twentieth-century isms, all of which combine to perpetuate aggression and eventually escalate into the total wars of our modern era. These -isms include patriotism, opportunism, capitalism, heroism, individualism, and sadism. In striking contrast, Yossarian seems to transcend these evil -isms and capture something missing in modern warfaresanity. Yossarians desperate desire for self-preservation is the clearest evidence of his sanity and runs counter to all of the caricatured ideals surrounding him. Certainly, like all other novels, Catch-22 has its failingsat times, it seems that the book is an emotional hodgepodge; no mood is sustained long enough to register for more than a chapter; at other times, the action andcharacters almost seem too absurd and farcical to make a valid point; at still other times, the satire seems too formulaic, unable to grasp at the ironies of life. However, for all of its failings, the mood and voice that is uniquely Yossarians allows the novel to maintain a joie de vivre and strength for all time. Yossarians logic is created against the stark backdrop of a tragic and deadly war; however, this logic lives on especially now. At the conclusion of the book, the reader is compelled to ask, of war, of bureaucracy, and of all else, And what difference does that make?<BR>This book must be read by anyone who decides to weigh in on the most recent political conversation regarding war, conflict, and terrorism.

The book follows a crazy bombardier named Yossarian who is uncanny for pointing out paradoxes and contradictions in the modern psyche. Yossarian wants to get out of the war, and he pursues several avenues, but is thwarted on one end by a neurotic, brown-nosing Colonel Cathcart, and on the other by the melancholy, and also neurotic, Doc Daneeka, who will not allow him to get of by reason of mental defect.

This book is a work of genius. I am amazed every time I read this book at how apropos the title is and how Heller manages to weave his main point, the absurdity of war, throughout every story in this book.  There is the classic scene in which the phrase Catch-22 is coined.  You can only leave the war if you are crazy, but if you have the mental capacity to want to leave the war then you must be sane.  An impossible situation for Yossarian, but what character does not live his life in accordance with absurdity? Major Major tells his secretary that no one is allowed in to his office to see him while he is in his office.  Chief White Halfcoat can not settle down anywhere because men searching for oil will uproot him to dig for crude wherever he sets down.  The man in Yossarian's tent can not be removed because he never signed in, but he can never sign in because he died before he was able to.  Milo strafes the men of his own division for money because the money he is making is for the men.  And all this time Snowden lays dying in the back.   Throughout all this absurdity this haunting little story line continues to appear about Snowden lying in the sunlight at the back of the plane shivering to death.  This is the most crucial moment in the book, for it is when Snowden spills his guts (literally) to Yossarian that the war becomes all too real.  People are dying, real people, people that Yossarian knows, and he is powerless to stop it or explain it.  It is during Snowden's death that Yossarian subscribes to this code of absurdity as all the other characters have in order to somehow cope with the concept of war.  There is a brilliant scene in which some new recruits come in to camp.  They are young and innocent.  They set up their stuff in Yossarian's tent.  They light Orr's wood, which was never to be used, and warm themselves over it.  They take the nameless man's belongings and simply chuck them outside, ignoring the logic trap which has kept this dead man alive for so long.  They are oblivious to the way things have been working in the world of this book because the war is still only a concept to them.  There is no need for them to buy into absurdity fully, for they have yet to come across something they cannot cope with.  Their Snowden is still alive, and their world still makes sense.

The distinguishing feature of this novel however is how much FUN it is to read: a pleasure from the first chapter to the last. Heller's caustic, poignant humor had me chuckling at least once per page throughout, something no other book has ever done for me. The acumen he displays in exposing our often circular reasoning was particularly memorable and is immortalized in the phrase Catch-22.<br />The book is far from a technical masterpiece - it is certainly not written in iambic pentameter - but the simple, lucid style and accessible register facilitates the progression of the story perfectly. As Albert Einstein said &quot;Things should be as simple as possible - but not any simpler&quot; and Heller honours this axiom very well. The only &quot;difficult&quot; element of style is the non-chronological plot structure, which can be confusing at times. Yet, even this serves a purpose, that is, to create an atmosphere of confusion that adds to the overall effect the novel has on the reader.<br />The delightful entertainment value of Catch-22 is an essential element of, and adds greatly to, its central virtue: the satiric exposure of human inadequacies. However much fun the novel is to read it remains a social commentary that - below the surface - is as frightening as any Stephen King novel. Heller strips reality bare, eliminating the hue of our opinions, the bells-and-whistles and comforting rationalizations; forcing the reader to look at the world - and himself - impartially.

Heller's text of Catch-22 is a recipe for delicious humor and refreshing insight that make the bitter pills he's pushing down your throat slide down so much more smoothly, almost too easily. As an author, Heller will not rest until you, as the reader, are his equal as a cynic. He pulls it off masterfully, too, his persuasion of patriots into perversion of their most beloved creeds, his destruction of the reader's regard for respected traditions and accepted notions about America.   Through the words of the brash, self-centered Captain Yossarian as well as the from the perch of omniscient narrator, Heller tells it like it is (says he). The world is a petty place, and survival is job one. That Yossarian, as the antihero, would shamelessly sabotage the arrangement of a dangerous support mission rather than risk his neck to help out others reflects a Darwinian influence that resounds without compassion. &quot;The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on,&quot; rants Yossarian as he argues with the overly intellectual Clevinger. Yossarian displays no qualms as he announces, with conviction, &quot;It doesn't make a damned bit of difference who wins the war to someone who's dead.&quot;   What makes Heller's work in this novel so excellent is the fact although his ideas are morally bankrupt and bleak, he masks their horrid faces masterfully with his ingenious strokes of hilarity.

Heller structures Catch-22 in a jumble of flashbacks of events and repetitions. Heller may first mention something very random at the beginning of the book, and make it seem like it's some joke.  However, then later on in the novel he'll actually tell the situation behind the first mention of it, and it sickens the reader to learn what truly happened.  For example, Yossarian, the main character in the book, has a \\""dead man\\"" in his tent.  At first this just seems to strengthen the opinion that Yossarian is insane.  Heller repeats this use of the \\""dead man\\"" all throughout the book until finally he tells the reader who the \\""dead man\\"" really is.  The \\""dead man\\"" is a man named Mudd.  Mudd transferred into the same squadron that Yossarian was in, but immediately went on a mission after he put his stuff in Yossarian's tent.  He was killed on that mission, but his paperwork hadn't actually transferred him into the squadron.  Therefore he was never actually in the squadron.  That means his stuff still lies on one of the beds in Yossarian's tent, and no one can take it out because it's really not there.  At first the reader may find the mention of the dead man to be humorous, but when the reader finds out the truth they feel disgusted with what they were laughing at.  Another structural episode that is repeated numerous times throughout the book, deals with a man named Snowden.  At first he is just mentioned, and once again this adds to the thought that Yossarian is insane.  Then near the end of the book Heller tells the reader what really happened with Snowden.  This graphic description of Snowden's death sickens the reader and once again enforces the purpose of the author to show how horrible war is.  Irony also is very prevalent and purposeful in conveying Heller's message from the book.  One instance shows how corrupt the management has become.  The leaders of the squadron want them to go bomb a bridge to form a roadblock, or that is at least what they tell the men.  The truth is they just want to get a nice picture of a \\""bomb pattern\\"".  They don't care that this will kill innocent civilians, all they want is their stupid \\""bomb pattern\\"".  It is ironic that the commanders don't uphold that decency of not killing people just for the fun of it when they should.  They really don't care even if their own men die, just as long as they get some recognition.  Another irony demonstrating how war twists things, happens through the chaplain.  It says \\""the chaplain had sinned, and it was good\\"".  This is ironic because the chaplain is supposed to uphold some sort of righteousness even in trial, and now when he sins it is good.  A paradox that also portrays how war really messes people up is the fact that Yossarian thinks that everyone is \\""trying to kill him\\"".  At first this statement seems ironic, but the more the reader gets into the book the more truth it has. Not only does the enemy try to shoot Yossarian down, but his own commanders are trying to kill him by making him fly more missions.  Colonel Cathcart, the leading colonel of the squadron, keeps raising the number of missions therefore giving more chances to everyone else to kill him.  In an indirect way the colonel tries to kill him, and according to Yossarian so is everyone else.  War has made him paranoid, and it destroys any sort of faith in goodness or even any kind of truth.  War has completely warped everything that he is.  Heller's purpose is to show how terrible and twisted war can make a person.",2001-05-07

Most of the chapters in this book are very funny.  They centre on things that are ludicrous and silly.  A great number of things happen in this book that could not and would not ever happen in real life.  The characters in Catch-22 though, never notice the absurdities around them, and this contributes to the humor of the book.  Heller shows the characters behaving as if everything is fine to show how soldiers in the war are made to do whatever their superiors want them to.  Indeed, a major theme of the book is that the individual is powerless to stand against large institutions such as the military or big business.  Different characters in the book symbolize the larger forces against Yossarian, the protagonist.  Yossarian is constantly being \\""defeated\\"" by these institutions, despite his brave efforts to oppose them.  Heller also achieves his purpose though the juxtaposition of humor and horror.  He will present a ridiculous situation and invite us to laugh at it, and then immediately present a feeling of horror, such as showing us that we are no different than the characters that are behaving so oddly.  This juxtaposition is consistent throughout the novel.  One of Heller's chief methods of conveying his hilarity and dismay is irony.  His dry, cynical, irony fills the book with funny situations and afterwards makes one think more deeply about them.  Heller amplifies the absurdities of war to make them impossible to miss.

Portrayed through confusion and satire, Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is simultaneously humourous and cutting.  Given to similarly amusing and sickening, Heller says all there is to say about the insanity and inhumanity of war.<br />Catch-22 opens during World War II with John Yossarian, a bomber in the Air Force, most fixedly in the hospital with liver problems.  However, Yossarian is not actually sick, but is feinting disease to isolate himself from the death of war.  A naturally high temperature leads doctors to believe Yossarian is sick when he is not.  When Yossarian finally leaves the hospital and goes back to his unit, he finds himself stationed on the island of Pianosa, near the Italian coast and the Mediterranean Sea.  It is not clear whether the hospital scene comes before after the next part Yossarian narrates, because his narrative jumps back and forth through time.  It is part of the confusion which controls the reader's perception of the nonsensicality of war.  Out of the hospital, it seems like nobody seems to truly understand that there is a war going on except for Yossarian.  In fact, Yossarian is so set on the death involved with war that he believes that everyone is trying to kill him specifically.  He finds it infuriating that &quot;millions of people&quot; are trying to kill for no fault of his own.  As he says in an argument with Clevinger about the pointlessness and misdirection of war, &quot;The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on.&quot;  In this perception, Yossarian is unique and practical, decisively demanding that his life is more important than national ideals or abstract principles.  He is completely determined to gain immortality or die trying.  The largest perceived threat on Yossarian's life at the moment is his air missions, and so attempts to find a way to be grounded.Yossarian asks Doc Daneeka if he would be grounded if he were found to be crazy.  Daneeka tells him yes, but there's a catch: Catch-22 says that there's a rule that says for any pilot to be grounded for reasons of insanity must first ask to be grounded.  However, anyone who asks to be grounded must obviously be sane. This is Yossarian's first encounter with Catch-22, but it comes back to meet him and others again and again.  The most poignant description of Catch-22 is given near the end of the book by an old woman mourning in the ruins of what was once a city.  She sums it up by saying that &quot;[The soldiers] have the right to do anything we can't stop them from doing.&quot;  This is portrayed through every bureaucratic move throughout the entire novel.  Higher ranking officers do things to their subordinates simply because they can, or because they believe it will give them a good reputation or promotion.  Yossarian and his companions are simply inhuman resources for their blindly ambitious superior officers to take advantage of.  Their officers would rather their men took pictures of their bombing runs that looked impressive rather than actually accomplish anything.  On top of this, the men can never leave, because higher ranking officials simply raise the number of missions they are required to run before leaving.  In this way, all the men are retained within the authorities control.  All this is done simply because they can.  Because &quot;they have the right to do anything we can't stop them from doing.&quot;  Catch-22 is, in essence, the law that makes war and murder &quot;legal,&quot; the mind-set that moralizes any immoral act, the entire mechanism under which the army can feasiblely run.  Without Catch-22, war could not exist, because of morals, values, ethics, individualism, and anything else that governs rational human thought.<br />A perfect example of the completely nonsensical nature of the surroundings is the power positions.  In this story, the mess officer Milo Minderbinder is the one of the most powerful people in the world.  He has such a hold on economics that he practically control the entire world.  He bombs his own camp as a result of a deal with Germany, he employs the use of every air force in the world for his monetary benefit.  Because he controls so much of the market, he manages to buy a shipment of eggs at 7 cents an egg and sell them at 5 cents an egg and still make a profit.  He manages this because he is in control of both the company which buys the eggs and the company which sells them.  Through subtle and ridiculous manipulation of the market, he probably has more control than any other person in the world.<br />In sharp contrast to this whimsical, comic nature of Milo is the gory, reoccurring scene of Snowden.  Yossarian began his downward spiral into cynicism with the death of his copilot Snowden.  Throughout the novel, the story slow unwinds of the traumatic experience of Snowden being shot while with Yossarian, and Snowden dying slowly in Yossarian's arms with his entrails splattered all over Yossarian's uniform.  Snowden's final words were simply &quot;I'm cold.&quot;<br />Catch-22 is, in my opinion, one of the greatest books written on the insanity of war.  The mechanisms Heller uses in his novel to portray confusion which may be hindrances only enhance the entire read of the novel.  While many war stories manage to encompass the horror and meaninglessness of war, few if any other manage to do so with so much wit and humour.  Nothing is more sickening then to find yourself emotionally connecting the horrible death of a human being with the abstract orders of an ambitious power seeker.  Heller's story of the pursuit of life and the  tragedy of death finds both the core values and issues at and, as well as the humour and insanity forever present in that never-ending reality: war.",2001-02-12

And Yossarian lives on...","This dark comedy of World War Two takes place on the small island of Pianosa, off the coast of Italy.  The main character, Yossarian, is an American bombardier, and like his squadron, spends much of his time either flying dangerous bombing runs over northern Italy, sleeping off his exuberances in Rome, or going on some hilarious comical escapade through which Heller is able to satirize the American military bureaucracy.<br />At first glance (or the first reading), this novel appears to be a random collection of character sketches, loosely arranged around Yossarian and containing only confusingly humorous conversational drivel.  But on the second reading, everything makes sense and it is possible to see how the comic absurdity changes from light and fun at the beginning into a dark and melancholy satire by the end of the novel.<br />Joseph Heller first published this novel in 1961, and since then the phrase &quot;Catch-22&quot; has entered into the English language as a &quot;paradoxical problem or situation.&quot;  In this book, Catch-22 is an obscure military regulation that allows for an illogical and absurd system to exist.<br />Completely illogical logic and embarrassingly simple complexity await the individual who undertakes the reading of this excellent novel, which has become both an amusing comedy and a pensive tragedy at the same time.<br />Bottom line?

The book pokes fun at the paradoxes of everyday life in the military as it follows the tour of a young pilot, John Yossarian.  Yossarian spends his tour of duty going from his station in Pianosa and the city of Rome, where the men meet with Italian prostitutes.  While stationed Yossarian has to deal with the loss of many friends and the paradox of the mysterious catch-22, until he finally decides to leave using any means necessary.<br />Review: The satire that Heller uses in Catch-22 is enough by itself to satisfy the reader.  However, he also includes an interesting and action-packed storyline that is enough to make any reader enjoy the book.  Heller's outlook on life, as expressed by the protagonist, offers a unique perspective on its irony.  The use of a mysterious military directive, catch-22, is how Heller describes the irony best.  For instance, Yossarian cannot be grounded from flight unless he asks to be due to insanity.  However, according to catch-22, asking to be grounded demonstrates an appreciation for life, which constitutes sanity.<br />The only downfall to Catch-22 is Heller's extreme use of stream-of-consciousness, the use of jumping through time as the protagonist remembers events.  It is very confusing in the beginning of the book and makes the book difficult to start.  However, as the book continues and more events are included, it becomes easier to establish a true timeline, and the book can fully be appreciated for the marvelous literary work that it is.",2001-01-25

Yossarian was a pilot and was the main character in the book.  Catch-22 tells the story of World War II through Yossarian's point of view, from hospital visits to bombing missions to showing up to his medal ceremony naked.  <br />The book also ranges in topic from a Major who everyone was too afraid of to ask his first name to a mess officer who runs a bogus company.  Many topics are amusing, but the majority is not.  They are very human.<br />Review: Catch-22 is the most honest book I have ever read.  It feels like I am sitting on Yossarian's shoulder for the whole book.  I feel all his emotions and thoughts, and they seem so realistic.  The characters are completely believable and I can imagine a real person behaving as they do. I feel like a part of the scenes in the book.<br />The writing style is very good, too. Heller doesn't use flowery language or over describe situations.  His language choice is absolutely perfect for the situations he is describing.<br />Many novels from World War II seem unbelievable and overly heroic, but Catch-22 is not either of the two.

This is a re-write of that disappointing effort.<br /><br />I just finished the superb [[ASIN:0312596855 Tracy Daugherty biography]] of Joseph Heller, which led me to my annual re-read of this book.  I was introduced to this book in October 1980 in high school Honors English, and I have read it at least every year since.  I never get tired of reading it, and every time I do I find something new.  I adore this book.  It is my #1 favorite of all time, and likely always will be.<br /><br />Synopsis: Twenty-eight-year-old World War II B-25 bombardier Yossarian is faced with the prospect of death at every turn, and no one notices or cares.  Eventually he finds a way to do something about it.<br /><br />The book is wild, sprawling, seemingly out of control.  The non-linear format can be a turnoff to many, but if you stick with it, and just let the story unfold, it all makes sense.  The story comes together, page by page.  The payoff comes only in the final pages, but it all comes together.  Really.  It's also deeply, deeply funny, with an enduring humor that operates on a number of levels.  Although written more than fifty years ago, the language and dialog remain colloquial.<br /><br />One thing I wrote eleven years ago I still stand by: the book is about a man and men, set in a purely masculine environment.  The point of view is overwhelmingly male, and sexist, with every single woman in the book described in primarily sexual terms.  Yossarian admits to it on page 291, \\""...Everything reminds me of sex.\\""  Women exist in the story as foils for male action and as bases for Heller's editorializing. This being said, I would hope women reading the book gain some insight on general male approaches to and perceptions of women.<br /><br />So what is the book about?  There's a lot going on here.  Heller took more than ten years to craft it, its 443 pages edited down from the original manuscript's 1,000+.  It's about the nature and burden of conformity in the most conformist institution (the military) during the most conformist of times (war), and how that conformity--and unquestioning obedience--will kill you.  It's about the cruelty and inherent dishonesty in bureaucratic and hierarchical institutions, the inevitable corruption within capitalism, abuse of power, greed, deception, justice and injustice, heroism and cowardice, God and religion, and the manipulation of logic and language to legitimize a wrong, pronounce sentence or make a sale.  The book is about the loss of innocence and the concomitant loss of youth to age, awareness, and ultimately to mortality. It is about the value and vitality of individuality, about friendship, humor and sex, and how essential these are to sense of self, well-being, and how we relate to others.<br /><br />While the story and themes are powerful enough, Heller's writing itself is a pure joy, with such gems as:<br /><br />-- Yossarian under physical exam, his body \\""...drugged and derogated, dusted and dredged, fingered and photographed...\\""<br />-- \\""Hungry Joe was a throbbing, ragged mass of motile irritability.\\""<br />-- \\""...he was dead, a bleeding cinder on the barbarous pile whom nobody had heard in those last precious moments...\\""<br />-- \\""The clinging, overpowering conviction of death spread steadily with the continuing rainfall, soaking mordantly into each man's ailing countenance like the corrosive blot of some crawling disease.\\""<br />-- General Peckem's \\""martyred smile of sweet reasonableness...\\""<br />-- \\""...her hands lying in her lap like fallen moths.\\""<br />-- \\""...the crazy, craggy, patchwork canyon of crashing antiaircraft fire...\\""<br />-- \\""...the open-air theater, where the milky, dust-filled beam bursting horizontally from the projector slashed a conelike swath in the blackness and draped in a fluorescent membrane of light the audience tilted on the seats there in hypnotic sags...\\""<br />-- Major Aarfy's \\""...fustian, moon-faced ineptitude...\\""<br />-- \\""..the primal, powerful, rhapsodic instinctual rhythm of erotic ardor and abandonment...\\""<br />-- \\""...a howling, strident, onrushing cacophony of overwhelming sound...\\""<br /><br />And there's Chapter 39, \\""The Eternal City,\\"" one of my favorite passages in the world.  It is a stark, shattering 14 pages in heavy, dense paragraphs offering grisly detail in which Yossarian treads the inferno, descending into and through man's unending inhumanity to man, realizing it has existed and always will exist, only that up until now he had been unable to see it.  The violence, cruelty and injustice cascade through the narrative.  Heller's pacing, structure and word choice in this chapter are the high point of this book.<br /><br />As heavy as this book gets as the story unfolds, there is a great deal of humor, and this books still makes me laugh out loud.  Its humor comes in all forms, clever puns, plays on words, turns of phrase, illogical actions, and at times the darkest and cruelest black comedy I have ever encountered.  It is a deep, thought-provoking book which still makes me laugh out loud after more than 35 readings in the past 31 years.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a brilliant work of fiction, an absolute treasure, and I recommend it with all of my heart.tinctual rhythm of erotic ardor and abandonment...\\""  -- \\""...a howling, strident, onrushing cacophony of overwhelming sound...\\""  And there's Chapter 39, \\""The Eternal City,\\"" one of my favorite passages in the world.

I  was not sure what to expect when I selected this book but I was thouroughly impressed.  I am not a big fan of war books but this novel is much more than that.  Heller's attention to detail and great dialogue made this book exciting to read.  The conversations held by the characters not only make you laugh but also make you think about the points that they are discussing.  Heller's use of vocabulary also inhances the quality of the book.  He uses words that are specific to the war and time period.  Although sometimes I was confused by the large vocabulary I kept reading because I knew that I would still understand what was going on. Heller describes the scene of war as a place that at some times people would hate to live while at other times a place of paradise.  I think that his description of the characters is unlike any i have ever read.  Heller describes the characters by writing about their actions and past expierneces.  He uses their actions to write about the way they treated others and they way they thought about things.  This method was very usefull because it didn't cause the book to stop and explain the character it just told the story and described the character at the same time.      Many times in society we take for granted our views on others and ourselves.  This book realates the tragedies and triumphs of war to the problems of human society.  It opens the minds of those who cannot see the wrongs in society.  I think the term &quot;catch 22&quot; which is used throughout the book in many different instances refers to life.  In the book no matter what the pilots do they cannot get out of flying the missions, while in life no matter what a person does during there life all people will endure the same tragedy of death.

Catch-22 according to the dictionary is \\""a situation in which a desired outcome or solution is impossible to attain because of a set of inherently illogical rules or conditions.\\""  Joseph Heller created the idiom and I believe its widespread use in the English-speaking world is proof that this book is genius.  The books protagonist is named Yossarian and he is a bombardier during World War II.  What is most baffling for Yossarian is that everyone is trying to kill him, people he knows and does not know personally - the Germans, the pilots that fly the planes, the Colonels that force him to be there.<br />What's most baffling is that Yossarian cannot find a logical way to remove himself from the situation.  The Doctors tell him that he may be grounded if he's crazy.  If he continues to fly the missions he would be crazy, but if he asks the doctors to ground him for being crazy they could automatically deduct that he is quite sane and trying to preserve his life.  That's the catch.  Catch-22 - there is no possible situation that could work - a Lose vs. Lose circumstances.<br />Lets just say that Heller thinks little of the situations that men and women must endure during their military careers during a time of war.  The book is poignant, funny, and very readable. It's a long book, but I was sorry to see it end.  For me - Yossarian will still live on and continue to persevere and fight against these Catch-22s!  On a macro scale, we must ask ourselves why we glorify the victories (or losses) that our country undergoes during a time of war - have we won or have we lost the battle - or does it matter?  Did we both lose?  In other words, war is a Catch-22 - nobody wins.  Read this book!",2000-09-20

It's an allegorical critique of Capitalism and the whole Western  system.  In the twilight of socialism that has descended since the fall of  Communism, the book's critique seems unduly harsh, but the warning message  is worth remembering.<br />What is &quot;Catch-22?&quot;  There are at least a  dozen examples in the book, and seem very difffernt.  What they have in  common is that each one is really saying &quot;the rules of the system  prevent reform of the system.&quot;  Examples include &quot;you can only  enter the Major's office when he isn't in it,&quot; and &quot;you can get  out of the war if you're crazy, but if you ASK, it proves you're not  crazy.&quot;<br />Milo, the arch Capitalist, is in many ways the worst  villain in the book.

The  corruption of Milo's money reaches far up the chain of command, and many of  the worst absurdities are tracable to Milo's schemes.<br />The only way around  the system is to break the rules -- to overthrow it.  The new recruits who  throw out the personal effects of the dead man in Yossarian's tent show how  in a small way; Orr demonstrates it in a large way, and the fact that Orr  ends up in Sweden points to socialism as a solution to the problems of the  capitalist world.<br />Obviously, in today's world, the example of Sweden  doesn't look so appealing, and the Capitalist West has shown substantial  ability to reform itself inside its own rules.

I write this however because all that can be said about this book deserves to  be said and is worth saying again and again and again. &quot;Catch-22&quot;  is a monumental creation, the product of a brilliant inspiration that does  not recognize itself and such and thus plays things out on its own terms,  without pandering or pretention. I believe that this book came about simply  because Joseph Heller had a unique vision and chose to record it. It just  so happens that what was unique about Heller's vision was his ability to  view the true madness of the world and then distill that madness into  images and words, recording his viewpoint with shocking clarity.<br />I will  not deny that the presentation is ludicrously over the top. What I will  argue is that this book could have been written in no other way. Heller saw  the world in general, and war in particular, as irredeemably absurd. To be  honest then Heller had to paint an absurd picture, and make sure that it  could not be mistaken for anything but absurdity. It follows that the  presentation should be equally absurd. This is only one way in which which  Heller give the finger to conventional literary wisdom.  &quot;Catch-22&quot; was written to defy socio-political conventions and it  would be hypocritical to adhere with any closeness to conventions of the  arena in which he chose to make his stand.<br />Two common criticisms of  &quot;Catch-22&quot; are that it lacks a strong plotline and that it is too  long. The first criticism is perfectly legitimate. &quot;Catch-22&quot; not  only lacks a &quot;strong&quot; plotline, it comes very close to lacking  anything that could be considered a plot line at all. Why, I ask, should  Heller have sacrificed his ideas and vision for the luxury of a fabricated  plotline? One of the major themes of &quot;Catch-22&quot; is the  pointlessness and circularity of war, indeed, of life in general. It is  only one more example of the integrity with which &quot;Catch-22&quot; was  written that Heller chose to structure the novel in a way that would  reinforce the that theme. Who needs a plot, anyway, when the theme is so  strongly evident and so soundly delivered. As for the length, I don't think  heller could have encapsulated the enormous scope of this book in any  smaller framework. Once one gets into &quot;Catch-22&quot; it becomes an  intoxicating, encompassing, and overwhelmingly enjoyable reading  experience. Dealing with the length of the book is not a problem when it is  enjoyed as thoroughly as I enjoyed it. It also allows for repeated  readings, as one can crack it open at almost any point and read on  indefinately, find fresh enjoyment and enlightenment in each page.  &quot;Catch-22&quot; was brilliantly concieved and delivered and will be  just as convincing hundreds of years from now as it is now.",2000-06-11

So I do.   Every time life gets to be too much, I follow Heller's advice and run  straight for the solacing lunacy of Yossarian &amp; Co.

They are all crazy in their only special little ways, each fighting their own battle for freedom.  Yossarian knows their all  crazy; he knows he must get out, not for a loved one or for just the hatred  of war itself. Yossarian fears for his life, he fears it every time he  climbs aboard his bomber.  Some man fly for patriotism and others fly  because it needs to be done; the younger men believe war is a great and fun  thing.  When they do fly many do not come back, as Yossarian can testify.  Before his eyes he has seen many of his comrades die, which only depletes  what is left of his sanity. The squadron's lack of sanity is at most times  the source of great humorous occasions. From Milo's crazy antics of buying  and selling of merchandise to Major Major's rules, the laughs far outnumber  the moments of tears. Heller uses such great detail to bring the reader to  the limits of sadness, and the characters means to dealing with it are the  craziest of all.

Catch-22 is brought to life by a remarkably diverse cast  of characters, all of them interwoven into a plot that unfolds and comes  together with relentless perfection. Heller lets us see not only through  the eyes of his main character, the paranoid bombardier Yossarian, but  gives us a glimpse inside dozens of other vivid personalities, plunging us  into their thoughts and dreams and hopes and fears and desires. Their  stories, told with such a sarcastic and surreal edge, go far beyond the  bounds of outrageousness, yet the unarguable truth they represent holds the  potency of a maxim.

It has become my favorite book since, and my &quot;guide&quot; and companion. I have read critical essays on this book, and have had time to  contemplate it. Yes, I agree that the book is &quot;anti-war&quot; and at  times, &quot;incoherent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; <br /> However, it wasn't so much  &quot;anti-war&quot; as it was anti-establishment.(Many of the readers will  recall the unforgettable villains such as--many of them, caricatures  representing the inherent flaws of the war establishment-- Milo  Minderbinder, Generals Peckem and Scheisskopf, Lt. Col Korn, Col. Cathcart,  Capt. Black , ex-PFC Wintergreen, Cpl Whitcomb.) And if it had been  &quot;incoherent&quot; and &quot;disorganized,&quot; it was because the  author had deliberately planned the story to capture the absurdity and  irrational logic of the establishment. In the midst of the corrupt and at  times, inept corporate/military machine is our hero, Yossarian, and his  squadronmates who are pitted in a struggle against the horror of war, and  their own self-serving superiors and bureaucrats and an entrepreneur whose  only collective interest is to enlarge their fold at the expense of human  lives.&lt;/p&gt; <br /> Unlike many other books that have clumsily tried to  emulate its inimitable style since its publication,--Winston Groom's  FORREST GUMP comes to my mind--CATCH-22 balances exceptional hillarity   with a biting warning against the absurd totalian logic of the system we  often take for granted.&lt;/p&gt; <br />Moreover, it gives us hope through  Yossarian's--and perhaps, Orr's--final triumph against the  Milo-Cathcart-Korn-Wintergreen Axis when they tried to subvert him in his  weakest moment. Where George Orwell depressed his readers with the  capitulation of Winston Smith to Big Brother/O'Brien in his 1984, Heller's  main message in the book --that one can triumph against the establishment  if he has the courage--offered me hopes.&lt;/p&gt; <br />That is why it will  always remain my favorite book.

Boy will we miss him.<br />There are only two ways to look at &quot;Catch-22.&quot;  One side believes that it is a demoralizing work that compromises the integrity and honor of the  United States military.  The other side argues that this is a classic work  of fiction to be enjoyed by generations to come.  Who is right?<br />Both  sides are.  I can honestly say that Heller's hilarious, upsetting,  poignant, and disquieting work is one that I am proud to have in my  library, even going so far as to say that it is truly one of my favorite  works.  Seeing as I serve in the US Air Force, one would ask, &quot;How can  you so thoroughly enjoy a book which so blatantly criticizes the military  and all that it stands for?&quot;  To this I reply, &quot;That's the  point.&quot;<br />Stationed on an imaginary island off the coast of Italy  called Pianosa, a disgruntled World War II bombardier is desparate to get  out of the Air Force because he believes that everyone is trying to kill  him.  For most people, this plot wouldn't hold up in a 463-page novel, much  less a short story!  However, Heller's superior characterization (the  squadron commanding officer's name was Major Major Major Major) and ability  to make the most basic situation ironic (an aircrew member who is diagnosed  insane is unfit for flying per Air Force regulations must actively request  to be taken off of the flight roster, but if he is sane enough to make such  a request, then he is deemed fit for flying) leads me to wonder why the  book isn't even longer.<br />The characters will tear at your emotions like a  Cuisinart.  You will both love and hate them at the same time, especially  the conniving Milo Minderbinder, who had his own squadron bombed to further  the causes of his international black-market goods cartel, a cartel which  he runs with the use of the squadron's planes.<br />Joseph Heller is now gone,  but his legacy lives on.

More than just an antiwar screed, this sprawling novel with its intricate plots and huge cast  of characters is a complex story of survival in an absurdly tragi/comic  war. It manages to be both hysterically funny and saddly moving while  forcing the reader to look differently at such concepts as 'honor',  'heroism', 'patriotism' and 'cowardice'.<br />As several reveiwers have  pointed out, the book is slow to start. Part of that has to do with the  author's need to seduce the reader to his peculiar veiwpoint, to introduce  the numerous characters and to set the stage that will make the absurd seem  normal and the normal seem absurd. Once perceived, the structure of the  book is a joy to experience. The recurring interrupted flashbacks, the  seemingly unrelated subplots and digressions, the cast of characters, each  stranger than the one before, all reveal more and more as the book  progresses so that by the end one feels enmeshed in a real story of real  people - though it is totally crazy. As if Lewis Carroll had written The  Inferno instead of Dante.<br />Some of the scenes and characters are as  inventive as anything ever writtn and remain vivid in the mind long after  the book is finished. Yossarian is a complete person, but much that he  experiences is fragmented and bizarre. The 'soldier in white' (all readers  will remember this one) is a perfect example of Heller's genius. This scene  is both horrifying and hysterically funny, and goes to the heart of the  book's message.<br />Joesph Heller died yesterday. I will miss him because  there will be no more Heller books.

Moreover, it did exactly what a classic should do: it makes you think.  Why do we go to war?  Why do we kill?  Why did we follow the insanity of war that pervaded the  twentieth century? I admire Mr. Heller for this. However, what if Hitler  and the Nazi's overran the world because the allies did not find the  rational to destroy or stop them.  It is doubtful that any such book would  have ever been written, let alone even discussed.  There would be no free  speech, no freedom of assembly or of religion - among other liberties.   Yossarian would not be able to enjoy sleeping with Sheisskopf's wife  because he would most likely be sent to a prison camp to die. And because  the world still has a Saddam in control, killing will remain.  I enjoyed  the book because I am thinking about enlisting, and the book challenges me  to consider that which is usually ignored.  The author's reasoning forces  me to deal with the issue of killing another human and why I would follow  orders to do so.  In the US and other countries soldiers willingly vow to  defend their constitution to death.  Can anyone say that all those who had  ever enlisted were insane?  Thomas Aquinas grappled with the hypocrisies of  war, and derived reasoning on Just War in his treatise.  Yossarian reflects  what is very much prevalent in the twentieth century: the  'let-me-get-mine,' self-preserving disposition.  Heller underestimates  human character - intentionally or not.  His crack on leadership is  humorous, but not convincing. In reality, leaders  - whether in the  military of democracies or in democratic governments - for the most part  are sane and intelligent enough to make wise and justifiable decisions.   The book is excellent for its provocation.  However, one should also take  the other extreme.  James Webb's Fields of Fire is an excellent novel  depicting an USNA graduate as a Marine in Vietnam.  The character in the  end rebukes all the draftdodgers and protesters at an Ivy League school,  calling them cowards and hypocrites for not protecting the same freedoms  they were exercising and that other people were willing to die for.  In  all, Catch-22 either provokes praise or rebuke.  The style is its own, as  is the content. Whatever the opinion, enjoy the book for where it can take  you.

Singularly the best book I have ever read, I might even go so far as to say that it changed my life. It has always seemed a somewhat ambivalent book to me however. It never entirely takes one side of a subject over another, which accents the absurdity of the war and of the little island of Pianosa. <BR><BR> The story itself is mainly about Yossarian, although he isn't completely the main character. He is not a coward, but he is not willing to let himself die (one of the more sensible things I've ever heard in my life!) He is a man of conviction, even if they are the &quot;wrong&quot; ones. <BR><BR> Almost everyone around him is crazy, or seems crazy to him. Everyone around him thinks HE is crazy. Yossarian must suffer through one of the worst wars this century has ever seen. He wants to find his way out, but the absurdity of catch-22 won't let him. <BR><BR> Catch-22 means that you can never win. A good example of catch-22 (which has now officially entered the English language to mean essentially the same thing) is when Yossarian says he should be grounded because he's crazy. If Yossarian wants to fly, he HAS to be crazy. However, if he wants to be grounded, he has to ask. As soon as he asks, he isn't crazy anymore, because he doesn't want to fly anymore. That sentence I just wrote might be a little hard to swallow and I recommend you read it again. <BR><BR> Anyway, catch-22 is always showing up and Yossarian doesn't mind until it wreaks havoc on a little whore-house in Rome. <BR><BR> Meanwhile the shocking surprise ending comes around with Yossarians idiot friend, Orr.

I am now feeling scared and unsure about the success of my attempt to read this classic. Most of the reviews talk about writing styles I have either avoided or attempted and failed, like stream of consciousness and disjointed timelines (I absolutely COULD NOT finish The Sound and the Fury by William Faulkner, I had no idea what was going on or who anyone was). So now I'm scared this is going to be another of those 'classics' that everyone's read, and understood, but me. I just finished The Lord of the Flies and while I obviously read it, I'm not sure I understood it. Oh well. Isn't there a song along the lines of 1 out of 2 ain't bad? I don't imagine they were singing about the reading and comprehension of books but I guess it still works. To be continued...<br /><br />8/4 - Heller writes a sentence like I did when I was 10 - rambling and never-ending. Fortunately his exceedingly long sentences make more sense and are more interesting than my 10-year-old attempts. Love Dr. Daneek who does nothing but complain about his bad luck in being dragged into the war and visit his own medical staff everyday to find out what's wrong with his health, only to find that there's nothing wrong and complain about that too. That's my attempt at a Hellerish sentence (I never liked punctuation anyway, sometimes it's just too hard to know where and when to use it). To be continued...<br /><br />11/4 - There are some books that are funny and hilarious and even LOL. These are the ones that make you snigger or laugh out loud while you're reading it on a train full of silent passengers. You know, the morning commuters who quietly type away at their laptops or catch a few extra minutes of sleep before work), who all turn to look (and grimace) at you at the same time (kind of pod-people-like). Then there are the kinds of books that are amusing and humourous. These are the kind of books that might make you smile and go \\""Hah\\"" under your breath without opening your mouth. It's the quieter more polite version of funny and hilarious. The more sophisticated and publicly acceptable way to demonstrate humour. For me, Catch-22 is definitely the latter (although I'm not all that worried about publicly acceptable ways to demonstrate humour, if it's funny I'm gonna laugh). There are many instances of, I think the right term is, irony, which for me are enough to put a smile on my face, but not enough to actually create a laugh. I don't know if that's my sometimes simple and sometimes immature sense of humour or if it's just not a LOL kind of book. To be continued...<br /><br />10/6 - This is such a complicated book to read and an even more complicated book to review. There are so many plot threads running through the book that it's hard to keep track of everything that's happening and who's involved in each thread. I'm nearly finished and I'm having trouble remembering not only the nuances of the 400 pages I've read but some of the main details of the plot. I'm going to have to re-read this a number of times before I can honestly say that I fully understood it - I think I might buy myself a copy as the one I'm reading at the moment is currently a week overdue at the library and I figure it might take me about the same length of time to read it next time around as it has this time. To be continued...<br /><br />13/06 - I found the conlcusion of the book to be possibly more confusing than any previous part I had read. Everything seemed to be happening very quickly, too quickly. Then suddenly the final chapter arrived, it was like a whirlwind that swept all the characters' plot lines along and in the confusion everything was suddenly, a bit magically, tied into a neat bow, when 20 pages back you couldn't imagine how the book could ever finish with any kind of proper ending. After I finished I was looking at some of the other books Heller wrote and was very surprised to see that he had written a sequel. Despite the open ending (Yossarian maybe/maybe not escaping the military hospital and getting to Sweden) Heller wrote for Catch-22 I would never have guessed that there was a sequel to it, it just doesn't seem like the kind of book (or Heller the kind of author) to have a sequel (or at least not a successful one. I mean how can you write a sequel to a book like Catch-22? I'm a bit scared to read it. What if it's not as good? I'm sure it won't be dreadful, but it might not be great and that would be a real disappointment after the greatness of Catch-22.k could ever finish with any kind of proper ending.
