Never read it as a young man, but here, as a Senior citizen  thought it might be an about-time read, especially when one of my favorite books is a teen-angst book called Temple of Gold.  At this stage of my life, I am more into figuring out why the author wrote it and wanted his readers to get out of it.  At first I was more or less disappointed because some of the characters and situations were overkill on awkwardness of Holden Caulfield's acquaintances and his analyzing of the everything in the minutae most all the time. Temple of Gold had much more realistic and a not-so much of a candy-ass of a protagonist.  I'm not going to go into all the nuances of the characters as you can read reviews here for that, but would like to think the reason the writer, J.D. Salinger hoped to get across, was after the writer who is basically writing an autobiography of himself, 'progressed' on after the story/life of a 17-year old, ended.  I think that came in the revelation of the Psychoanalysit Wilhelm Sketel whose quote which was a dichotomy of what Holden was and what Holden (as J.D. Salinger) became.---- &#34;The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.&#34;  Holden through his relationships and over-analyzing of absurd behaviours of himself and others was also this immature man who was battling his environment and status as a teenager.  His mature part was getting his readership to see this immaturity and see where it took him into a more noble calling of a mature person and writer.  Holden's only seeming hope as a redeeming value came in his passion in English and the only thing that kept him above a total, helpless, on-the-road-to-being, failure state.  Comin' Thro the Rye was a children's portrayed song highlighted in his book and on into the theme title of his book.  While somewhat noble in not having the children go through his immaturity by saving them from falling off the cliff into that vortex and poked at by his young sister, Phoebe toward the end; he starts to understand in the latter part of the book, the saving grace, where he actually 'misses' his phony/antagonistic people, and sees a window in setting goals as advice into not 'falling' to where he was at or heading; signifying the maturity to be had as future, mature writer, using his deficiencies as a revelatory understanding that would catapult into a career he could hang his hunting cap on, so to speak.  Page 150 is is important as this song from a young boy, a children's version of 'Comin' Thro the Rye' is symbolic for the theme and title.  It's about sexual wonderment at a young age which is about the immature aspect of growing up, and not especially the thought of leading the children, later, about leading them, especially, and protecting them from the phoniness or shallowness of adulthood.  Holden displayed what awkwardness relationships and sex are for all of us readers in their growing up.",2015-08-26

The plot can be easily summarized: a young man of about 17 years flunks out of his prestigious private school.  It is not the first time he's flunked out, so he is understandably reluctant to tell his parents.  Instead, he decides to use the 5-day examination period to wander about New York City (where he lives) to.... do stuff.  His plan is nebulous, even in his own mind, and at times ho ends up in a hotel bar, in his sister's room (he sneaks in without his parents seeing him), Central Park, etc.  However, the plot points are clearly not important because nothing much happens, and certainly the story is left unresolved, only covering Friday night to Sunday morning, so we never even get to the point of his parents finding out about his expulsion.<br /><br />Rather, the book is not what it is about, but rather how it is about it (to use one of Roger Ebert's pet phrases).  Written in a conversational style, with plenty of non-sequitors and copious swearing, it is meant to be more of a train-of-thought process as the young man goes about his days.  Unfortunately, I have always found this style hard to read, with its extra words, repetitions, and contextual slang.  For example, he will say things like, &#34;Boy, you should have been there.  You really should.&#34; - the entire prose is written in this style, and it is wearing to read.  Similarly, although there is swearing on every page, I think there is not a single F-word, the go-to choice of modern youth.  Instead, the book sounds (to a modern ear) very dated, or as if it was written by someone who is just imagining what youth talk like without actually speaking to any.... although, to be fair, linguists apparently agree that the slang is accurate for the age and time of the main character.  Perhaps it is inevitable that a book written in 1949 - one that was edgy and modern at the time - would feel more dated than &#34;classical&#34; literature.  For example, the language feels far more dated than in, say, The Great Gatsby, Dracula or even Jane Austin.  Along the same lines, even for the late 40's, the things that the main character disparages sound more like things someone the author's age, rather than the character's age, would hate.  For, me, it breaks the illusion to have the author speaking for the character rather than the character speaking.<br /><br />Returning to the original question: what is the book about?  Is it meant to be a gritty, realistic portrayal of a young man in his quest to find himself? - if so, he never progresses in his self-awareness.  Is it a polemic on the nature of man? - one of his primary trains of thought is that most people are &#34;phonies&#34;, i.e. we only do things to make ourselves happy, and if we do something &#34;charitable&#34; it's not through love of our neighbour but because it makes us feel better about ourselves.  So ultimately, I don't know what the book is about.  I suppose it's is interesting enough, and it doesn't outlast its welcome (at a mere 200 pages), but the narrator is somewhat unpleasant (as his sister points out, he hates everything) so we're once again left wondering why we have gone on this journey with him.  Perhaps it's just that the character doesn't speak to me.  Perhaps I've read enough teen angst books and seen enough teen angst movies that the subject no longer interests me.  Perhaps something that was &#34;edgy&#34; in 1949 is simply &#34;old-fashioned&#34; in 2015.  Whatever the case, for a book that is regularly listed as one of the 100 best in the English language, I would not recommend this book when there are many other classics more deserving (in my opinion) of your time.",2015-07-27

The entire story is narrated by Caulfield as he reflects back on a recent time in his life; taking place just after he is expelled from yet another prep school. It details his misadventures and observations of life from his outcast, and emotionally charged, perspective.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />First of all I just wanted to say this book is a classic written over 60 years ago with over 1.5 million ratings and nearly 35,000 reviews; and that’s just on Goodreads. In other words, I more than likely won’t say anything that someone hasn’t already said hundreds, if not thousands, of times. In light of this, I’m going to keep my review relatively short and to the point.<br /><br />First, to point out the elephant in the room, I love how relatable this book is, even 60+ years later. Teenage angst, in all it’s many forms, is pretty much timeless. The Catcher In The Rye does a fantastic job at showing just how emotional and overwhelming that time of life can be. It’s not prettied up to make it look like everything will be all right; it’s raw and realistic. The issues are presented just as they feel to Holden, just as they feel to many teenagers. And even if you’re not a teenager, and not able to relate to the book in the moment, you can reflect back and understand where he is coming from. For those who say “I never felt like that”, I get that, but I’m sure you knew someone who did. It’s not exclusive to how all people everywhere felt when they were Holden’s age, but it is a good representation.<br /><br />I keep bringing this up, but this book was written over60 years ago. To me, that’s amazing. This is one of those books that, aside from a few words and phrases, doesn’t feel like it was written more than 10 years ago. The Catcher In The Rye read like just about everything else nowadays, and I loved that. One of the reasons I don’t read as many classics as I should is that I hate Shakespearean lingo, and stuff like it. For me, it takes away from the story. If I have to spend time trying to understand what’s being said, as opposed to absorbing what’s happening, it wouldn’t be a book I’d tend to lean towards. In my opinion, this is one of the reasons that story is as timeless as it is. Anybody could pick it up and understand what’s going on.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the refreshingly raw look into a characters mind. Holden was troubled; he had his emotional demons. The fact that you’re able to read his train of thought, to have such a vivid look at his mindset, that’s what made it so special to me. One scene he’s going along happy and go-lucky, and the next he’s broken to the emotional core. That’s life. When things get Holden down, J.D. Salinger shows us the effect, he doesn’t just gloss over it. The emotional internal and spiritual struggles are real. The vulnerability is real.<br /><br />Finally, for all that this book is, I found it to be quite funny. Sure it was dry humor, but it still made me laugh out loud on a number of occasions. That’s what keeps it from being too emotional, too heavy.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />This is tough, because I really didn’t see anything particularly wrong with this book. In fact the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because it didn’t feel 5 star worthy to me. It’s not one of those things where I could tell you what went wrong.<br /><br />I know some people have a problem with it because they find the character too negative, and too unrealistic. That’s not an issue for me. I understand Holden as a character, even if I never really felt the way he did.<br /><br />I know people also disliked the fact that this book really didn’t have a beginning or ending; but that’s the point isn’t it? It’s a book that centers on the life of a teenager, for only a brief period of time. It really couldn’t have a true beginning or ending. It’s all about the there and now. Sure it points to the future, but only in regards to the feelings it brings up at that moment.<br /><br />Other:<br /><br />While I was reading this book, all I kept thinking about was that it’s a book about nothing. I mean yes at its core it’s about all the things I’ve mentioned above and many others, but generally speaking it’s about nothing in particular. And yet it’s so incredibly successful. Now why is that familiar? Oh yes, there was a little show about nothing; Seinfeld ring any bells? That was just a little successful too. In fact, if you look at it, you could say that Seinfeld is an adult version of this book, without as much emotional investment and more comedic value.<br /><br />I find quite humorous how ironic this book is. The thought of Holden being “the catcher in the rye”, wanting to save children’s innocence, save them from adulthood, all the while he’s the one with Peter Pan syndrome. He’s the one who wants to be a child.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />What can you say, The Catcher in the Rye is a classic any way you swing it. Love it or hate it, it’s been around for over 60 years and I don’t see that changing any time soon. It’s won an insane amount of awards, been on almost every top 100 must-read list and is relatable through the generations. At this point, if you haven’t already read it, just do it. You’ll either love it, or you won’t. I loved it, and can’t recommend it enough. Would I say it changed my life? No, but I understand how it could. They don’t call em classics for nothing.<br /><br />(www.FictionForesight.com)",2015-07-11

A tall, white, wealthy male would be the apex of power and prestige in that world.  And yet we have a teenage Holden Caulfield who is depressed and disappointed by the phoniness and ugliness of his surroundings.  If nothing else this novel reminds us that even those at the pinnacle of privilege  have death and loss to deal with.  Being  sensitive and alienated can happen to anyone.<br /><br />But it seems Holden takes things too far by flunking out of every school he is sent to and by failing to actually connect with anyone.  Only his ten-year old sister is able to charm him out of his self-destructive moods.<br /><br />Holden is a teen who sees grace and  nobility in his younger sister, and in the memory of a younger brother who has recently died.  At the previous boarding schools, a tormented student fell to his death, while wearing Holden's borrowed sweater. It's a graphic depiction of the thing Holden seems to want to do--catch children who are falling over the precipice from childhood to adulthood and save them--and therefore himself, before it  is too late. Holden can't seem to find a worthwhile adult to emulate anywhere.<br /><br />The language and the storytelling in this novel are brilliant.  Old Caulfield is not really a phony.  He smoked and drank, stayed up all night and traveled alone in ways contemporary teens raised by helicopter parents could never imagine.  It was fun to hang out with him and try to understand.",2015-07-04

The story is about how Holden gets kicked out of prep school for the millionth time and must go home to New York and tell his parents. He doesn't know what to do because his brother Allie recently passed away, and he can't put his trust in anyone except for his sister Phoebe, who is barely a kid. He doesn't know what to do with his life, and the only thing he does want to do seems like an ideal that can never be realized.  It is a very immersive and powerful novel, one that can open your insight to the cruel and overwhelming world around us.<br /><br />Note: If you are annotating this novel it is Definitely worth it to get the Paperback version instead of the Mass Market Paperback.<br /><br />This novel examines various themes that are critically important problems in society. One of my favorite themes in the novel is the idea of being &#34;phony&#34; or in other words being honest and sincere (or not). Holden always calls out others for being phony and can't stand them. However he himself is phony at times when he plays off these huge lies to people he doesn't even know.<br />Another huge theme that I love in this novel is the idea of being lonely, standing out, and not fitting in. Throughout the novel, Holden wonders where the ducks in Central Park go when the lake freezes over. This is beautiful, because it reflects Holden's own isolated image. He doesn't know where to go, because he doesn't belong in school, he has no work, and his parents don't want him home either.<br /><br />One of the most precious parts about this book, I think, are the moments when I read a sentence -Just one sentence- and I just sit there for a while reflecting on the true meaning of what Salinger's words and what he truly wants to tell us. One example of this is when Holden talks about the phrase &#34;Good luck&#34;. Read the novel to find out more!",2015-06-26

However the outstanding feature of this book to me personally has always been its ability to take the whole concept of 'coming of age' and present it as a caricature by using extreme situations. Holden's thoughts flounder as he takes irresponsible decisions and revisits his previous life to find solace and direction. The lines from which the book takes its title are very beautiful and perhaps pregnant with meaning. This is an absolute classic and a joy to read time and again.",2015-06-25

It follows 16 year-old protagonist Holden Caulfield’s, experiences in New York having been expelled from an elite college preparatory school. The books theme deals with feelings of adolescent alienation. Holden speaks out multiple times in the book against what he perceives as the “phoniness” of other, and expresses a desire to either opt-out of modernity, to instead live as a recluse in a cabin in the woods, or to immaturely die for a noble cause. Rebelling against our parents and/or society’s preconceived ideas of ‘the norm’ or success is not exactly a new idea in literature but perhaps no-one has done it quite so well as Salinger does here. Salinger belongs to the “stream of consciousness” school of writers and so his prose are marvelously fluid like the inner most thoughts of his character. A curious side-effect of Salinger’s style is that it almost gives the reader the impression that all is happening in real time. It is a warts-and-all approach to first person narrative complete with 1950’s slang (eg. Flit, Crumbum, Shoot the bull) and repetition; the former works to accentuate Holden’s troubled conscience or madness. The whole effect to me comes across like Jazz. I was reminded while reading of Kerouac’s quote “the only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live...” The books title is taken from the Robbie Burns poem “Comin thro the rye” (sung to the tune of ‘Auld Lang Syne’) as Holden misinterprets the lyric as &#34;if a body catch a body&#34; rather than &#34;if a body meet a body,&#34; (he keeps picturing children playing in a field of rye near the edge of a cliff, and him catching them when they start to fall off). They haven’t made any film adaptions of the book to date (at the time of this review)…But I couldn’t help, while reading, making parallels between this book and a film called “Igby Goes Down” and was pleased to see, when reading other reviews, that I wasn’t the only person to draw the comparison. The plot was fairly eventless for my taste (and I suspect most modern readers would agree) unless you consider run-ins with prostitute, pimps, and scoring whiskey at late night wine bars as story worthy. BUT without doubt this is a beautifully written novel – a must-read. I had a chuckle to myself more than once while reading this book and appreciating Holden’s slightly slanted (yet familiar) adolescent view point of the world.",2015-06-09

What I do remember is the controversy about this book in my home where my father deemed it NOT suitable for me to be reading. It was full of curse words, none of which I had ever heard in our home. There was mention of sex which was another taboo subject. But our teacher was fairly fresh out of college and she was looking to teach at least one au courant book from a touted living writer. I don’t actually remember how I got around reading it for my class....but I do recall the strife. (This same teacher also had us read Billy Budd by Herman Melville which we all pretty much hated back then. Perhaps that is due a reread also!)<br /><br />So now here I am many decades later, having raised four children through high school and college myself, and here still is Holden Caulfield cursing away and deploring all the “phony” people in his life. And now my heart goes out to this confused and lonely fellow as he tries to deal with the disillusions in his life. This book no longer has anything remotely shocking in it for me...only now I can truly see the anguish of this youngster trying to handle adolescence. Holden is a sweet kid whose character J.D. Salinger has totally nailed in this book and I can see why it garnered the attention it did. I often found the intensity of emotion and Holden’s blunt analyses quite funny in the way that extreme exaggeration often is when it is meant in all seriousness at the moment it is being mouthed.

Salinger, a high school challenged student Holden Caulfield talks about his difficult day while he stays in New York City. While he is there he experiences the phoniness of the society trying to deal with the death of his younger brother, overwhelming problems like getting expelled from his private school and horrible sexual experiences. The book is very easy to understand if you are a teenager because they are real life experiences. The book was over all an interesting book.<br /><br />Salinger's writing in this book is excellent, he has real life characters, that don’t really need to be explained. This book is basically about the struggles that young adults have. The Catcher in the Rye is a straightforward and easy to understand. It is anything but difficult. The Catcher in the Rye is a book that can be loved and but then again misunderstood on many different levels. The book The Catcher in the Rye was wrote with great detail and explains good imagery throughout the whole book. Towards the end of the book Holden describes him walking down the streets and talking to his dead brother and it was just great imagery.<br />The plot of the book was great. Even though the setting was for one or two days it was very detailed. The narrator is the main character himself and it makes the book very interesting from telling it from that view. Throughout the book Holden goes through hard obstacles. He has a lot of flashbacks in the book which sort of explains why he does the things he does. In the book it does get a little confusing with the flashbacks but for the most part you can tell where and what Holden is doing. It is kind of difficult trying to figure out when the climax is but the important parts are self-explanatory.<br />The book is an over all interesting book. There are lessons you can learn. The Catcher in the Rye explains how you’re not really alone even when you shut someone out. In the book multiple people try to reach out to Holden but he rejects it. The book is also interesting because of the point of view it’s told. Salinger uses the slang that a teenager would use in the 50’s, in the book and it’s but different. Salinger kind of made is character contradicting because throughout the whole book Holden says the society is phony but, multiple times in the book. One time in the book Holden says, “I am always saying &#34;Glad to've met you&#34; to somebody I'm not at all glad I met. If you want to stay alive, you have to say that stuff, though,” But things like that make the book something you want to read.<br />Overall you should really read this book. Even though in the beginning the book was designed for adults but later on young adults cached on. The book was rejected and banned because of the actions Holden does in the book like, skip school, drink, smoke, sexual activities and profanity.  You could understand why adults didn’t want teenagers to read this because teenagers could idolize Holden and want to be like him because teenagers are still trying to figure out who they are. This book should definitely be read and especially by teenagers because the book teaches you a lot.",2015-05-08

Our teacher could not seem to stress enough that this book is renowned as a masterpiece of American Literature. As we read the book many of us could not figure out why anybody could read this book, as it has an odd dialogue beings that it was written in the 1950’s. But as the teacher said, the book would eventually come together, just at the very end. After finally finishing it, I cannot personally say that is should be recognized as a “masterpiece” but it does teacher a valuable lesson that everyone can relate to, and for that reason, I can somewhat understand its importance.<br /><br /> The first thing about his book that you’re going to notice is the writing style of J.D. Salinger writing from the point of view of a teenager. Since the book is kind of dated, there are words and phrases that are presented to the reader that show its age. For instance, the very loose vocabulary of each characters speech are spelled out in such a way that the reader can easily imagine the exact way a character says it in their mind. Things such as “wuddayacallit” and “chrissake” and “helluva” can be seen throughout the book. Though this book is easy to read and even easier to follow, there are some phrases that are repetitive as Holden is often seen trying to emphasize what ever he is saying quite frequently. An example of this is “I really do” or “I really this” and “I really that&#34; can be seen on nearly every other page and gets old very fast.<br /><br /> As for the book itself, it is written as a first person account of past events that have taken place in the narrator’s life. At the very beginning Holden says that he is 17 years old explaining events that happened when he was 16. Reading through this book you will find that at each ending of each chapter there is no real personal reflection of the narrator until the very end of the book. It also does not attempt to wrap itself up to move on to the next set of events as most book seems to do. The story just seems to go continue on until the very end, as Holden just recollects each event in incredible detail. In my opinion, that was the hardest thing about reading this book, as there is nothing really spectacular or too interesting that seems to happen.<br /><br /> Despite this, there is a lot of controversy that surrounds this book for many reasons. Because of the content in this book, for a long time it was on the “banned book” list for school readings. A somewhat amusing thing about Holden is how much he curses. I am not over exaggerating when I say that there is a cursing on every single page of this book. If I could make a rough estimate of how much cursing there is in this book, I would say that at least 5% percent of every word in this book is bad. If you do the math, thats kind of a lot. But thats not the only reason that this book is surrounded with controversy. There have been a handful of murders associated or influenced with this book. Perhaps the most famous would be Mark David Chapman who patiently awaited for police to arrive after killing John Lennon, reading the Catcher and The Rye over his corpse. For some reason the influence of Holden Caulfield and his “everyone is a phony” mindset have inspired killer to try and assassinate other “phonies”<br /><br /> Regardless of what everybody is going to say, you are either going to love or hate this book. Me personally, I don’t like the story as much as I like the how it wraps itself at the very end. I cannot say without spoiling it, but the very last two sentences on the very last page is a truth that can be easily applied to Holden’s experiences as well as life. It can be perceived as both a happy and a sad ending and for that reason I think that The Catcher and The Rye deserves some recognition. I would not recommend this book to everybody, as some may not appreciate the point at the end as much as others would.",2015-05-07
US,1961267,R2JPUS0ZSP23DD,0316769487,862964341,The Catcher in the Rye,Books,4,0,0,N,N,"Many of us have had that stage and we know what it’s like to act this way","The book, The Catcher in the Rye, is about a 17-year-old boy named Holden reflecting upon what happened a year ago when he was 16. Holden has gone to stay with his brother, D.B., after everything that has happened to him when he was kicked out of Pency Prep High School a year ago. Throughout the entire book, Holden is reflecting on himself, the things that he did and the person that he was one year ago.    Many people who read this book thinks it doesn’t have any rising action/climax or that it’s plane Jane. Holden isn’t meant to be likable. Holden is a character that is being consumed by him coming of age and it’s a time in his life that he is not very likable. Many of us have had that stage and we know what it’s like to act this way. The Catcher in the Rye isn’t a book about someone you want to be like or someone you want to be with, it’s about who you once were. It’s about protecting ourselves from the unstoppable march into adulthood.    It takes a lot for Holden to sit down and write us everything he went through at the time. He went through things with a prostitute Sunny, the questions he asks the cab driver, the fact that when he goes to “give someone a buzz” he looks through his phone book hand has no one to call and his relationship with his family. These are emotional things that Holden shares and that takes guts to just share with anyone.  I think it was easy for me to relate to Holden. It’s easy to focus on how he is feeling and the way he explains everything. I find that it is interesting to think the way someone else does, that’s probably why I enjoyed it so much.    Overall, this book was interesting and I liked it. I do recommend it to those that are sick of reading the same thing all of the time. The Catcher in the Rye may not have many ups as it has downs but it gives an insight on what it’s like when you’re young.  To deal with many “phonies” and influences around you when you are young.",2015-05-07

He plays a character that is relatable to many teens which maybe why it appeals to many, but it did not appeal to me. Holden is a very mature teenager but has some issues mentally and with society and in this book I think he found his issues with society through his mental sorrow and expressed them to us which gave us the whole point of the book even though it wasn’t a very fast moving book.<br />This book did not catch my interest very well. In the beginning the book had some interest and some pace to it. I enjoyed hearing what Holden had to say about people and the world. Then about a fourth of the way through the book it flattened out and nothing happened that much. It was a very bland and monotonous book, and when I say monotonous I mean it felt like nothing happened or moved and it felt repetitive like just the same thing continuously.<br />What also didn’t help put the book into my list of favored, is I didn’t really connect with the main character (Holden). For me connecting is what makes the book. Holden had many problems throughout the book, and not just the book; his whole life seemed to have been surrounded with many conflicts. The conflict that he has gone through in life has made him the person he is today, and I haven’t gone through any of those problems so we aren’t the same kind of character.<br />The one thing that I liked about this book is the point of the book. I may have found a different point than what others may have but my point piggybacks off of the cover. In the book he sees himself as the catcher in the rye on the side of a cliff catching kids as they fall hence the name of the book The Catcher in The Rye.<br />I think the cliff symbolizes the “phoniness” of society and conformity. I feel like it also symbolizes the cliff of adulthood and he is saving the children from falling into the conformity and adulthood and phoniness of society.<br />My end review of this book is yes it is a good book, I would recommend you to read it if you can connect with the book. If you are like me and enjoy a book with some sort of pace and interesting parts then this book is defiantly not for you.",2015-05-07

From an outside view without the use of symbolism this book would have literally nothing. The novel uses a sense of mystery and letdown to provoke thoughts. The thoughts on this are all trying to decipher the mind of a teenage boy trying to cope with his life and the things in it. This could really had been an intense novel but, in my opinion, something outside of his own mind would have had to happen for that to occur for me.<br />Holden’s thoughts and feelings reign over this novel and there is nothing else in him, but views and beliefs. Holden’s actions are far from reality and a lot of crucial details I believe are hidden or discarded because of this being written by “Holden.” I feel as though any embarrassment or actual travesties in the life of the character could have easily been removed for sake of feeling ashamed. At the same time, this piques my interest slightly at all of the things that could be hidden under the shell.<br />We know that Holden does not like the though of change because nobody was there to guide him through his life except for Allie. But, within this novel Holden undergoes plenty of experiences and memories that will change him through his life. The life style that Holden choses to live also turns me off of this novel because there are some choices that he makes that aren’t the wisest. I don’t think that I really appreciate unwise people as for much more than just entertainment. But, this wasn’t meant to be entertainment<br />This book was meant to have an impact on some people and the only impact that I can see from it is co-dependence on people, which isn’t exactly a good thing sometimes. If you depend on someone your entire life, what are you going to do when they’re gone? But, I also admire this book for protesting both sides. Because it also promotes independence in Holden’s ongoing battle with his own mind and finding his way after Allie left.<br />I thinkthis book is a “literature masterpiece” because it’s not specifically about a turn of event or anything like that. It’s about an internal struggle and nothing else. This book is raw, it shows exactly the things that nobody wants to say that they’re thinking and some of them I am one to agree with. This novel comes across in a variant of different ways and I respect it for that. In the grand scheme, I believe it deserves to be noticed but not nearly to the power that it is. I believe this isn’t a book for the commoner because they’re not able to process most of the information in this novel.<br />The “Catcher in the Rye” could possibly be one of the longest lasting tales considering it’s meaningful and will always have an impact on young readers. The novel expresses powerful views such as independence that young people need so young people will continue to respect and view this novel as great and should generally be handed out in schools by the stacks.

This story entered the consciousness of a generation on a grand scale. And sadly, used as an excuse for murder, not once but three times. A novel to be read, put back on the shelf, and picked up again, to reveal yet another interpretation. Truly a force in modern, American literature. HoeThere has been and continues to be so much praise for this story, that reading it again as an adult, some thirty years later, I wonder why it reached such literary- cult- status. True, Salinger is a master of characterization, as Holden speaks personally to the reader, whining, speculating and lost in an adolescent phantasmagoria, wanting to make good on his narcissistic delusions of saving the innocent. Tell me about an adolescent male who hasn't had fantasies of being a hero and protecting the innocent.<br /><br />Catcher in the Rye is well written in the American Realist style, following Hemingway and perhaps, London or Fitzgerald. Similar to these popular American writers, they have universalized the zeitgeist of their particular generation. Salinger captured the voice of doubt, the angst of the American Sixties, that wanted to change the world, but ended up in the suburbs, raising kids and paying mortgages. More to the label of &#34;baby boomers&#34;, ex- hippies turned liberal democrat.<br /><br />Nothing really changed, civil rights and feminism yes, to a point, but fighting against the &#34;establishment&#34; brought nothing but violence, and now, post 9/11, we have come full circle, fascism in the guise of true freedom has arrived. Can Holden save us from the &#34;PATRIOT ACT&#34;? the &#34;HOME SECURITY' fellows, making true agitators disappear; running a Goebbels style propaganda campaign, promoting Torture as a legitimate tool in War? No, Holden's concerns are real, in the historical context in which Salinger wrote it. Today, though, it reminds us only about the innocence of the time, flowers, free love and hazy pot. We have all lost loved ones, this does not make us want to kill, yet Holden's perverse view of the world, made him want to murder. Unfortunately, too, this story has been the motivation or excuse for not one but three assassinations, a deluded one man's attempt at &#34;changing the world&#34;.<br /><br />As an idealistic teenager, living in a perceived perverse society, Catcher in the Rye made me feel a notion of connectedness.

The cab driver had it all wrong, and all Holden wanted was a straightforward answer. The mallards that fleck the North American landscape are sensitive to changes in the food supply and model their migratory patterns accordingly, not unlike Homo sapiens prior to the advent of agriculture. For most of their history, humans have hunted and gathered where there was food to hunt and gather, schlepping off to new haunts as the seasons and weather dictated.<br /><br />It's not that ducks don't have the ability to withstand the wintry conditions. Indeed, their thick feather coats serve as nature's perfect insulators. Rather, they follow the food. During the northeast winter, insects, fish and aquatic plants like duckweed become scarce as cold temperatures transform the local ecology.<br /><br />Annual changes in duck concentrations can also provide clues as to the cold conditions from which they flew. A harsher winter will bring more birds south to the Mississippi River Valley, for example, to feed on plants and grass not covered by snow and in open waters not glazed over with ice. Due to the weakening of the polar jet stream brought about by changes in the global climate, we've been seeing more ducks nestled along the southern locales of North America in recent years.<br /><br />That was all probably more than you wanted to know, but if someone had explained this to Holden in grade school it would have been one less thing bouncing around his busily eccentric mind.<br /><br />Troubled Youth<br /><br />Which brings us to Holden Caulfield himself and the man who created him. What strikes me about this novel is the nagging question of whether we are glimpsing inside the mind of Salinger or whether Holden is a cold-cloth fabrication. I suppose anything a person writes is a glimpse into their mind in a way, but we are always left to wonder how closely a book's characters resemble their creator. Is Holden's brooding disaffectedness a reflection of a lifelong angst and alienation suffered by Salinger?<br /><br />Salinger was of course the quintessential enigmatic recluse, but that hasn't stopped commentators from speculating. We know he was born and raised in New York City, that he performed poorly in school—so much so that his father sent him to military academy in Pennsylvania as a last resort—and that he later joined the Army during World War II. Like so many others, the war seems to have had a profound and lasting influence on Salinger, who was hospitalized for nearly a year in Nuremberg. The unauthorized biographer Ian Hamilton suggests Salinger suffered a nervous breakdown in July 1945, which may explain Salinger's letter to friend Ernest Hemingway in which he mentioned almost being discharged from the Army on psychiatric grounds.<br /><br />Autobiographical or not, Salinger's Caulfield is among those rarefied characters who have managed to compel readers for generations. Even those who don't necessarily connect with Holden tend to find his angst-ridden mirror on society irresistible. I don't see much of myself in his chronic repining over things big and small, and still I was drawn to him, like a car crash from which you can't quite look away. The &#34;plot&#34;, if we can call it that, hardly extends beyond the inner recesses of Holden's mind. Indeed, his vortex of dread and relentlessly wry running commentary *is* the plot. He's the directionless teenager we all love to hate, and I think it's because wrapped up in Holden's embittered, existentialist essence is a version of our past or present selves we can't help but identify with.<br /><br />I sincerely wanted Holden to course-correct and not let his overpowering discontent get the better of him. Maybe he would have been better off with a healthy dose of SSRIs and some counseling, or perhaps—given the subversionary role reversal in which he and his sister Phoebe are engaged in the closing section—he just needed to see himself from the outside looking in.<br /><br />The Streisand Effect<br /><br />I dug around a bit trying to find out why I didn't read this book in high school like everyone else. As it turns out, The Catcher in the Rye is one of the most censored books in U.S. history, which would certainly explain its absence on the reading list at the ultraconservative Christian school I attended.

It is one of those &#34;Life List&#34; books that I never read in high school but felt like I should.<br /><br />The novel is a Holden Caulfield’s narrative of two days that he spends on his own in New York City.  He has been expelled from yet another prep school, failing every subject but one.  After a fight with his roommate, he leaves school a few days early and goes back to New York City.  However, he knows that his parents will be furious about what happened and he chooses to spend a few days alone in a hotel before presenting himself at home for the holidays.  His two-day rebellion is spent going to nightclubs and getting drunk or wandering the city, continually bemoaning the lack of intellectual companionship.  He has a date with Sally, a girl from his past, and alternately falls in love with her and hates her… all on the same date.  He is a boy who is clearly never satisfied with anyone or anything, continually in a state of discontent.  His short time of rebellion has brought him no answers and no relief.<br /><br />I really wanted to love this book, or at least appreciate it, but I just couldn't.  It wasn't the dated language or ideas, but the complete lack of a character arc for Holden.  With most protagonists, there is a certain arc of growth that takes place as the character goes through different experiences and situations and becomes changed as a person by the story's end.  This really didn't happen with Holden and that lack of character growth is something that I came to realize I really appreciate in a novel and really missed in this one.  Holden is intelligent, but comes across as a bit arrogant, perhaps a little too obsessed with himself as a barometer of intellect.  For most of the book, Holden dismisses others as &#34;phony&#34; and casts aspersions on their worth if they don't live up to the personal standards he expects, standards that generally seem not to apply to himself.  Instead of relating to Holden's character, I found myself continually annoyed by him and his seemingly complete lack of self-awareness.  There was just no growth for Holden over the course of the novel, no change in behavior or thinking, no development.  Other than his little sister, Holden seems to struggle to truly connect with anyone on any level.  He spends most of the book whining about the fact that pretty much every person he meets is unintelligent and/or phony.  He sees himself as intellectually superior to most people, judging others as phony for their interest in things he sees as inconsequential.<br /><br />There is also much about his burgeoning sexuality and how that manifests itself, but there is never any development or resolution to that theme either.  It seems as if he is not entirely comfortable with his own sexual awakening, often commenting about his myriad of chances to lose his virginity that are foiled by himself.  He often objectifies women, but it is also clear that there is little behind it, more of an effort to fit in with the other guys in his school, rather than an accurate representation of his true feelings.  This is seen in his almost obsessive anger towards his roommate when he finds out that Stradlater’s date is Jane, a girl from Holden’s past.  He cannot stand the idea that Stradlater, a guy with a somewhat sketchy sexual history with women, would be with Jane, whom Holden seems to see as some sort of “above it all” standard of perfection.  His thoughts on sexuality seem to be rather disjointed, one moment bemoaning his lack of experience and the next almost frightened by it.  He does not push the issue with his dates and even during an encounter with a prostitute, he rebuffs the idea of intimacy, instead wanting simply to talk.  In keeping with his rather disjointed ideas are his judgments on others’ sexuality, often seeing others “perverted.”  There are also many moments when he questions the sexual orientation of those around him, showing a certain discomfort with the entire topic of sexuality.<br /><br />In some ways, though, iit was an interesting read.  The story is told as it flows from Holden's mind, at times very much of a stream of consciousness feel to it.  The flow was often a bit disjointed and almost reminded me of the flow of Anthony Swofford's Jarhead book.  But it is through this perspective and style of writing that we become privvy to the inner workings of Holden's mind.

And I loved it.  Well, not strictly nothing. I guess it’d be better to say that it isn’t a book about anything in particular. Not anything except Holden Caulfield, our teenaged protagonist, who spends quite a bit of time in his own head and not very much time actually going out and doing the things he thinks about. Holden pretty much IS the book. If you like him, you’ll enjoy “The Catcher in the Rye,” but if you hate him, you’re not going to have a very fun time.  Fortunately, I liked him.  Let me tell you a little bit about what Holden’s like. He attends a fancy prep school in Pennsylvania that he’s just been kicked out of – he’s a smart kid but not really up to things like doing his schoolwork or turning it in. Plus he’s got a little brother who died of leukemia, a big brother who’s off in Hollywood writing for film (much to Holden’s disgust), and a little sister who he loves to pieces. However, Holden doesn’t have an equally strong relationship with his parents, so he decides to leave school a few days before his eviction date and hang out in his hometown, New York, for a while. Anything’s better than where he is, right?  Not really. Holden thinks about calling up some girls he used to know. He thinks about hiring a prostitute, just to keep him company. He even thinks about going to live in the wilderness, because anything’s better than New York (except school, of course). But guess how many of those things he does? You’ll have to read the book for the exact answers, though. Some of them may surprise you.  Here’s what surprised me: liking Holden. If you don’t read this and think, “This kid needs some help,” you might need a little help yourself. But even psychologically messed-up people can be good and kind, and Holden’s got more than a little kindness in him. You can see it in the little sister he adores (I happen to be a huge sucker for guys who love their little sisters, or their mothers, or even their dogs). You can see it in the way he wants to punch the heck out of anyone who tries to mess with Jane Gallagher. And you can even see it in the way he talks to people he meets on the street – well, some of them. Like I said, the guy needs help. A lot of it.  But then again, so do most teenagers, whether it’s Holden’s kind of help or something a little more subtle. And really, anyone who recognizes that Romeo and Juliet are in lust, not love (as Holden does) is a lot better off than a lot of so-called “normal” people anyway.",2015-03-05

Salinger and was published on July 16th, 1951, by Little Brown in New York, NY. Holden Caulfield is the protagonist of The Catcher In The Rye. He is portrayed by Salinger as a boy who is lazy and uncertain about his future. The story begins at Pencey Preparatory school, where Holden attends. In this first-person narrative, Holden describes life at this preparatory school as phoney, artificial, and dreary. After receiving yet another set of failing grades, he is expelled from the school. In an effort to 'find himself', Holden decides to head to New York City. He narrates his adventures there in a 3-day flashback, which forms the basis of Salinger's story.  I would recommend this book to people in high school and older. The book is sometimes hard to follow and can sometimes get slightly boring. The book can be inappropriate at times, which makes me think that the book would be better for an older crowd.   The story is about a 16 year old boy named Holden Caulfield.  His story starts from a mental institution where he is currently undergoing treatment for a nervous breakdown which he suffered after being kicked out of Pencey Prep, the high school he recently failed out of.  He had been kicked out of other schools before this, he continuously fails time after time. He is suffering from deep grief over the death of his younger brother, Allie, who died from Leukemia three years ago.  He cannot connect with his peers, he has no real friends at school, he fights with or criticizes everyone around him. He runs away from school and heads to New York City. He sneaks into his own apartment when his parents are out, he enjoys seeing his little sister, Phoebe, the only person in the book who he really trusts. He is afraid to grow up, he does not want to be an adult.  He would rather remain a child.  He dreams of being a catcher in the rye, literally catching children as they fall off  a cliff that is a symbol for childhood.  Holden wantsto keep children in the innocence of childhood.   The writer, Salinger, has a very unique writing style that I enjoyed. He gave Holden a very dry sense of humor that most teenagers can relate too. \\""And I have one of those very loud, stupid laughs. I mean if I ever sat behind myself in a movie or something, I'd probably lean over and tell myself to please shut up.\\"" ― J.D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye. I find Holden to be a very realistic character that I think most people will like. As previously mentioned, Holden, the main character, is a 16 year old boy who dreads the reality of becoming an adult. He finds himself being depressed and lacking enjoyment in his life. Holden has never planned for his future and is now being forced to face it. He handles it by binge drinking and smoking, doing whatever he can to forget about his current problems.   Being the same age as Holden I found this book to be very relatable, with feeling the pressure of the future, dealing with our peers, and overcoming challenges from the past. His character changes drastically over the time period of the three days he writes about. Holden goes from a struggling teen in school, to a depressed, dependent almost adult like person. The book taught valuable life lessons and opens the eyes of the reader. Because of this, I think the book would make a great independent read for people my age.   Overall the ending of the book is somewhat predictable as you keep reading. I have an audience I would recommend the book too but I am worried that some may get bored by the book and not continue until the end, but the ending is what makes the book more memorable. That being said, the book is a classic that I feel everyone should read at some time in their life.",2015-02-24

Rather like &#34;y'know&#34; in so many young people's speech these days, it simply shows a lack of vocabulary and imagination on the part of the speaker or, in this case, the writer.

I was forced to read this in a high school English class years ago, and I was utterly devastated I had to read it again for a college English class that focuses on YA fiction. I honestly don't know how I stayed relatively composed the second time around. I think my eyes are screwed up from the constant rolling.    I'm happy to see that there are enough people who stand with me in saying how horrible this book is. I reiterate their message in saying that it has no plot. Instead it is nothing but a rambling account of a teenage boy's stay in New York City after flunking out of his third or fourth prep school. Holden Caulfield is an immature, thoughtless, oxymoron of a human being that obviously is suffering from bipolar disorder. It's his constant mood swings that are the majority of filler for this so called classic. And I say he is an oxymoron because he hates everything in this world that he does himself. For example, he hates liars and calls them bastards, but I eventually lost count on how many lies he told to people. Also, he is shocked and offended when he sees the phrase \\""F@%* you\\"" scribbled on walls in his sisters school, when it was his sister who told him to quit swearing when he was with her hours earlier. If this is the quintessential coming of age novel that everyone is calling it, then I'm terrified that there are teenagers out there that are just like Holden.    Salinger's style of writing for this novel is too repetitive and lazy. It may be impossible to count how many times something \\""killed\\"" Holden or drove him crazy. The word \\""really\\"" was constant as well, like \\""I hated it. I really did\\"" or \\""it really was\\"" or \\""I really do\\"".

Salinger creates a narrator who is universally relatable to adults as well as adolescents; Holden Caulfield is an emotionally damaged teen who is struggling to come to terms with his younger brother's death. While he is recovering, he loses his ability to connect to others emotionally, and his academics have suffered because of this. After being expelled from yet another boarding school, Holden brings the reader on a journey through Manhattan while he attempts to connect with women sexually, and to create friendships.  Holden purposely isolates himself from others because he is afraid to make an emotional connection; his method f protecting himself quickly creates a cynical outlook of the world, which is how he pushes people away so effectively. However, Holden's main emotion in the novel is loneliness. This emotion drives him to connect with others, but his fear of connection prevents him, causing him more pain.  This novel is an accurate account of how emotional pain can lead to isolation and depression. Many people, adults and adolescents alike, suffer because of the loss of a loved one. Because Holden exhibits these qualities, people can relate to his struggle on a personal level. Even if a person does not have emotional pain, they will be able to relate to Holden's bipolar mood swings because most teenagers have experienced those emotions. All in all, the Catcher in the Rye is a novel that anyone who reads it can relate to, and recites an intriguing journey of a teenager attempting to obtain a meaningful connection with a person .  I strongly recommend that everyone read this novel because it can be an inspiration and comfort to anyone undergoing personal troubles and grief.",2015-01-07

The protagonist, Holden Caulfield, is a man whom no one understands and who feels isolated inside his own world. This character is very similar to Christopher McCandless from the novel Into the Wild. The book is easy to read and understand, with not too complicated vocabulary. There is a lot of dialogue which is refreshing and interesting, more so than reading inner thoughts pages at a time.<br /><br />Before I started reading this novel, I wish I knew what time period the novel was set in. The only indication is in the quote: &#34;He got leukemia and died when we were up in Maine, on July 18, 1946.&#34; This sentence would be easy to look over and not think about the significance. Other than this, there is no clear indication of the time period as the details of time are very vague. However, the time period is not extremely important to the story.<br /><br />This book would be good for someone who is interested in stories in which the protagonist has a major inner conflict with himself in a completely realistic story that could happen to anybody. If one was a fan of the book Into the Wild, then The Catcher in the Rye would be a good choice. However, there is some harsh and inappropriate language so I do not recommend this novel for young children.<br /><br />I gave The Catcher in the Rye 4 out of 5 stars because knowing the time period of the story is very important to me so I can be completely immersed in the novel. I glazed over the one mention of the time period so I was left in the dark for the entire novel.

But it's so damn stupid to read about this spoiled, privileged, and idiotic boy criticizing everything because they don't meet his BS standards. Pretty much, I want to grab Holden by his labels and encourage him to get a gun and have an accident with it.<br /><br />All in all, I wish The Catcher in the Rye was a baseball book that many thought it was.",2014-12-31

To many that spells trouble but to me it sounds like the perfect recipe for a captivating book. Most think it is a good idea to sugarcoat books but I like the honesty and themes that are portrayed in the stories like Catcher in the Rye. It doesn’t shy away from realistic scenarios like under aged drinking, troubled school dropouts, or insane asylums. The story’s New York in the 1950’s setting paints the scene for Holden Caulfield and his troubles. His first person flashback narrating gives us an in depth look at his personality and reasoning for things but even with the narration type we are still left with questions and curiosity about Holden because of things he does not reveal to us or things he doesn’t even understand himself. Even with this book’s edgy atmosphere many of the themes displayed throughout the story are types of innocence that Holden shows whenever faced with a strange or different situation he isn’t familiar with. At one point Holden is in his hotel room in New York and pays a prostitute, she doesn’t appear to be any older than him and sge refuses things like a cigarette and informs Holden she doesn’t smoke “It was a funny thing to say. It sounded like a real kid. You'd think a prostitute and all would say ‘Like hell you are’ or ‘Cut the crap’ instead of ‘Like fun you are.’” Another theme that arises is the theme of love or lust when Holden is constantly thinking about an ex-girlfriend of his and he is constantly faced with situations that force him between the two. All together I thought the book was a fantastic story that let the character fully develop and showed us his angel and devil on the shoulder type of personality.",2014-12-18

This is one of the best books I have ever read, and I was so entertained by Holden, and his mentality. So good.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />Like I said before, Holden was absolutely hilarious. Whenever he said that he was doing something, &#34;like a bastard&#34; I died laughing. His overall outlook on things is very negative, and I really found it entertaining. Also, I think I am Holden Caulfield, so I can't really say anything bad about him without insulting myself too. And honestly, that would be pretty phony of me.<br />The book was so fast. It literally took place over like two or three days, but it felt like it was a month. I loved it.<br />I'm just going to be vain for a second, and say that I LOVED HOLDEN'S HAT!<br />I just loved the direction that the story moved in. It was really what I wanted to happen, and honestly for Holden's development as a character and as a person, it needed to take that direction.<br />All the symbols, and themes, and metaphors, and all the other literally devices really killed me.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />That ending really killed me.

I just couldn't handle when she was around, and I just thought her overall demeanor, while she was somewhat close to Holden, was annoying.<br /><br />To sum this review up, I wish I would have bought the trade paperback rather than the mass market one because I just love this book so much that I think that I should have the nicest copy possible.",2014-12-08

He ends up getting a crappy hotel room before going out on the town to drink, smoke, and he even ordered a hooker.

US,32496153,R1SX31KZ3PT6E6,0316769487,862964341,The Catcher in the Rye,Books,5,4,5,N,N,"The most misunderstood book in all of literature...","There is a literary critic named Robert Paul Lamb who wrote two superb books on Ernest Hemingway (you can find them [[ASIN:B0043M5RPY here]] and [[ASIN:B00AMM5OB6 here]] ). In the introduction to the first book, Art Matters, Lamb tells a story: when he was young he loved the writing of Ernest Hemingway but, when he got to graduate school, he began to read more \\""sophisticated\\"" writers - or writers who were deemed more sophisticated by the academy - authors like William Faulkner and James Joyce. Lamb still cherished Hemingway but he began to look down on him to some degree as less sophisticated or as less of an artist. Lamb wound up rereading Hemingway later in life, rediscovered his artistry, and he wrote two books analyzing Hemingway's craft - and I think they are two of the best books of literary criticism I have ever read (and I have never liked Hemingway all that much).<br /><br />I had a similar experience with The Catcher in the Rye. I read it as a teenager and I loved it. I then read it again in my early twenties and I still loved it. For a long time I would have considered it my favorite work of fiction. Then I went to school for philosophy and I also began to read \\""more sophisticated\\"" writers like William Faulkner and James Joyce. I still held a special place in my heart for The Catcher in the Rye but I also felt as if I had outgrown it to some degree. I think that is the image that a lot of people have of this book: that it is a book for angsty teenagers and, once you are past that stage, it no longer has the same impact. I think that is totally wrong - I think this book has as much substance as any work of fiction ever written - and, strangely enough, it was William Faulkner himself who convinced me of that.<br /><br />I was browsing through a volume of William Faulkner's lectures [[ASIN:0813916127 Faulkner in the University]] and I noticed that Salinger was mentioned in the index, and I found this quote, \\""I have not read all the work of this present generation of writing...So I must speak only of the ones I do know. I am thinking now of what I rate the best one: Salinger's Catcher in the Rye, perhaps because this one expresses so completely what I have tried to say: a youth...must someday be a man, more intelligent than some and more sensitive than most, who...because God perhaps had put it there, loved man and wished to be a part of mankind, humanity, who tried to join the human race and failed. To me, his tragedy was not that he was, as he perhaps thought, not tough enough or brave enough or deserving enough to be accepted into humanity. His tragedy was that when he attempted to enter the human race, there was no human race there\\"" (244).<br /><br />And, speaking about Holden Caulfield, Faulkner said \\""his story was an intelligent, very sensitive young man who was - in this day and time was an anachronism, was almost an obsolescence, trying to cope with a struggle with the present-day world which he was not fitted for, when he didn't want money, he didn't want position, anything, he just wanted to find man and wanted something to love and he couldn't. There was nothing there. The nearest he came to it was his sister who was a child and though she tried to love him she couldn't understand his problem\\"" (246-247). I think Faulkner's comments on the book are quite insightful - they completely contradict all the negative reviews of this book that label Holden Caulfield a \\""spoiled brat\\"", etc. - and they convinced me to reread the book and, far from finding that I had \\""outgrown\\"" it, I found that many of its profoundest and most beautiful aspects had escaped me in my first two readings. I would like to share some of them.<br /><br />The story is obviously about Holden Caulfield. Holden is obviously a depressed and lonely teenager. Many people who read the book feel Holden's loneliness is a result of a kind of misanthropy - he hates people, he finds them all \\""phony\\"", and he cannot stand to be around them. This is why, I think, some people seem to have such a negative reaction to the book and wind up dismissing Holden as just a spoiled brat. I am not a developmental psychologist but, at least in popular consciousness, we all seem to believe that teenagers go through a phase where they hate everyone and think they are smarter than everyone. This book is often dismissed as being nothing other than an expression of that attitude, but I think that is a total misreading of the book. People who read the book in that way never stop to ask \\""What is it that Holden \\""hates\\"" about humanity?\\""<br /><br />Well, Holden hates \\""phoniness\\"". But what does he mean by phoniness and why does he hate it? He hates that, in all of his social interactions, people are always putting on airs, trying to impress. What Holden craves is some kind of genuine human interaction, something beyond showing off. He is looking for the genuinely human which is why I think what Faulkner has to say about the novel is spot on. He loves that his old girlfriend Jane used to refuse to move the kings in the back row when she played checkers. The fact that Jane refused to move her kings is something that makes her unique, but no one else seems to care about it or find it interesting. For Holden, other people's values are misaligned: people are impressed by someone who is strong, excels at academics, can throw a touchdown pass, but they ignore and find no value in our shared humanity, in our shared weaknesses and idiosyncrasies. Stradlater does not care that Jane does not move the kings in the back row, he just wants to sleep with her, and in order to do so he plays a game, puts on a facade, etc. It does not matter to him that there is no genuine connection as long as he gets what he wants.<br /><br />That is what Holden hates, and it is why he gets in a fight with Stradlater. Far from being a sign of Holden's \\""hate for humanity\\"" it is a sign of his \\""love for humanity\\"". He loves all the things about people that everyone else finds worthless. He loves their eccentricities, their vulnerabilities, their weakness. He does not care about all the things that people like to brag about. He cares about what makes us human and unique. The reason he is disgusted by humanity is because he cannot find anyone else in the world who values those things. Society destroys the weak. He tells a story about a fellow student in his speech class The student was a nervous, shy type, but when he would go off on tangents about his uncle he would get excited and animated - he was talking about what he loved. Rather than encourage that, the students were taught to yell \\""digression\\"" whenever the speaker went off topic. The process of socializing a human being into a productive member of society - someone who stays on topic - is deemed more important than encouraging an individual's unique humanity. That is what Holden finds disgusting.<br /><br />All through the book, Holden is desperately trying to find some genuine connection with someone, to have a social interaction that is not based purely on trying to impress or outdo one another - and he fails. He attempts to express his despair, but no one is capable of reading the subtext of what he is saying - it all just leads to more misunderstanding. He is talking with Sally Hayes and he starts to form all these plans about running away to the wilderness with her. The subtext of what he is saying is, \\""I am miserable! I need to get away from this suffocating atmosphere!\\"" but Sally does not hear any of that. All she can think of are all the practical problems with Holden's plan. Instead of trying to comfort him or telling him things will be okay - which is what he really needs to hear - she starts to poke holes in Holden's plan, which only increases his despair. The book is full of poignant and beautiful moments - glimpses of our shared humanity, which is usually hidden behind the masks that we put on. Holden is like someone searching for a flower in an industrial wasteland and, whenever he thinks he sees one, someone comes along and stomps on it out of carelessness, or rips it up by its roots, or simply ignores it. This book is NOT a denunciation of humanity - it is a cry for humanity, and a very moving (and funny) one.less. He loves their eccentricities, their vulnerabilities, their weakness.

Holden uses outdated slang, which may be semi-confusing to the modern teenager.<br /> And yeah, Holden does whine. To be short, the book isn't very modern, and it may be hard to see how it could be useful today.<br /> However, Holden is very well written. In most books, I have a hard time feeling like the character is real, and they usually feel sort of... fake, as if they don't have a voice. Holden has a very strong voice. He curses a lot, complains about things, makes random observations, etc. I mean, the first page has him complaining about things he hates. The book does a good job of making him feel real, of giving him a voice. The way the story is told makes you feel like your Holden's friend, and he's talking directly with you. The first sentence in the book goes, &#34;“If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.”<br /> And yes, although it is a very outdated sort of novel, the character of Holden, his way of thinking, his voice, how he does things, are VERY modern and relevant, and could very easily apply to today's teenagers. I know. I'm currently 15, and I can honestly say, some things Holden says sounds creepily like something kids in my high school, or my friends, or even myself may say or think. Trust me, I'm almost 16, I can truly vouch that this is some of the things we think.<br /> Holden speaks to issues relevant to my generation; fear, anger, sexuality, smoking, drinking, depression, loneliness, hating yourself and most things, loss of innocence, love, relationships, etc.<br /> This is probably one of my favorite books, as he's a character I believe we all can relate to, at some point in our lives. I will be the first to say that, no, it's no longer modern or controversial. Part of the problem is time. Much more relevant books (like 'Perks of being a wallflower&#34;, for instance) are out there, with modern slang, and a relatable setting (unlike in New York, where the story takes place.) Another is acceptance by adults. Part of what made &#34;Catcher&#34; great is that no adult liked it, back then. It was rude, had copious amounts of smoking, drinking, cursing, etc. Now that we're in a slightly more liberal age, this is less shocking, and unfortunately it's become a &#34;classic&#34;, aka a book no kid will like. By assigning it, teachers took away its power and message.<br /> It's still an amazing book, tho. Read it. Try to get past the datedness, and focus on Holden's message. You probably won't, tho. &#34;People never notice anything.&#34;",2014-10-19

Caulfield expresses both contempt and admiration for people and situations he encounters, and describes his annoyances, bewilderment, insecurities, frustrations, sadness, and pleasures in infinite and exhaustive detail. At various times throughout the novel, Caulfield dons a red hunting hat, positioned in such way to reflect and assert his state of mind at any given time.<br /><br />Very easy reading, albeit tedious at times.

But, I’m glad I finally gave it my time and not just to say “Catcher in the Rye, of course I’ve read it” with that phony tone of voice that Holden Caulfield would’ve g*dd@m hated.<br /><br />I admit that early on I really didn’t understand all the accolades that surrounded Salinger’s most popular novel. Holden appeared to be a whiny, judgmental, young man who swore too much, smoked too much, drank too much, and needed a serious come to Jesus talk, yet the adults in his life that seemed to care were dismissed as soon as they tried to do so.<br /><br />Then Holden makes an impulsive decision that eventually sends him spiraling, revealing a sensitive young man crying out desperately for help. Salinger carefully sets up Holden, and the readers, to finally acknowledge that this soulful boy is broken.<br /><br />Catcher in the Rye tore at my heart, making me ache for this child, that tragedy seemed to follow like a shadow.",2014-10-02

I'm glad I waited until now, at the age of 54, because if I had read it in high school, I would have absolutely and unreservedly detested it --- in fact, I would have simply refused to continue reading it after the first few pages, so rife it is with profanity, dumbness, laziness, meanness, and tons and tons and TONS of teenage angst.  For some bizarre reason, however, reading it at age 54, I couldn't put it down.  For one thing, it was just darned funny in spots.  It is difficult to make me laugh, but this book actually had me laughing out loud.  Yeah, the main character is repetitive and annoying and utterly unjustified in his general contempt for virtually everyone and everything in the world, but he is extremely insightful in his own way, and I just had to keep reading, to find out what the next insightful or bizarre thought would be going through his head.

I won't &#34;Spoil&#34; it for you, lol and wont tell you in order the events take place.<br /><br />What can you say about the #1 banned book in public school libraries and maybe even libraries period.  You can say this---even after all these years, it still sells millions of copies all over the world.  Rather than ban the book, and pretend life is not difficult sometimes, I think schools should read and discuss, and maybe talk about ways various things could be handled, how to get help, who to turn to, etc.  In a nutshell, the reason its banned isn't because of language, sex, drugs, rock and roll, its banned because its about a teen age boy who is expelled from school (numerous times) and doesn't seem to like anyone or anything.  He is very critical and very disillusioned with life and how &#34;phony&#34; people become.  He leaves the school a few days early and its Christmas time in NY so its cold.  He left impulsively and doesn't know what or where to go.  He goes to a teacher he liked and who he trusts only to find a strange  situation that scares him so he leaves.  goes to a hotel and has a hooker come to room, and he realizes he is afraid of (he is a virgin) sex, and decides he just wants to talk.  She is angry about the time he is taking, (she has customers waiting) so he pays her the  agreed upon money and she is angry and sends her pimp up to get more.  Calls an old girlfriend, but that doesn't work out too well, so He goes home and sneaks in the house (mom and dad cannot know he is home because they will wonder WHY==and sees his sister.  She knows immediately and says &#34;dad will kill you&#34;, (figuratively not literally) and they come home, so he hides and then sneaks out.  He is so negative about life, but he loves his family and he has dreams for the future.  Some are unrealistic, but he dreams.  The title came from a song he heard children singing and the answer to a question a date asked him after she said you don't like anything and want to be nothing , and he said yes I do, so she said, &#34;name one thing&#34; so he expalins.

And that caring about people is not that challenging when you are able to see people as perfectly imperfect. That is that their &#34;flaws&#34; increase their likeableness because they are what makes them who they are. Holden teaches us how to have the ability to adore everyone even in the midst of them being on the surface as potentially unlikeable. Holden teaches us the golden value of having a passion for the truth as he takes us on a journey of honest to goodness truthful conversations. He teaches us how refreshing conversations can be when both parties are willing and able to be honest with one another and how unenjoyable conversations can be when one or another in the conversation speaks pretentiously and how that type of attitude can really deflate the potential joy of that opportunity within those brief moments that those people have to celebrate being in the company of one another. Through honesty, adoration, a celebration of his own perfect imperfections and a deep desire to take care of all human beings as if they all have something important to contribute to the world (When asked by his sister Phoebe what he would most like to do in life Holden answered about people playing in a rye field near a cliff.. &#34;I'd have to catch everbody if they started going over the cliff...That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be.&#34;) Holden teaches us how to more greatly enjoy our journey of life with one another and how to be passionate about being a great friend. It is additionally amusing to me that Holden at times seems to have little reverence toward religion itself yet at the same time is very Christlike in his adoration and appreciation in his hindsight of all of the people in his life. In a way this &#34;qualifies&#34; Holden as a lover of us all and makes him an excellent candidate to be &#34;The Catcher in the Rye&#34;.his &#34;qualifies&#34; Holden as a lover of us all and makes him an excellent candidate to be &#34;The Catcher in the Rye&#34;.",2014-09-02

From what I remember, Holden thought everyone was phony, but there wasn't really any indication people were acting as a &#34;phony&#34; toward hm. In the beginning his roommate was friendly toward him, and though Holden believed he was a phony, didn't give any solid examples. The same with the Professor in the beginning of the book. Holden believed the Professor wasn't sincere, but Holden doesn't provide any instances when the Professor actually acted in a two-faced manner. It appeared to me that Holden was the phony, never expressing how he felt about them, and always assuming people were two-faced, when in reality, Holden was the one being two-faced by hiding his negativity and true feelings about the people he was interacting with.<br /><br />Regardless of the interpretation, I did enjoy the book.

During this book, I felt that the reader gradually uncovers the ‘human’ beauty that lies deep within the protagonist Holden Caulfield’s nature -Holden being a seemingly troubled and somewhat unstable youth at initial introduction. As I progressed through The Catcher in the Rye, I found Holden Caulfield gradually become quite endearing, my perhaps initial concern for the boy being thwarted over time as he became more and more likeable to me – perhaps in a similar way to Holden’s own mentality as he described in the book being simply that coming to like others seems to just be a progressive thing. But more so, I feel the gradual likeability of the guy is relatable to the way that he engages in seemingly reckless behaviours but always shows a degree of integrity in each situation. E.g calling up a female friend drunk and offering to help her cut her Christmas tree, or soliciting a prostitute but wanting no more than to just have a chat.<br />I would relate the feeling throughout this book as bittersweet, but I'd have to say that the feeling you are left with after reading the final chapters of this book is sentimental warmth, drawn personally by uncovering along the way, the sympathetic and warm-hearted nature of the lad. Holden may drink, he may smoke, he may take things to extremes, he may at times show complete disregard for others, and he may have no idea about his life's direction – in modern context it’s troubling that he is doing this and is only 17 - but deep down in there, these acts don’t seemingly demean his character whatsoever as his men’s-rea is integrity and of definite conviction. Holden is also quite intelligent and is capable of intellectual interaction as illustrated when he seems to grasp philosophical concepts andcontribute to the discussion he has with Mr. Antolini – a teacher he previously admired and finds himself with one evening.<br />Holden overall displays a human; loving and somewhat compassionate character and spirit. It's the recognition of this; of the little sparkling gems that shine through in Holden's character as you get to know him along the way, that is reassuring, pleasing and simply lovely. It was a good book suited for young and old - disclaimer: above the age of 16 perhaps.",2014-07-29

They’ll rip you a new one.<br /><br />The book is written in first person but for the life of me I could care less for this sniveling, whiny rich kid, Holden Caulfield. Everything he wants is giving to him on a silver platter and by choice, he continually self-destructs the options. How are we to feel empathy for a person who continually sabotages his own life?  I can’t think of one.<br /><br />Now, if Mr. Caulfield was the recipient of being bullied or beaten up by no accord of his own, that’s different. Not the case here. He ruins what few relations he has by being, for a better term, a spoiled little brat and then whines about it. How sad. Too bad. You cry wolf one too many times and no one cares. He is a master at that.<br /><br />The only saving grace of this rubbish is the final two sentences. If you can find a copy or even better, go to the local library and read those lines, it will save you a lot unwanted rambling.<br /><br />Two star push",2014-07-09

In fact, for years I assumed that it was a book about baseball. There's not much I can say about it that hasn't already been said - along with &#34;Moby-Dick,&#34; &#34;The Great Gatsby,&#34; and &#34;Huckleberry Finn,&#34; it's a contender for The Great American Novel, which puts it in the running for The Greatest Novel in the World, going head to head with works by Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Austen, and other classics. But in addition to its secure status as &#34;a classic,&#34; it's also, reportedly, the Favorite Novel Ever of every thoughtful teenager born from 1935 to the present. Yet strangely, I don't recall any of my friends discussing it when I was growing up - it was always adults who mentioned it. Is it possible that &#34;The Catcher in the Rye&#34; was NEVER the favorite book of any teenager, but instead, the book that older people simply assumed would appeal to teenagers? That despite the condemnation of Holden as a &#34;bad influence,&#34; in fact, he didn't influence anyone - adults only thought that he did. Given the author's notorious reclusiveness and his slender output, a mythology grew up around the book all out of proportion to its objective quality - like Darwin's &#34;The Origin of Species,&#34; a book more a catalyst for argument than a work of literature that people actually read.<br /><br />That being said, it wouldn't have turned into a cultural icon if a lot of people hadn't read it and been moved and inspired by it. But reading it for the first time as an adult is different - Holden wasn't my contemporary; he was someone I had moved past a long time ago.<br /><br />I wouldn't have cared for Holden, and he wouldn't have liked me at all. Far from seeing everyone as a &#34;phony,&#34; I ascribed far too much authenticity to everyone at that age. I took everything everyone said very seriously, even if I disagreed with them. Not to say that I was a serious person - far from it. I was known as a clown and a joker. But everyone else seemed to be clear on what they wanted and who they were - they were all confident, secure, and in control, whether they were a jock, a brain, a tortured artist, or just an ordinary slob, content with whatever life allotted them. If only I had understood how frightened and confused everyone else was - at least, some of them. But I was too easily influenced by everyone around me, unlike Holden, who doesn't seem to be truly influenced by anyone. And the only reason for this is absolute, complete, total arrogance - he may be the most arrogant and conceited character in all literature, at least in proportion to his relative unimportance in the larger society he inhabits.<br /><br />&#34;The Catcher in the Rye&#34; is, above all, the portrait of a single individual, and not a commentary on mid-century American society, as &#34;Huckleberry Finn&#34; is on the American society of a hundred years earlier. And it is certainly not a general commentary on the human condition, as &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34; is. And it doesn't explore human relationships in the depth Austen does, or have the historical and religious weight of the Russian masters. But it does what all great literature must do - it forces the reader to engage, to come to grips with something, to either agree or ask themselves why they do not agree - and for that reason, despite its limitations and the danger of its being overwhelmed by the hype surrounding it, it is, in fact, an important work that anyone who considers themselves a cultured or thoughtful person should be familiar with.city to everyone at that age.

While many analyze this book in regards to teen angst, do not feel it need be over-analyzed.  It is a wonderful, colorful story of a young man's descent into mental illness.  I felt Holden Caulfield was once a somewhat popular young man who drifted away from conventional society.  As with many who are mentally ill, he had little awareness of this. He struggles with his relationships, hoping to remain an innocent.  Very well written.  Truly deserves to be a classic.

Don't think of it in terms of a classic book, but just another book. Reading it then becomes more about the story itself instead of an evaluation of its classic status and whether or not it's deserved.<br /><br />A major criticism I have heard about this book is that it doesn't go anywhere. It is essentially the ramblings of a 16 y/o about the weekend he left school after he knew he was going to be kicked out. He makes a lot of digressions along the way getting off topic before getting back on. For many people, a story should go somewhere. A person should have accomplished something along the way, or transform by the end.  Holden pretty much ends up the same as he started (the end suggests that he's on the road to growth but we don't see any of it throughout the pages). But rather than this being a plot-driven or character-driven novel, I'd call this a character study.<br /><br />Another criticism is that Holden Caulfield isn't a likable character. For most people, he probably won't be. But I don't think it's a requirement that characters always be likable so much as it's important for them to be relatable. I can relate to the level of angst he has even if I don't relate to how he reacts to it. Like for all his disgust with the phoniness of adults, he's complicit and phony just as well. My favorite example is when he's talking about him and a Navy officer telling each other how \\""it's nice to have met you\\"" a social nicety with virtually no weight to it the majority of the time it's being said.<br /><br />The content can feel repetitive at times, but I was always curious to see how things progressed.

Everything Holden did was for himself, or by his own thinking. He doesn't seem to understand what he is doing wrong, but keeps doing the same thing.<br />  His tendency to the words phony, or fake also make him seem even more above his own laws. He hates everything he believes to be phony, but is actually the biggest liar in the book. He has a really terrible way of covering for it, too,&#34;I swear I'm a madman sometimes.&#34; He's a madman all the time and doesn't even realize it.<br />  He also has a terrible way of dealing with stress, or bad situations. He either assumes the absolute worst, or that everything is okay. He assumed his teacher was going to rape him after he had given him advice, and decided to pet his head, which is really just a form of care. His teacher had just given him some very serious advice in a very serious situation. But before that he is telling Phoebe that his parents won't kill him, even though he just got kicked out of ANOTHER school.<br />  He also cannot seem to believe how bad people can be. The entire time Maurice is scamming him for an extra 5 dollars, he cares more about being right than his safety. He then expects someone he exclaims as dumb, to be smart enough to run away with him even though he does not want her to. He doesn't even understand himself.<br />  But honestly he does seem to have a certain charm about him. He has so many bad things about him that anyone can pick up the book and at least relate to him in some way. It was brilliantly written to make as many people as possible pick it up and keep reading.

The story was so lame, and they characters half cocked ideas. I entirely regret ever participating in the class project involving this book.

I just can't enjoy a book completely about the boring, sad, unimportant life of some spoiled rich kid who thinks he has it rough.<br />  The only time I could relate to this book was when his brother died and when the kid killed himself. I had a brother that died, and the entire time I was reading this book I wanted to kill myself. I felt like so much of my time was wasted.

It's a great book that focuses on a seventeen year old school drop out named Holden Caulfield as he wanders around New York trying to get somebody to listen to him but he ends up just feeling more and more alone. I believe that anybody who is at least seventeen can easily relate to Holden and find a bit of him in them. That's why this book is so popular with people today. This is a book about the problems that haunt all adolescents as they mature into adulthood.<br />For a while as I read this book I didn't like it that much only because I didn't get it at all. You can't just read any book without thinking deeply about what every little thing means. Once I took the time to think about this book I began to like it more and more. For example the outlandish red hunting hat that holden constantly wears shows that Holden wants to be different from the people around him at the same time he is very self conscious about it. The hat sort of mirrors the main conflict of the book which is Holden's need for isolation versus his need for companionship.<br />I also didn't like the book as much because I thought it lacked a plot and a good ending. But I couldn't have been more wrong. It has a great plot and an even greater ending. As I continued thinking about this book I started thinking about the two different Holdens in this book. There is the Holden that the story is about and the Holden that is telling the story. If you only think about the Holden that the story is about then it's extremely depressing and the ending is a little unsatisfying.<br />The whole book he's basically trying to find somebody to listen to him and he's hardly ever successful. But when I think about the Holden writing the story I get hopeful. He's writing the book a year after the events in the story and the best part about this entire book is that he's finally getting what he's wanted throughout the whole novel and that's a person to listen to him and feel empathy for him. And that person is you, the reader. Once I realized this it made the book ten times better for me. In my opinion that's definitely the best part about this book.<br />The catcher in the Rye is a fantastic book and I think it deserves all of the attention it has received. It is truly an American classic and I don't think this book will ever lose its relevance to society. People will always be able to feel empathy for Holden and find him to be a relatable character. This is the type of book you can read time and time again and find more and more reasons to love it and discover J.D. Salinger's genius. This book is a masterpiece and because of it it deserves five stars.",2014-05-13

Even though it was slightly confusing due to all the paradoxical situations and characters, it was still a wonderful story. Even though the paradoxes were confusing at times, they also made the novel very intriguing. The plot to this story isn't very clear, so it's really based on the interpretations of the reader, which I think is really cool. I believe this book is based on coming of age. Kids, just like the main character Holden Caulfield, lose their way from time to time, then as they learn and grow older, realize what truly matters in their lives. This book really has me thinking about life and discovering its true meaning. Will my life be like Holden's? Will I, one rainy day finally realize where I'm supposed to be in life? I hope so.

I started reading some reviews and the common themes that kept popping up were &#34;coming of age&#34; and &#34;teenage angst.&#34;  So many of the reviewers talked about relating to Holden. I found Holden to be the single hardest to relate to character I have ever encountered in a work of fiction. With rare exceptions, Holden pretty much hates everything. It is troubling to me that people find this type of anger and bitterness so easy to relate to.

If I am curious to learn more about the mind of a teenager, I'll go read a psychology journal or watch a documentary, or take a class on adolescent psychology.  If I am reading a novel or watching a movie, I want to be entertained. I want to know what happens next.

US,45260721,R33J0IL7M2B3KI,0316769487,862964341,The Catcher in the Rye,Books,5,2,3,N,N,"The reason why this book is a classic","“Catcher in the Rye” is a classic and required reading in many schools. It not a classic because it is a simple tale of three days in the life of a sixteen year old adolescent struggling, as most adolescents do, with how they can and should relate to the world and their feelings that much that they see and hear is phony. Nor does is reveal why more than three disturbed individuals claimed that the book shows why they killed or tried to kill people – at best we can say that these sociopaths scanned the book superficially and supposed that it expressed their alienation from the world. Nor is the book significant because it describes J. D. Salinger's opinion about the world, his social criticisms, and why he, Salinger, secluded himself from the world. It is more than these things. The book is a classic because it is filled with symbols that can reveal insights: a careful reading discloses that everyone of Holden’s ranting, every event, and every person in the book has significant meaning.<br /><br />Salinger gave the book a strange title. Therefore it is important to note that Holden does not remember the correct wording of the poem “Gin (meaning, if or should) a body meet a body comin’ thro’ the rye.” He substitutes “catch” instead of “meet.” The poem, composed in 1782 by Robert Burns, was filled with sexual imagery. But Holden tells readers that he pictures children playing in a field of rye grain dangerously near a cliff, and he stands near the end of the field to “catch” them when they start to fall over the cliff.<br /><br />Holden may be seeing himself as a savior of young people like himself who are disillusioned with society. Yet, he doesn’t reveal how he will save them and he is unable to save himself from being disillusioned. Additionally, while he deletes the word “meet,” he is able to meet people and engage with them in a friendly fashion, but his meetings miss something important, and we need to decide what these items mean.<br /><br />The imagery of “catching” is emphasized by the repeated mention of Holden’s brother’s catcher’s mitt that is so important to Holden that he takes it with him to school. Again, Salinger wisely leaves it to his readers to think and decide the meaning of this mitt and its connection to Holden’s view of himself as a catching savior of children.<br /><br />Salinger also leaves it to readers to analyze what is bothering Holden, what is the significance  of each of his three day experiences, such as his inability to have sex, is this a metaphor and if so what is it saying? Why doesn’t Holden fight when he is hit twice in the novel? What does his red hat signify; is it important that the color red is the color of his dead brother’s hair, a brother he loved so much? Is Holden intelligent, why despite his ability to write compositions his teachers praised he does not want to study, why was he kicked out of several schools? Why does he react well with people even though he thinks they are phony What is his true views about religion even though he mocks it, what does his reactions to two nuns reveal about religion? Should we be appalled by his obscenities, why does he use them, what are the sophisticated ideas in his ramblings? What is  the significance of Holden's brothers and sister, his father and mother, his girlfriends Jane and Sally, the schools he attended and his teachers, and why is the novel set in New York, and why in the winter.<br /><br />Is he deteriorating into a mental breakdown, will he fully or partially recover from it; will he always be alienated from society? Salinger left this last significant point vague. Should we say that Salinger is suggesting that Holden could never become reconciled to society just as Salinger apparently never did and secluded himself? Why couldn’t Holden and Salinger adapt to society? What do all these and other things in the novel tell us about Holden, about Salinger, about people and society, and about ourselves?<br /><br />In short, this book is a classic because it has so much in it and causes readers to ask and seek answers to many questions. The Argentinean novelist Jorge Borges wrote that great literature contains obscurities and ambiguities so that two people can write the book, the writer and the reader. This is why “Catcher in the Rye” is a very good book.lassic because it has so much in it and causes readers to ask and seek answers to many questions.

He smokes cigarettes, gets oiled up on martinis, hits on broads in Greenwich Village bars and even pays a hooker for a throw. He's really kind of fiend that way. During his brief Christmas adventure in New York City, he pays his old English teacher Mr. Antolini a visit. Mr. Antolini tells him that he can very clearly see him dying nobly for some highly unworthy cause, but Holden is too tired to contemplate getting an education that fits his head and all. Holden doesn't want to be a phony lawyer like his dad because even if a lawyer defends the innocent, he may be doing it for phony reasons like getting accolades. He'd rather be a catcher in the rye.

To be honest, I didn't quite understand what all the fuss was about; as I saw it, Holden was a bit of a liar and, to me at the time, a showoff. I picked up this book at the local library sale a few years back with every intention of reading it the moment I returned home to see if I had been right at eighteen years, but, well, shiny new books grabbed my attention. I'm glad I finally had the chance to sit down and read The Catcher in the Rye again. It seems I missed a few things the first time around.    THE CHARACTERS  Meet Holden Caulfield, our esteemed narrator. To be honest, Holden isn't the most likable fellow: he stretches the truth right to the point of lying, but rarely beyond; he is overtly critical of others but blind to his own faults and he doesn't mind being sneaky. What I loved about Holden was his love for his younger sister Phoebe and his unerring honesty, something that juxtaposes with his own tendency to exaggerate quite a bit. And when I say honesty, I mean his honesty with his emotions. Holden doesn't try to pretend he is happy when he's not - this same kind of simplicity in emotions is reminiscent of a child.    The strangest thing about Holden for me was his envy of his siblings. His older brother has found his place in the world as a writer in Hollywood, and his younger sister, Phoebe, is enjoying her childhood. I don't think he quite wants what his brother has, but he envies what he sees as his brother's status. In Phoebe, he envies the simplicity and innocence of childhood. The momentous \\""catcher in the rye\\"" scene explains Holden's mindset: he wants the responsibility but still the youthfulness.    THE PLOT  On the surface, the plot is strangely simple: a young boy, kicked out of another preparatory school, goes back to New York to live in a hotel for a few days before returning home for winter break so his parents don't know he has been expelled again. Holden is trying to live it up: he tries to order Scotch and sodas (to his dismay, this rarely works), be a ladies' man (the scene in the Lavender Room is hilarious), and live on the wild side.    Under this layer, the themes run rampant. When Holden's brother Allie died, it changed Holden irrecoverably. For me, his memories of Allie and his yearning to return to childhood all tie into the effects of grief, especially upon a younger person. Although we don't know about most of the family beyond Phoebe, it seems that the rest of the family has moved on from Allie's death...all except Holden.    Holding onto the grief from Allie's death puts Holden in a unusual place, mentally and emotionally. Throughout the plot, his emotions and deep desires war with the thoughts in his mind, making for not only an interesting plot, but a quirky narration.    THE WRITING  Speaking of narration, meet one of literature's most unreliable narrators. I mentioned above that Holden has a tendency to exaggerate (greatly) and to lie (occasionally blatantly). He is the epitome of one of my favorite literary techniques - the unreliable narrator. Since Holden himself admits that he is \\""a madman\\"" and a liar, we can't take his narration of the story verbatim. The vast amount of exaggeration in the beginning pages made me start thinking about his authenticity, but once we really got into the plot, there was no doubt. Personally, I loved his own admission that everything might not be exactly how he relates it.    THE VERDICT  I forgot how intricate this book is, especially for so few pages. It was fascinating to read these particular themes from such an unreliable perspective. Salinger's work is a bit of a slog until you catch the rhythm, but once you do, it's hard to put Holden's story down.",2014-03-27

On the verge of adulthood, he stares wide-eyed at a world of impostors, fakers, and phonies, unable to speak their language or to understand anything they do. How can he join them? How can he resist? What hope is there in this world, when to become a man is to become an actor in a bad movie? He sees himself as good and bad, hot and cold, incapable of being a part of a society he loathes, yet feeling quite lonely in his exile. His brothers and sister are his only touchstones. His parents are non-entities. School is prison, and life is some maniacal thing, stretching out in front of him. An abyss. Holden claws and grasps to hold on to innocence, to truth, at least the familiar truth of childhood. Holden instinctively knows that part of him is dying. He knows that something is going to replace him. Something he despises. He must grow up. THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is the best example of TRUE teen angst in literature. The words, the symbols, the atmosphere of dread and despair, all point to a bewildered boy becoming a man. Some do just fine, while those like Holden find it far more difficult to accept, because they feel that in order to become an adult, they must deny reality and put on a mask. There are many like him.

Had never read it before so was interested in learning what all the hype was/is about.  The initial hype was, I think, due to the nature of the subject and the frequent use of profanity.  In the early 40's, when it was written, that was not the norm and people were shocked.  Now, it is used by some people to try to explain that there have always been such confused and upset young people and why they do what the do.  For example, the persons who shot John Lennon and Ronald Reagan said they had read this book and saw themselves in the main character, hence, we should understand why they did these despicable acts.<br /><br />People were raised differently in times passed.  We did have disturbed individuals but not to the extent that we have now.  Psychologists had not begun to tell people that they were not to blame for their feelings, thoughts or actions.  It was someone elses fault, ie. your mother did not understand you, youf father was not around enough as he was too busy working (to make a living, actually) and so on and so forth.<br /><br />Parents tended to side with the authority figures.  Teachers and policemen were looked up to and kids got in trouble if they did not follow the rules.  Now, teachers for example, have the parents of their students tell them how wrong they are and they their child is fine and should be catered to.  I know this first hand as one of our grown children is a teacher.  I NEVEr would have gotten away with some of the stuff his students get by with.

The problems I have with the story and the same ones I have always had. Author J.D. Salinger pretty much wrote about himself as Holden -- angry, terse, brilliant, cynical -- in order to separate Holden from a naive run of the mill man newly come of age in this soft, lying, backstabbing universe his parents and their generation created. As I watched Salinger live out his own life until his death a few years ago, he struck me as playing out Holden's days with all of those attitudes. And of course, he never published another novel, retreated to a little traveled town, and rarely came out to play. What is interesting is that he wrote some manuscripts to be published after his death, so hopefully we will get to see the rest of Holden's life unfold -- including, I understand, heaven.<br /><br />My final prayer is that, inasmuch as he has passed on,  I hope a copywriter has the good sense to trim Salinger's three- and four-page paragraphs.

I had often heard it referred to, especially in circles of child behavioral disability and learning disabilities, so having raised one of those boys, I thought I would take a peek.<br /><br />I think the argument in favor was that it was different for it's time. A &#34;coming of age&#34; story, and was resonated with due to the theme of teenage angst. Published in 1945, I can only imagine the uproar it caused due to the rawness of the material (tame by today's standards, so actually boring). If I consider the climate of 1945 and how teens were supposed to be behaving and perceived, this would have been one of those books that caused such a stink that people would buy it and read it just to see what the stink was about. Controversy sells. Sort of like The Last Temptation of Christ. Nothing makes me want to read or see something quite like people saying &#34;don't do it...it is horrible&#34;.<br /><br />I'm going to step into the character of Holden and tell you how he would tell you about this book:<br /><br />&#34;I can't believe all the goddamn phonies who say this is such a hot book and all, I really can't. I mean, what I mean is, it's just a book of random thoughts for chrissake. The entire book takes place in like 3 or 4 days of my lousy life after finding out I had been kicked out of yet one more fancy-pants school my parents wanted me to go to, and what I did during those days, and the junk I thought about. Seemed more like a million years that four or so days. It would depress the hell out of you if you read it, it really would, if you wanna know the truth. I don't see the goddamn point. Literary people are just a bunch of phonies who think something is good and tell people its good when it really isn't. They kill me, they really do.&#34;<br /><br />That's it to me! Those types of phrases are throughout the entire book. I've got no problem with swearing, but it was about every other sentence, so got monotonous. I could care less about the moral objections to the book. By today's standards, it's no big deal. A kid who gets access to alcohol, goes to bars, swears, drops out of school and contemplates hooking up with chicks. No big deal.<br /><br />Mostly, I was BORED. The book was not a compelling read. And I kept waiting for it to GO somewhere.<br /><br />From a mental health professional standpoint, I think all the buzz about Holden representing a kid with mental illness and or learning disabilities is a bit of a stretch. It could be ANY kid. He could go through those phases in his rebellion of finding himself as separate from his affluent background. On the other hand, I could clearly see the signs of extreme anxiety, mood swings, obsessive compulsive thought/behavior, and repeated school failure despite demonstrating high intelligence...so it could or it couldn't be indicative...worthy of seeing a counselor for sure. Seems like he was invisible to his parents unless he was in trouble.<br /><br />He was a sensitive guy who clearly loved his siblings, but had zero tolerance for what he perceived as &#34;phonies&#34; and an inordinately adept skill for seeing hipocracy everywhere. He had no ability to see the gray...all was black and white, good or bad, love or hate and he couldn't make up his mind which way he swung on any moment. He appeared to long to be understood, heard and assisted but all anyone could do was show him his failures, not assist him with a path he could be successful with. And there was HUMOR. I laughed a few times. There was raw honesty and I could see some of my feelings as a teen portrayed in him.<br /><br />So I guess I understand the potential value, but thought it was the most boring book on the planet...I really did...a godddam bore for chrissake...with a bunch of &#34;emperor's new clothes&#34; critics pushing it to stardom. I think also, the fact that J.D. Salinger stayed in seclusion and did not seek or want or welcome fame, made him a mysterious figure that people became interested in and his very avoidance of fame pushed him unwillingly toward it.<br /><br />I don't think it should be banned from schools, and I have no real problem with teens reading it (I don't think it seems a good idea for grade or Jr high schools), but I'm not sure where the real value of reading it is...is it assumed because of the questionable subject matter kids will want to read it and it is a way to get &#34;the medicine to go down&#34;? I guess with the right group, the very discussion of &#34;why in the world did this get to be a classic?&#34; is a good discussion place. So I have no moral objection, I just fail to see the value in it.<br /><br />It is a &#34;classic&#34; so I know there must be a lot of fans of it out there.  Tell me why you loved or hated it, or if you fall somewhere in between.  I'm glad I can say I read it, so I can be one of those phonies who at least knows what it's about rather than always wondering.  Yet I also feel like it is a few hours of my life lost that I'll never get back and could have spent on something better.nger stayed in seclusion and did not seek or want or welcome fame, made him a mysterious figure that people became interested in and his very avoidance of fame pushed him unwillingly toward it.<br /><br />I don't think it should be banned from schools, and I have no real problem with teens reading it (I don't think it seems a good idea for grade or Jr high schools), but I'm not sure where the real value of reading it is...is it assumed because of the questionable subject matter kids will want to read it and it is a way to get &#34;the medicine to go down&#34;?

This morphs into him internalizing the poem and recognizing that he thinks of being a savior of children unknowingly running through a field of Rye (Wheat) catching them (from death) as they nearly run off an unseen cliff. Whatever.<br />This story is written in 1940's speak. There are terms to look-up like Grippe and Flitty which are not used today. (I think they mean 'influenza' and 'perverse') Anyone Holden refers to is always prefaced with the title 'old.' There is lots of pointless swearing and smoking references. All of this gets tedious before the 4th chapter.<br />This is the story of an entitled immature wealthy tall teenage boy, kicked out of an east coast boys boarding school, just before Christmas. He would be due home on Wednesday but makes it home days early instead after a series of bar visits, cab rides, hotel stays, profuse smoking, alcohol abuse, impulse control issues, immature personality problems leading to one bad situation after another. He sits in judgement on about everyone he knows or has laid eyes upon, labeling most of humanity as being phony. He battles with substance abuse problems, a near complete lack of self confidence, an inability to form meaningful relationships, depression, emotionally labile personality, and probably an un-diagnosed case of bipolar disorder. The story reaches no climax, makes no point, only offers about a week long glimpse into the life of a messed-up teenager that is honestly not worth reading.

It is important to note that at the time of its publishing the intended audience of Catcher was a more adult audience, but it quickly became popular with teenagers.  The voice of J.D. Salinger’s Holden Caulfield captures much of the frustration and cynicism of teenagers and many students claim that Catcher in the Rye is one of the first books that they related to. Unfortunately this book is being banned in some schools, and students are being deprived of the opportunity to engage with this great piece of literature with an experienced teacher who can guide them through all that the book has to offer and place Holden’s words in context.<br />Critics of Catcher claim that the vulgar language and sexual references are justifications for not teaching the book to high school students, but one of the most important things to recognize with any book is not just what is being said, but why. What does what is said tell you about the narrator, and possibly, the author. Critical thinking is a skill globally recognized as integral to student success in not only school, but in a diverse, global world. The way that Holden speaks is, whether we like it or not, similar to how many young adults speak. Not reading Catcher will not change this, but by reading and discussing why Holden uses that language, how he uses cursing to hide deeper feelings or sexual innuendo to discuss things he is uncomfortable with thinking about, students may come to reflect on how they use language and why.<br /> One of the reasons why Catcher was at one point the most banned and most taught books in U.S. high schools is that it forces students, teachers, and even parents to have these difficult conversations. But it is through recognizing the teenage identity, why Catcher resonates so much with students, staring it the face, that we can make progress on helping teens think about themselves and the world more positively. Yet if this book were not so strikingly real, it could not comment on the “phonies” without being hypocritical and thus, ineffective. Students can spot a prepackaged moral in literature a mile away, and it turns many of them off from learning that lesson because they feel as if they are being talked at instead of talked to. But Catcher in the Rye speaks to students from a teenage level which appeals to many students. The novel makes many students feel that they are not alone in how they look at the world, and this could not be accomplished without the book reflecting our world, with both its flaws and capacity for love.<br />SPOILER below!<br />As we come to find out at the end of the novel, the “phoniness” of society and the stress of expectation as a teenager push Holden to his mental limits. No matter how you feel about specific passages in this book, no one wants their child or loved one to feel alone or become depressed and overwhelmed by their world. When we are able to acknowledge that Holden’s while exact story or language use may not be our own, but studying the Catcher in the Rye serves as a gateway to great, generative conversations with our youth about how to address the complex issues of teenage life we will come to see that Catcher in the Rye is an essential high school text not because of the words on the page, but how those words can generate greater awareness and self-knowledge in teens.

I was influenced to read it again following a recent documentary of J.D. Salinger on PBS.  The Catcher in the Rye reminds me some of Huck Finn.  Both books were narrated by two American youngsters who called things as they saw them.  However, Huck was fighting for his life and for personal freedom, Old Holden was fighting personal madness and inner demons.  Perhaps manic-depression, I don't know for sure.  The thing that I liked most about \\""Catcher\\"" is that it is a tale being told by a young 16-17 yr old who has already gone thru the nervous breakdown and angst that he has survived and described in the book.  As the book ends he is getting the help he needed.  Perhaps he will get his demons under control.  Holden advised his sister that if he could have any job he wanted it would be to watch over playing children, he'd be a catcher in the rye.  He would make sure children at play did not fall off a nearby cliff adjacent to a rye field.  Perhaps Holden could someday translate his love and concern for children by getting a job as a teacher or something?  (Perhaps that book is coming from the writings left behind by the deceased Salinger?)  I also believe that Holden Caulfield is J.D. Salinger.  There are so many examples of personal facts that are shared by Holden and Salinger.  One example is that old Sally Hayes is Oono O'Neill.  When I first read the book at age 20 or so I could not relate to Holden.  I saw a whining 16 yr old prep school city boy from a well-to-do NYC family who griped about everyone and everything.  Why care about him and I did not. Today I cut Holden some slack.  The book was published in 1951 and I think it still works today.  Good writing and descriptions.  211 pages of excellent prose.  It took a 3rd reading for me to appreciate the book.  PS: Old J.D. Salinger was a different kind of guy.  As an adult he was infatuated with teenagers and young girls.  Hung out with them.

It was 1962 and I lived in a provincial city  not far from London. I can't remember whether it was set reading or merely advisory, but our teacher spoke highly of it and there was certainly classroom discussion about it. (Interestingly, nothing at all was said about the bad language, slang or the sex. I think I borrowed it from the school library.) What I recall strongly was my complete incredulity at the mode of life of the hero. Here is a guy who (aged 16!!) is leaping in and out of Manhattan cabs and inviting the drivers to have a 'cocktail' with him; flitting in and out of uptown hotels, visiting nightclubs, calling up girls for a 'date' (we didn't have a phone & nor did any girl I knew) and ordering up a tart for a short time. I was amazed, especially as I understood this was a hero who was supposed to be speaking for youths such as me. I had never even been in a cab, let alone by myself; I knew vaguely what a cocktail was but of course had never had one; etc. Frankly, I couldn't understand what species of being Holden was or what the hell he had to do with my life - I found his 'angst' (as we later learned to say) incomprehensible. Now 'Saturday Night and Sunday Morning' - there was a hero I could understand in a place I recognised!

Once I read it the first time from the library, I decided it was one that needed a spot on my bookshelf. Definitely a book on my favorites list, and it will probably remain there because it is so timeless.<br /><br />I don’t think this will be a book review so much as a recommendation. READ THIS BOOK.<br /><br />First, I’ll give you a little history. It was written in 1951 and continued throughout the years to earn a spot on the most banned book lists. Not only is it one of the most challenged books, it also made a place for itself as one of the most read books in schools due to its themes that are so prevalent in adolescents.<br /><br />The Catcher in the Rye is a novel about a cynical teenager who has been kicked out of boarding school yet again and decides to skip out on his last few days and spend them in New York City. Holden, the main character, is just a normal teenage boy who goes on adventures in underground New York. The reader sees the world through Holden’s eyes and feels the impact of each event he goes through. The reader really gets to be inside of his head. It isn’t a book about action and suspense; it’s a book about alienation and the emotions that rage through every teenager.<br /><br />The book doesn’t focus on what happens to Holden. It focuses on how he takes the events. Sometimes, people get sad for no reason. Sometimes, you feel lonely and just need to talk to somebody. These themes speak to adolescents and adults everywhere because they are still true today. People have always and probably will always have thoughts of alienation and doubts and wondering if they belong. It’s human natures, and J.D. Salinger weaves these issues flawlessly into a brilliant book filled with humor.<br /><br />I love this book. I have little pieces of paper stuck into the pages where there are passages I reread over and over again. Some of them are just hilarious, andsome of them just ring the truth. All the phrases Holden uses amuse me also. For instance, he says things like “I got a bang out of that” and “that killed me.” Everything about this novel feels so real and so contemporary. I especially love reading it out loud (minus all the cursing) because you can practically hear someone saying those exact words. It has a unique conversationalist writing style.<br /><br />READ READ READ THIS BOOK!! Trust me, you won’t regret it. Don’t let the age turn you off from it. I procrastinated reading it for a while because I figured it would be a grueling classic with proper language and a difficult plot to follow. Instead, I got one of my favorite books ever.

It is Salinger’s writing style that makes this book a literary masterpiece. The way that Salinger puts the reader in the mind of a sixteen year old kid, Holden Caulfield, to grow up and mature with him is amazing.  The problem with the story however, is the nature of Holden, his whining really starts to get on your nerves.  The reader is overjoyed when Stradlater punches him in the face, and that is not very far into the book.  From a literary standpoint, Holden is a good character. He is somebody that readers can relate to a little, someone that they can aspire to be or not to be.  Holden is a character that everyone is or has been.  Holden leaves no questions unanswered because you are Holden.  That is what makes it a literary masterpiece, but that is also the book’s downfall.

Holden's narration, with its mixture of insecurity, belligerence and alienation, all delivered in a totally realistic yet unique blend of slang, cadence and verbal stylings, grips the reader from beginning to end. It's like listening to a fascinating character going on and on about his life in incredibly vivid language. You don't want him to ever stop.<br /><br />This is a fairly rare gift. I can't think of too many books in which it is simply the language of the first person narrator, rather than the story, that is so fascinating that you just want him/her to keep going. Humbert Humbert in Lolita is one of the rare examples. Raymond Chandler's Phillip Marlowe is another.<br /><br />Anyway, Catcher's author, JD Salinger, had already demonstrated a flair for constructing narratives built around his facility for realistic yet gripping dialogue in a series of short stories published in various magazines over the decade previous to Catcher's publication. An excellent example is the story \\""Pretty Mouth and Green My Eyes,\\"" published coincidentally in the New Yorker almost at the exact same time Catcher was hitting bookstore shelves. Prominent earlier examples include \\""Uncle Wiggly in Connecticut\\"" and the acclaimed \\""A Perfect Day for Bananafish.\\"" Each of these stories shows Salinger revealing character almost exclusively through dialogue and Catcher is his attempt to extend that approach to novel length and revealing a character strictly through his own words over an extended narrative. Done and done brilliantly!<br /><br />The best comparison I can make to this ability of Salinger's is Ernest Hemingway, whose own early short stories showed the same kind of facility at building drama through dialogue. It was something he also used to great effect in early novels like The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms, but he then petered out (the utterly embarrassing Across the River and Through the Trees, published about a year before Catcher, shows just how far he descended).<br /><br />Salinger, of course, didn't share the same fate as Hemingway because he more or less stopped writing (or at least publishing) with a few exceptions (Franny and Zooey, etc.) after the success of Catcher. That's a damn shame but all the better reason to savor what he did produce, especially The Catcher in the Rye.",2014-01-03

This fictional novel that takes place in the 1950’s is quite relatable for any teenager. The book deeply describes the thoughts of one teenage boy, Holden Caulfield, and his struggles with growing up.  The theme that the world is full of phony individuals is conveyed throughout this coming of age novel.<br />Holden Caulfield is a troubled rich boy living in a world full of people whom he does not understand. He goes from one prep school to the next, never receiving his parents acceptance. With a pessimistic view of the world, Holden takes a journey in order to find himself. A person of any age is able to take a trip into the mind of an American teenager by reading the Catcher in the Rye. The text is full of slang from the point of view of a pubescent boy.<br />Although the book was well thought out and I agreed with many of the writing strategies, one thing that I did not understand was the introduction of the character Jane. Jane serves as Holden’s special girl and love interest. Despite the fact that Holden mentions Jane throughout the book, the girl is never physically presented in the story. Readers want to know what happened to this girl that is always on Holden’s mind.<br />The book appealed to me on an emotional level. I could relate to many of the things that the boy in the story was going through and thinking. Holden overthinks many things that go on in the world. Each person he meets is highly judged. Admitting it is hard to do, but everyone judges others, and teenagers especially. The book makes it clear that there are people in the world that are genuinely good people with a huge mind and heart, and that there are also people in this world that are simply what they appear to be, fake and phony. The book constantly focuses on this theme.<br />I am not a big reader. I read when I have to. I must admit that this is one of the few books that I enjoyed greatly. After picking this book up, it was hard to set it back down. I read it in any free time that I was availed. It was nice to get a glimpse of what life may have been like in the 50’s and take a trip into a teenager’s mind of that time. From the book I came to the realization that teenagers of all generations are quite similar.

If a reader is unable to get over this point, and the book was first published in 1951 with sections from earlier years, then it is unlikely that they will be capable of appreciating the main thread of the entire work. Salinger has written from the perspective of a young man, beset by many troubles, who is unable to come to terms with his own life, with society, with the education system which, he seems to feel, has failed him in many ways. It is, from the main character's point of view, a very one-sided, lamenting tale filled with worries, with missed expectations, with mental anguish and hopelessness.<br /><br />It is a work which is still very relevant in our times, if the reader is able to understand everything that has been packed into the text.<br /><br />We are confronted with a young man who has failed in college and faces the prospect of returning to his home, his family, with little hope for the future. He has failed before, and we gain the impression very quickly that he knows he will fail again. He has no real interest in society, in the world around him, but has an inner vision of what he wishes to do, where he wishes to be, but not how he can achieve it.<br /><br />He is a young man lost in memories of better times, of possibilities, of grand ideas. His mind constantly wanders, digressions within the story as he recalls people and places, events which have impressed him, mainly from his childhood and formative years. He is comfortable around younger children and avoids, with few exceptions, conversation with his peers who are, to his way of thinking, boring, shallow or arrogant. We gain the impression that he hates much of society, or the society he has been forced to grow up in, to spend his college years with, and would love to return to an ideal which, perhaps, has never existed.<br /><br />We follow the wandering thoughts and memories of a man on the brink, overwhelmed by events he cannot understand, surrounded by people who cannot help him, by people who see the chance of taking advantage of his problems for their own ends. We see a man who other people do not want to understand, who cannot see that he has mental problems and that he is completely out of his depth in society. And it makes no difference whether the language used is from the Forties or from our own times: the story is as fresh today as it was over fifty years ago.<br /><br />That The Catcher in the Rye is one of the most banned books in the United States is understandable: it has been objected to, removed from bookshelves by those who cannot read beyond the words on a page, who cannot see the anguish, the pain, the complete lack of hope a young man feels. People who cannot understand that a seemingly normal young man from a good family, attending a good college, can have problems far beyond those they have experienced themselves. It is a work well worth reading just to delve into the mind of someone faced with insurmountable mental problems, with depression, with hyper-activity who cannot keep his ideas running along one straight track but has to digress, explore, worry and justify.<br /><br />The more astute reader will understand long before the final passages exactly what this character is talking about as he relates his life and memories, but the closing lines are still an eye-opener, and a warning to society. In modern times it could almost be suggested that this man is one who is working towards a complete breakdown which, with the right tools, could cost the lives of countless others through an act of violent hopelessness.wandering thoughts and memories of a man on the brink, overwhelmed by events he cannot understand, surrounded by people who cannot help him, by people who see the chance of taking advantage of his problems for their own ends.

Every since I was younger, I heard about this book but never had the opportunity or interest in reading it. At the age 30, I picked this book up and was motivated to read it with an open mind. After reading it, I did not understand why this book is so treasured and revered by so many. My honest take on this book is that the main character was a spoiled, privileged immature child who hated everyone and everything. He was self-centered, negative, and did not really have any redeeming qualities. It was not a coming of age story as some have said because I don't believe his attitude or behavior changed or adjusted throughout the story. Much of his story telling and references appeared as gibberish and I felt at times it had no relevance to what was actually occurring in the book. I guess I just couldn't connect or relate to the main character or the story line. I don't see how relevant it is in today's day and age. Teenagers will always have rebellion and could be self-centered, however, I don’t think all could relate to those that have the opportunity to go to private/boarding schools or the many privileges that the main character had. It also bothered me on how negative his attitude was towards everyone and everything. It today’s verbiage, Holden is a “hater”.

It was one of the first \\""adult\\"" books that I had read; a peek into what might await me when I left my safe suburban cocoon. Among other matters that I recall, I realized at the time that although Caulfield was only one year older that I chronologically, he was light years ahead... which could perhaps be quantified as five years... in terms of life experiences, as well as attitude towards authority, and adults in general. Just to be able to rent a hotel room... and in New York City of all places... on one's own was unfathomable, not to mention being able to go into a bar and order a drink. Of course a big reason for that was my lack of money, still scraping by delivering newspapers and mowing lawns, something our \\""guest workers\\"" do today. But intertwined with that was the lack of \\""attitude\\"" to pull it off. So, over 50 years later, decided to give it a re-read, to see if I or the book aged better over time.<br /><br />This is J.D. Salinger's most famous work; it was first published in 1951, when he was 31. On the re-read, I was immediately struck by the almost pitch-perfect ear for the slang dialogue of the time. Salinger tells the story as though it were written by a very \\""hip\\"" 16-year old. For example, in referencing someone much younger than I today, Caulfield says: \\""You take somebody old as hell, like old Spencer, and they can get a big bang out of buying a blanket.\\""<br /><br />Caulfield has just been expelled from Pencey boarding school, and will not be returning for the winter term. It is not for lack of intelligence, he just can't see the point of his classes, a theme that has been repeated endlessly through the ages, certainly by, at the time, Paul Goodman, and captured in a lyric from a Simon and Garfunkel song: \\""...When I look back on all the crap I learned in high school, It's a wonder I can think at all...\\"" The \\""trap\\"" of that attitude is to descend into mindless \\""nihilism,\\"" or become a cult follower of some ideology, or just someone else with \\""the answer.\\""<br /><br />For Caulfield, most everyone is a \\""phony,\\"" from his fellow students to his teachers and Headmasters, and Salinger does work in some telling examples. On the first read, and perhaps even today, I'm still more willing to accept people at face-value. Not so Caulfield, who more properly saw through facades, and understood the underlying motives of people. After being expelled, and yes, with some money, before going home to \\""face the music\\"" with dear old dad, involving his latest failure, he is on \\""the lam\\"" in NYC for a few days, and that is the core of the novel. Of course women are involved... the ones of his own age that he has been \\""hustling,\\"" and the others, of the bars, and even a \\""professional.\\"" There are the details involving the young women of school, for example Jane Gallagher who \\""...keeps all her kings in the back row...\\"" (referring to checkers, and maybe a bit more). And there is the simply dealing with adults, be they cab drivers, doormen, or bartenders. In terms of the dialogue of the time, and I certainly do not recall this, homosexuals were referred to as \\""flits.\\""<br /><br />Based on the almost 3,500 reviews at Amazon (with over 350 being 1-stars), the novel is still read today, all too often in that \\""dreaded category\\"" of being a school assignment. Many of the 1-stars are simply because it was a \\""school assignment,\\"" but some of the more thoughtful ones involve the fact that Caulfield is not a very likeable character: spoiled, irrational and irresponsible. All too true, but I've never considered this a reason to \\""rap\\"" a book. The real question should be: Is the portrait of an unlikable character authentic?  And I think Salinger hits on all cylinders using this criteria.

It's a book that, for some reason, has been extremely important to loners & social misfits such as the man who murdered John Lennon. It is what you'd call a Cult Classic in juvenile literature.<br /><br />Holden Caulfield is clearly a very disturbed young man who feels like he doesn't belong to the real world. Even if Holden could create a world of his own, he still wouldn't be happy. Holden is sincere and wants to be loved by others, but his personality is too flawed for him to accomplish this task. He feels sorry for himself & lives in a world that is detached from reality. The harder he tries, the more disappointed he becomes until he finally ends up as a patient at a TB hospital.

Although many argue that this novel is boring and contains virtually no plot, I think when read thoroughly it can teach teenagers a lot. Most importantly, that they are not alone in what they are feeling. The struggle of dealing with being torn between growing up and staying a kid is something that every teen goes through, and this book weighs out the pros and cons of both sides. Salinger also managed to find a way to relate to almost every type of teenager - Caulfield is the perfect example of a mixture of many high school stereotypes, making this book comforting to many. Not only this, but Salinger also created a setting that can still be related to more than sixty years later. Even though many years have passed since this novel was published, Salinger wrote in a way that managed to capture unchanging human characteristics much more than the constantly changing surroundings. Salinger uses a myriad of tricks to keep teens interested in his book - witty humor, talk of sex and alcohol, and a general \\""you're not better than me\\"" attitude from Caulfield directed at his elders. However, high school students are not the only people who could benefit from reading this book. While most adults will probably at first view Caulfield's character as a typical disrespectful teenager, The Catcher in the Rye provides glimpses inside his head that show he may not intentionally be causing harm. I think Salinger hoped to show adults what is really going on in the mind of teenagers when they talk back and act irrationally, that many are just going through their own problems and aren't sure of any reasonable solutions. For example, the death of Caulfield's brother and his flunking out of school numerous times had a serious effect on his sanity and caused him to act how he did. Overall, I think everyone should give this book a chance. If you don't like it the first time, take a break, channelyour inner teenage angst, and try again.",2013-11-02

This book will always be an all time favorite for me for a myriad of reasons, it contains so many unique aspects that continue to draw me back in to reading it time after time. One of the main reasons I enjoy reading this book is for my long love of New York City.As Caulfield ventures through the concrete jungle in search for his true self Salinger does a damn well job of describing the ins and outs of what its like to stroll down the sidewalk with no idea where to go next. Being a New York City native for the early years of my life (0-7), if I'm ever searching for a nostalgic feeling of the adolescent years of my life I know I can always give this book a read. Another reason I find myself always coming back to this book is, I find Salinger's colloquial direct address to the reader style of writing almost relaxing in some sort of way. When Holden presents a direct address to the reader I cant help but feel the need to generate my own opinion on what hes contemplating over. I have a weakness for books that present the thoughts of the main character as they progress along the storyline because I feel as if I'm reading the characters personal journal as oppose to wondering what the characters thinking at all times and have to generate my own thoughts for them, if that makes sense? All in all some may say that The Catcher in The Rye is just a poorly written plotless story about some degenerate who wastes his days wandering the congested city streets hiding from life but I completely disagree I believe that the novel is the the most unique book written in the 20th century, with its exclusive style of writing and on the ball feel of what its like to be in the city.",2013-11-01

It deals with real world issues and the alienation of the a 16 year old kid..<br />Despite being written in 1951 It has many topics  teenagers would be able to relate too. It is a modern classic of the coming of building romans . I find the main character, 16-year-old Holden Caulfield, very intriguing and as I read the book, it was fascinating to get inside the head of the strange, rebellious teenager.<br />The book begins with Holden directly addressing the reader, and he begins to retell the events over a three day period from last December. His story starts at Pencey Prep, a prestigious boarding school filled with \\""phonies\\"", as Holden likes to call them.<br />What I find the to be the most interesting part is how from the beginning of the book where  Holden is  being characterized as insolent, lazy and , completely clueless about his future and what to do in the present.<br />Almost all of the story is one long flashback of this three day escapade  with the occasional references to the present. One thing that sets The Catcher in the Rye apart from other similar novels, is the fairly frequent use of profanity. There is not a page in the book where there is not at least one highly profane sentence uttered by young Holden. This is effective in making the reader relate to the characters better and make the characters seem realistic, but on the other hand, if you're under fourteen, I would certainly not recommend the novel to you! It isn't only the language used that makes The Catcher in the Rye unsuitable for younger readers, but also the sexual innuendos that are through out the whole book. This also adds to the development of the holden showing that he is still a teenage boy at heart  and has the sexual desire. The ever present theme of not wanting to grow up is what drives Holden to madness by the end of the story.<br />J.D. Salinger's novel is a wake-up call to all teenagers and in a sense, is an inspiring read because it sends out the message that we should all remain hopeful and true to ourselves. Teenagers can relate to it because of its complex themes of rebellion, identity and independence but I would recommend you read it before you're an adult otherwise you may have the urge to slap Holden for his actions when reading the book!",2013-10-31

Perhaps had I read this when I was younger it would have affected me more, but now, as I try to find or create a connection, I'm just left... Well.  I'm just left.<br /><br />It was Mr. Antolini's note to Holden that finally grabbed my attention.<br />\\""It is the mark of an immature man that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while it is the mark of a mature man that he wants to live humbly for one.\\""<br /><br />I was told I was too immature recently, and it just killed me.  \\""Boy, it really did.\\""<br />I tried to figure it out and tried to understand how I gave that off.  Without truly knowing what I was doing, I think I realized that I had given up on the option of living humbly (or living at all) for any cause at all long ago.  Whether it be something, someone, or just myself.  At some point I was finally able to see something in front of me and felt like I understood what it was to live for something.  Not just, as I've often thought in the past, to be the catcher in the rye for anyone who strayed too close to the edge but to be the catcher for a specific reason... and to equally allow the possibility that I also, at times, might need a catcher myself.  I wish I had the gift of speech and introspection such that I could have so succinctly put my thoughts, feelings, and actions into words.<br /><br />This epiphany... or at least the motivation for it... evaporated quite quickly, and I, missing the point, fell back into searching for something for which I could nobly die.<br /><br />To see Holden cry for and over his little sister for whom he obviously held a great respect and had the utmost love, come to the conclusion that he should not tell anyone anything was quite rather depressing.  I waver, but is it worse to live in fear of missing someone and, therefore, remain isolated or is it worse to allow yourself to catch and be caught and, inevitably, miss those who caught you and are now gone?  Did he \\""really like\\"" people who were dead precisely because the only thing left to do was miss them?

Even today it resonates as a testament to teenage rebellion. It sells very well every year or so I read and this is because of its ongoing relevance with younger people. J. D. Salinger was a quite complex man and he has recently been newsworthy as some stories which he wrote but would never have published are now to see the light of day. Salinger was in his early thirties at the time of writing and had just gone through WW2 and he captures the mood of the immediate post war period with his first person narrative style as Holden grapples with his identity, his belonging, connecting and his alienation from the older generation. I have read &#34;Catcher in the Rye&#34; as a younger person and now later in life and find it a challenging but rewarding book. It is disjointed and episodic and Holden is a bit of a whiny character but he crystalises a period in time which was unique in its circumstances, but very recognisable in its humanness.<br />Worth the effort.",2013-09-24

Usually it's just there for dramatic effect. \\""You'll never forget this story, this story will haunt you for life....,etc\\"", but this one actually has proven true. I read this months ago and now that I'm adding the reviews to the blog from Goodreads and my mental reservoir, I have to say that this book truly has never left me. I think of it at least once every two weeks. I have no idea why really, but I think there's such a total genuineness about it that it really gets inside you.<br /><br />The book isn't perfect because of the bizarre writing style, which would turn some off. I know some don't even keep going. You should push through any awkward growing pains, though, as it did prove to be so rewarding.  The main character of Holden Caulfield is hard to get into at first, since he initially seems to be a smart-alek, dirty-mouthed, negative kid who doesn't care about much. It becomes clear after awhile he's troubled, lonely, compassionate, and actually a sweetheart.<br /><br />You end up feeling for him, caring about what happens, and trying to figure out how he can turn himself around, or if he even wants to and has reason enough to try. He is certainly not the typical character to read about, and this type of character is another reason I feel reading fiction encourages the growth of empathy in people so much.<br /><br />The scene that really stands out to me is the sadness of the hotel room scenario between Holden, the girl, and her pimp. How tragic and I felt for him as his youth really came through.<br /><br />It's a completely character-orientated novel. There's a strange opening to the book where not much is going on, and little ever happens action-wise. It's mainly an introverted thinking novel. You don't get the sense that the boy is troubled until a few chapters in, other than he's failing out of school. I would have liked a longer ending also, to see his parents reactions and more details of what happened next.<br /><br />Overall this is a worthy classic - I felt for the character and thought it held interesting insight. Language is pretty graphic so some parents may not want their kids reading it if too young. There's no sex or anything violent, although their are several adult implications. For the life of me I can't understand some of the blame from criminals on this book - the person is troubled, fragile, and lonely, but they are not violent, twisted, or evil.<br /><br />I rated this four stars after I read it because of some of the overly long paragraphs and ramblings got a bit much sometimes, and I would have enjoyed a little more action and thought editing slightly would have helped. However, if I rated it now from memory alone would have went for the big 5-star label.

That's about all there was for a macro-plot, and there wasn't a whole lot of micro-tension in the individual scenes either.<br /><br />2) Characters (4 stars) - Holden Caulfield is the bright but immature lead.  He sees things, \\""phony\\"" things, in the world around him, but doesn't know how to react to them or to the emotions they generate within him.  He's a fun guy to go on a midnight search for adventure with; especially after he reveals little bits about his past which provide clues as to why he acts in the way he acts.  The other characters were very minor, but all felt real as Holden bounced into them and moved on.<br /><br />3) Theme (3 stars) - The main character obviously doesn't like the \\""phoniness\\"" of the world around him.  But neither he nor the author really explores the nature of phoniness.  The other theme was around not fitting into society, and what your choices are when that happens.  This theme was explored in a little more detail, but still no answer or deep perspective was offered.<br /><br />4) Voice (4 stars) - The tale was told as a stream of conscious narrative from the main character.  And Salinger does a marvelous job of using idioms, repetitions, and tangential thoughts to create an unusual mood and perspective.<br /><br />5) Setting (4 stars) - The story takes place in New York City, and I certainly felt transported to the taxi cabs, bars, and everyday strangers you meet.  But also the story takes place in Holden's head--in his emotions, wandering thoughts, and spontaneous bursts of responses--and when I put the book down, something magical happened: I started viewing the world as if I was still in Holden's head.<br /><br />6) Overall (4 stars) - The book doesn't have much of a plot.  But if you can get through that, and just sort of let the prose settle you into the head of the main character, I think it's a ride worth taking.  Holden's not amazingly wise or kind or anything, but he is very unusual, and for that I'd recommend the book.",2013-09-12

We either glorify Holden Caulfield as a teen sounding the anthem of rebellion for generations of our youth or we vilify his disregard for normalcy along with his x-rated coming of age and attempt to shield our children from the stark reality of the real world.  65 million copies in print yet it still holds records as the most censored text in American history. It's an enigma.  I will not attempt to understand the irony of such numbers or dissect what many believe to be the perfect novel, alongside one or two others, Huckleberry Finn and Gatsby of particular note.  Legions of academics have come before and attempted to pull forth the inner meaning of the scenes in his dorm, the stories of his friends and family, in particular the death of his brother and relationship with his younger sister.  Even more poignant would be the potential deflowering of Jane Gallagher, the girl next door, which seems perilously close to the first published incidence of date rape, for which Caulfield gets a bloody mouth trying to rise in her defense, but for which J.D. Salinger, never takes the opportunity to investigate fully.  What a missed opportunity for what would surely be a fantastic prescience of a modern scourge.<br /><br />Beyond Salinger's description of what it might like to be \\""Down and Out in Paris and London\\"", ala Orwell, we never quite arrive.  When Kerouac paints the seedy underbelly of America in, \\""On the Road\\"" Caulfield can't quite go those places, after all he's only 16.  And beyond \\""Gatsby\\"", F. Scott's descent into alcoholism, in \\""the Beautiful and the Damned\\"", we don't see much change from being on the streets in New York a generation later.

That doesn't happen much, though.\\""<br /><br />This quotation summarizes my feelings after finishing Jerome D. Salinger's popular American classic The Catcher in the Rye. It is the story of 17-year old Holden Caulfield, the protagonist and first-person narrator of this novel. Holden is a teenager who finds himself somewhere in between childhood and adulthood and therefore suffers from depression and mental illness. Because of his personal issues, he performs poorly and repeatedly flunks out of school. Salinger managed to create a protagonist to which every reader can somehow relate their own transition to adulthood including all its highs and lows.<br /><br />At the beginning of the novel, Holden is expelled from Pencey prep school. He travels to New York earlier than planned to spend some time there before his parents find out about his expulsion. He spends some time in the Big Apple in various bars and other places to clear his mind from the people at his school. Throughout the story, he reveals how much he hates phony (superficial) people - a term that he applies to almost all adults mentioned in the novel - and the movies, which, according to Holden, are the phoniest of all. As the story progresses, Holden reveals more details about his personal state of mind.<br />Holden describes his experience in a funny way with a good sense of humor. On the one hand, he observes society around him very maturely, but on the other hand he still finds himself in the position of a child who wants to run away and start a new life somewhere else. Although he swears, smokes and drinks all the time, Holden is a likeable character because many things he tells the reader are a valid criticism of society.<br /><br />Although many of Salinger's slang terms and references appear a little odd to readers in the 21st century, the main theme of the book still relates to the issues of our contemporary society, which have not changed in about 60 years. Depression, suicidal thoughts and a lack of self-esteem among young adults are as widespread today as at the time of the first publication in 1951. Salinger was ahead of his time when he addressed these issues at a time they were still considered taboos. It is therefore not surprising that the book was at that time banned in many American schools. Nevertheless, The Catcher in the Rye is an outstanding piece of literature that everyone should read.",2013-06-25

Salinger, is a great example of 20th Century American literature. In the novel, Salinger tells the story of a troubled seventeen your old boy, Holden Caufield.  The writing is an excellent example of American literature from that period.  The sentences are short and direct.  Despite the uncomplicated writing, Salinger gives a detailed, in depth account of Caufield as the boy struggles in school and in life in general.<br /><br />Salinger makes you feel like you are inside Holden Caufield's head, with his simple yet rich and descriptive sentences. Salinger makes sure that you know every detail about Holden's life.  For example, when he describes Holden's hat: \\""It was this red hunting hat, with one of those very, very long peaks.\\""  That sentence is typical of the simple yet descriptive writing in the book.<br /><br />Salinger tells Holden's story by illustrating past experiences in Holden's life.  Salinger describes these experiences through the thoughts about those experiences in Caulfield's head.  The reader always knows what Caufield is thinking.  That style makes the reader feel as if he is part of the dialogue.  By putting the reader inside Caufield's head, Salinger is able to describe Caufield's struggles from Caufield's point of view. For example, when Caufield is in New York and is anxious about his date with Sally, an old friend, Salinger writes: \\""I didn't feel much like going.  I'd made that damn date with Sally, though.\\""  By using this style, the reader feels Caufield's anxiety and indecision.<br /><br />Catcher In The Rye is a must read. No matter how many times you read it, you will always be intrigued by the rich, simple and descriptive sentences.  It is the best novel that I have ever read.

He has plenty of charms. He likes to pull your leg all the time. The more you get to know him the more you realize he doesn't have his stuff together and probably never will. Holden Caulfield in J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye is only 16, but you can imagine in a few years he'll be jumping from job to job because he just couldn't grow up. This novel is required reading in most high school curricula, and I think the reason for that is to serve as a warning to teenagers preparing to move into the next phase of their life: know the difference between healthy and unhealthy values.<br /><br />At the start of the story, we learn that Holden Caulfield has been kicked out of Pencey Prep because he failed most of his classes. Holden makes all kinds of excuses. The one that seems to stick is that the whole place is full of phonies. In Holden Caulfield's world there are phonies everywhere. And the mere existence of these so-called phonies is enough to drive Holden to indifference. He grows annoyed when his history teacher, who seems to care about Holden, begins lecturing him about making an effort in life. Holden makes an excuse and gets out of there. In fact, to avoid further humiliation he leaves Pencey that very night, though he still has four days left before the end of the term.<br /><br />The novel seems made up of random occurrences, what with a run-in with a prostitute and her pimp, visits to bars and clubs, meetings with various friends, but these things happen at the whim of Holden Caulfield. He makes a decision, often unwisely, and then these things happen. Holden does things without purpose. Even the decision to invite the prostitute to his hotel room was not well thought out since he had no intention of sleeping with her. Much of the novel finds him wandering around aimlessly, as though he can't decide what to do, where to go.<br /><br />His paralysis in making a healthy decision for himself seems to lie in a hypersensitive sense of injustice. Even the tiniest injustice is enough to paralyze him with indecision and inaction. The fact that the world is full of phonies is enough to convince him not to pursue any meaningful activity. He has an ideal of himself as a savior of sorts, but the way he envisions this is as a fantasy rather than a realistic goal. He describes his ideal future as a person who catches lost children as they wander towards the edge of a cliff. Humanity needs him, he seems to believe, to protect them from the error of their ways. But this vision only serves to highlight his inability to make a concrete decision about the direction he wants to take his life.

The only people who think this is a classic are rich trouser stains who complain about the silver spoon being too lumpy.

Manners dictate that I should address you as \\""Mr. Caulfield\\"" since I don't know you personally.  But after reading your absorbing account about your experiences since you got expelled from Pencey Preparatory School in \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" (CITR from now on), I feel as if I know you like an acquaintance, if not a friend. Besides, calling you \\""Mr. Caulfield\\"" sounds so stuffy and formal.  Well, anyway, whether you like it or not, I'm calling you Holden.<br /><br />Believe me, I'm not the first person to comment that you are quite a complex and contradictory individual.  You can be both witty and blunt, cynical and naïve, tenderly caring and harshly intolerant.  I'm also not the first person to comment that you can be what you accuse practically the whole world of being - deceptive, insincere, hypocritical, and yeah, your favorite word - phony.  Maybe it's a self-defense mechanism on your part against all the other phonies that upset you.  Maybe you're sarcastically trying to wake others up to the fact that you're not fooled by them and trying to make them see the foolish errors of their behavior. Whatever.<br /><br />Holden, you, I, the entire world can often be phony and dishonest.  Why?  I think it's because we are all afraid, afraid of being ignored, being hurt, being alone, or of something else.  I'm not excusing it, just trying to understand it as part of the imperfect human condition, and even forgiving it when I can.  You might want to try to do the same.  It's not easy, but it might make you feel better.  Also, consider this: I heard somewhere that if people were always truthful and open with each other, they would eventually destroy each other.  I think that's quite possibly true.<br /><br />No, you don't exactly have a \\""David Copperfield\\"" existence, or any other Dickens novel existence.  In fact, you seem to come from a family of high-class prestige and accomplishment which a lot of us would envy.  A corporate lawyer dad, a Hollywood writer older brother, a grandmother who gives you cash four times a year. But, it seems to me that it's a source of shame for you, instead.  Did your \\""phony\\"" outlook start with how you think about your family?  I got that impression from CITR, especially your description about how you first met Jane Gallagher indirectly through your mom getting upset that Jane's mother's Doberman Pinscher pooped on your lawn. Oh, and later how your mom chewed out your little sister Phoebe when she took the blame for you for smoking while you were hiding in the closet.  Yeah, your Mom sounds neurotic and snobby.  Is your Dad like that, too?  Is he more fond of being a big shot than in saving innocent lives in court? Anyway, it sounds like your family is at least a little concerned with keeping up appearances.  I can understand somebody rebelling against that and wanting to find out what's real and really good about life.<br /><br />However, Holden, \\""good\\"" does not necessarily mean perfect.  Nobody's perfect.  Yet, time and again, it seems you're looking for the perfect person, you think you find that perfect person, then that person does something that disappoints you, and you cynically reject that person.  Take Jane Gallager again, for instance.  I guess you liked her because she wasn't pretentious and overly competitive, even with checkers.  But then when you found out that your ex-Pencey roommate Stradlater had a date with her in a car, you lost it and tried to fight him.  Did you think Jane was tainted from now on?  Is that why you never followed through on calling her?  Yeah, being noble and unblemished and protective and uncompromising is all well and good, but you can take it too far.  James Castle did.  Yeah, I guess it's admirable, in principle, to kill yourself rather than be forced to take back something you believe is true.  But it's really stupid, too.  You can stick to your guns and still stay alive.<br /><br />Oh, I almost forgot, you also throw over a wise, concerned friend and mentor Mr. Antolini just because he touched your head???  Is HE a tainted bad guy from now on?  Come on now, Holden.  He's given you lots of sensible advice about continuing your education and increasing your knowledge and discovering what ideas are right for your head so that when you find ideas to make the world better, you can express them more eloquently and more humbly.  That William Stekel quote: \\""The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause , while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.\\""  Great quote.  Remember that quote.  Don't try to be Christ or Hamlet.  Show others what you believe in by example, by the life you lead.  I gotta keep remembering that myself.<br /><br />It's nice that you believe in truth and decency, and being true to yourself (at least most of the time).  Your \\""Catcher in the Rye\\"" wish in protecting and caring about innocent youth is also praiseworthy  But you can't practice those beliefs by playing Peter Pan or preventing change or shielding people from the big, bad world.  Your late, beloved younger brother Allie showed that to you.  Your younger sister Phoebe is still showing you that, by challenging to find things you like and believe in, and growing up and finding new interests, and even by being willing to follow you wherever you go.  About that.  I know you're desperate about changing your life, and not just bitching about it.  But hitchhiking out west and living alone in a cabin and pumping gas?  Holden, you can do better than that!<br /><br />I suggest you grit your teeth and complete that final year of prep school.  By then, you'll be eighteen and a legal adult (and able to drink your scotch and soda legally) and free to determine your own destiny.  Then, decide what occupation would best help achieve your \\""Catcher in the Rye\\"" goal.  Perhaps you would like to be a kindergarten teacher or child counselor/tutor.  Or a museum guide.  Or a writer of children's books (without having to \\""sell out\\"" to Hollywood, \\""mecca\\"" of phonies, like, ahem, D.B.).  You know you're no moron, in spite of what you say.  Use your fine English skills to achieve your dream (by the way, I would have liked to read that composition you wrote for Stradlater about Allie's baseball glove covered with poems.  Sounds like a good tribute.  Too bad you threw it away.  Yeah, Stradlater is an ignorant peasant.).<br /><br />Holden, I'm no psychoanalyst - you're dealing with at least one already.  I'm not pretending I have all the answers.  I don't - nobody does.  I also don't want anything from you, and I am not being paid to write this.  Again, I guess I am being a little like Mr. Antolini by not wanting you to ride for a \\""terrible, terrible fall\\"".  I suppose I empathize with you and the social, sexual, and occupational challenges and frustrations you face.  I'm certainly not alone in this.  Will you listen to my advice?

The book has been banned at various times and in various places. There has been more recent acceptance of the book, but the work still arouses passionate debate. Holden Caulfield is the anti-hero in the story. He has a lot of character flaws. He has trouble accepting the phoniness of adult institutions. He longs to find an identity and feels increasingly alienated from mainstream society.<br /><br />Holden was kicked out of a fancy prep school. This was a pattern for him. The setting was the few days between when he was ousted to when he returned to his boyhood home. Salinger's use of inner dialogue was masterful. One could see the unique perspective of the troubled teen.<br /><br />Holden was very interested in sex. He was a virgin, but knowledgeable in the ways of vice. He was a drinker and smoker. He knew about various types of perversity. Herein is the major controversy of the book. Caulfield is profane and can curse like a sailor. He discusses homosexuality, prostitution, and pedophilia at various points. These were especially taboo topics in the straight-laced 1950's.<br /><br />The story was detailed, sometimes too much so. The inner dialogue was a bit boring in spots. Although there were tedious sections, the majority of the book was interesting. Holden was a desperate teen who was trying to recover from disappointments, immature blunders, and a loss of faith in authority figures. Holden did have good traits. He was very loving and committed to his little sister Phoebe. In the end, Holden did not run away because he loved her and had no realistic plan of survival on his own.<br /><br />This was a valuable book in that it showed the inner conflicts common in adolescence. There is a desire to fit in and a desire to gain independence. Holden desires to find his way as an authentic person. He is most disturbed by the phoniness present in society. If one can get beyond the many crude and vulgar references, he or she can glean a lot of valuable insights about human nature and the angst of youth.many crude and vulgar references, he or she can glean a lot of valuable insights about human nature and the angst of youth.",2013-05-15

In the times that I would put down the book, it was because I got sick of him and just didn't wanna continue for the night and had to wait for motivation to read it another time.

Because somethings get difficult or people who he dislikes are brought up into his everyday life, he just gets lazy and stops trying. It's hard to grasp why Holden does what he does. We all know a person just like him. I could name a couple right off the top of my head. He always has the urge to lie. He lies when he can. Calling Holden a compulsive liar would be spot on.

I was embarassed giving it to my daughter, but luckily we had other gifts for her, so no big deal.<br />And what is with all those 5 stars reviews for this book?

To me, I was told to read these books and later the teacher or the professor would lecture and have active discussions in detail of the nuances and literal and figurative interpretations on the intentions of the author and the real plot of what the author was trying to convey to the reader.<br /> The better students would learn the triggers of success and mimic their instructor's persuasions and add \\""a little\\"" of how the novel affected them in their young lives.  But my take on many of these classics actually confused me and being the rebellious student that I was I usually didn't go with the program and in many instances took my rebellion in the force of protest and usually ended up with an old-fashioned hook a C.  I did the same thing when I first read \\""Catcher in the Rye\\"" in fact being very much like Holden Caulfield in my studies of this novel.<br /> The fact remains that as one grows older one gains from life experiences and is able to appreciate life on a wider and more knowledgeable scale.  I have spent most of my academic life reading and writing of history and life memoirs of things that have actually happened.  My studies were based on things that have happened.  However I find myself being brought back to the classics and with that added maturity, I have found out that I do indeed understand them better.<br /> J. D. Salinger was really writing of his youth when he wrote this book.

Simple and loving!<br /> The book is written in the first person by Holden Caulfield and it tells of his relationships with his classmates, teachers and his parents.

In fact it does represent the brain of a person who has not fully developed. To tell you the truth this writing in the vernacular of a teenager, represents the brilliance of Salinger's writing.  Some youth can adapt to the adult world and move on; others like Holden have a very hard time in doing so.<br /> My review intent is not to give away the meaning and plot of this classic book but to rather engage the reader to see that this book is indeed of deep meaning in which I never recognized 46 years ago.

Salinger's `The Catcher in the Rye' is a book that I would not recommend to anyone who enjoys books with reasoning and clarity. `The Catcher in the Rye' is about a sixteen-year-old boy named Holden Caulfield who leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania to go stay underground for three days in New York City. The book explains what takes place within the three days in New York City. But while reading the book, I often found myself confused. Salinger did not do a job with making sure the reader knew who was talking. This book consists of underground, children, adult and Holden's voices. It is hard to describe what kind of character Holden, the main character, is, and I found that quite disturbing. If it is one character that every reader should have sense of, rather they agree with the character as a whole or not, it should be the main character. Once I reached the end of the book, I struggled with discovering the purpose of Salinger's story. While reading, several questions popped into my head pertaining to different descriptions and situations and not many of those questions were answered.

Even if the review would end up being a one to three star out of a five star rating. And for some reason, I decided to start with The Catcher in the Rye.<br /><br />Now, being from Bahrain and at the same time home-schooled, I wasn't able to read this in school like the rest of the world. And the only time I heard about this book was from spoken references on TV and in Movies. And as one who reads a lot, I don't feel like a genuine reader without reading the ultimate classics of the 20th Century. So, I begun with The Catcher in the Rye.<br /><br />Now, let's start with how the book began. We meet Holden narrating that he would be telling us a story about a certain event rather than his entire life like David Copperfield and others of that sort. I actually felt really draw to the book because of the beginning. But slowly, the narration and the dialogue began to annoy me. Holden does admit that he may be a little bit more stupid and childish than normal teens but honestly, Holden just went over the top with his immaturity. He would fake an injury just to get into a conversation with random people on the street or in a subway.<br /><br />Throughout the book, all we read is how Holden lies his way through a few days in his life. And it's not the kind of lying that will get you to high places and actually accomplish something with. It's the useless kind that is done because you're bored and you need something to do. Likewise, Holden is reckless, impulsive, and a compulsive liar but he is sincere in his own way. When he speaks about his siblings, you know his love for them is true and honest just by the way he describes them.<br /><br />The terminology and dialogue is very different and sometimes, I had to stop and think about what Holden really means. They're using slang we don't use anymore and it's not the 'radical' kind its the, 'I don't know it too hot (too much)' kind. What irritated me the most was the repetition in some dialogue. For example, a conversation between Holden's so-called-girlfriend speaks and Holden: \\""Look, I have to know. Are you or aren't you coming over to help me trim the tree... I have to know\\"" And more of this type of repetition goes on and on in the book.<br /><br />To be utterly honest, I expected the book to be all about Holden's out of the world experience. Only to have it about his thoughts and experiences within a couple of days or so. I guess, the greatest journeys do happen the shortest of times. I enjoyed the book and found it captivating in its own irritating way. And I will always remember my favorite parts, the conversations he had with Cab Drivers and the little time he spent with his sister, Phoebe.<br /><br />Overall, I liked this book a lot more than I expected. The writing style, dialogue, storyline (or lack of it), and characters hold their own uniqueness that we can't find in books now-a-days. And I can't help but admire that about classics like 'The Catcher in the Rye'.ot (too much)' kind. What irritated me the most was the repetition in some dialogue.

It was passed amongst my classmates underneath school desks because the book was not considered \\""polite\\"" or particularly worthwhile. The book was not banned. Yet, it was not approved of either. I read it because everyone else was reading it. To be honest, the impression I got at the time was that my peers read it because of the language (which was considered scandalous) and the comments concerning sex. I never had anyone to tell me they read the book because they felt any connection to the character of Holden Caulfield. I was disappointed with the book. The language embarrassed me. I did not use language like that. I did not know anyone who used language like that.<br /><br />Decades passed before I read the book again. A preacher in the neighborhood, at the time, asked if he could borrow the book. Silly me let him have it. I never saw the book again. A month ago I got another copy of it and reread it. My experience of reading the book was entirely different now that I am an old man. I feel I better understand what is happening with Holden than I ever did when I was Holden's age and read the book.<br /><br />The book ends with Holden in a psychiatric institution. He is not sure what his attitude towards his life will be when he gets out. But, it's what leads up to that point that allows the reader to better understand Holden. I have to say that the voice Salinger created for Holden Caulfield is one of the most precise and vivid voices I've ever encountered in literature. At first I thought of the voice as being extremely stylized. After a while, however, I began to see how the voice was created around a certain state of mind in order to reflect what was going on inside Holden's head. The language mirrors the psychological condition Holden succumbs to.<br /><br />Once he relates the story of his brother Allie, I began to see through the screen of confusion Holden erects around himself in order to keep people at a distance. The sorrow and anger and confusion his brother's death gives him are emotions Holden struggles to process. As best he tries to make sense of what has happened, he is not equipped to deal with the harsher, more senseless aspects of life. As a result, he fights against his life in ways that try to make sense for him. But, at sixteen years of age, it is beyond his abilities. Sadly, he goes through the novel acting in self-destructive ways that increases rather than decreases his despair. By story's end, Holden has reached that place where he can no longer go it alone. It is time for others to rescue him from his isolation, sorrow and pain.<br /><br />The Catcher in the Rye is a book of immense insight and compassion. Using a voice that is so perfect in pitch, Salinger creates a character that, like Willy Loman, demands attention. I am so glad I reread this book. I did not know if I would find anything in the novel to speak to me as an old man. But, there is much of humanity here that transcends the age barrier.

For example, Holden says that school is \\""full of phonies, and all you do is study so that you can learn enough to be smart enough to be able to buy a goddam Cadillac some day, and you have to keep making believe you give a damn if the football team loses...and everybody sticks together in these dirty goddam cliques\\"" (Salinger 131). For many students this is an accurate picture of high school; a place where no one cares, everyone is fake, and the world is divided into cliques dictated by a popularity ladder. For students who resist this structure, or find themselves constantly tangled in the web that is high school, they may find a kindred spirit in Holden; a character who fights boldly, bravely, and perhaps uselessly against conformity. Additionally, this text gives teachers a chance to talk about such literary elements as symbolism (Holden's hunting hat has the potential to produce a very interesting discussion), narrative voice (can we trust a character who is unbelievably hypocritical, constantly refers to himself as \\""crazy,\\"" and lies to nearly everyone?), word choice (what exactly is going onwith that title anyway?), and/or theme (love, lies, innocence, honesty, authenticity: take your pick folks!).<br /><br />An added benefit to this text is that it is written in very simple language, although the layered meaning is quite complex. However, even though the language is simple, as educators we must be very careful about which students we attempt to teach this text to. Due to the prolific profanity (see above quote for a simple example), and often mature content, I would not recommend teaching this book to any students below 9th grade. It might be wise to consider if your class is ready for this mature text, and to examine whether or not the content (and this character) might offend/bore/alienate some or all of the students in your class. As part of this consideration, I would also recommend that teachers send a packet home with their students explaining to parents why this book should be taught, how it fits into the overall unit of study, and how the teacher plans to scaffold the trickier elements of this text (such as the profanity). Despite these challenges I still believe that this text should continue to be taught. \\""Classic\\"" or not, there are elements of this text that can resonate with adolescent readers, and this book presents many interesting opportunities to engage with literary terms and ideas that we want young readers and writers to grapple with.",2013-02-05

Over two hundred pages, the book covers the four days trip that the main character, Holden Caulfield, took after his private school expelled him for failing his classes except English, as he keeps reminding certain persons offended by his umpteenth expulsion. For years this book got the reputation of being an offensive novel with a lot of curse words, a rebellious teenager, and the unfortunate reputation of being, to Mark David Chapman's twisted mind, an inspiration in murdering the rock star John Lennon. Due to this reputation, readers' expectations have always been disproportionate to what \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" is all about. To me, I think the book is not really a story, but in fact a rich and complex portrait of a teenager in crisis who narrates/describes his disgust toward phonies, his school, his New York trip but also his personal family life, in which a certain event, that happened a couple of years ago, gave birth to Holden's problems with his family.<br /><br />In its plot, the book's prose revolves constantly around Holden Caulfield and his voice stands out as an imposing one that doesn't leave the reader as he shuts the book. Very realistic and plausible, the novel shows very beautiful scenes that occur around Holden's trip, but also fascinating disgressions as he describes certain objects and friends that he got to interact with. As such, the novel is an excellent way to encourage other readers to dive into Salinger's other books, which have inspired incidents mentioned in this book and offer other experiences involving Holden Caulfield and his family. Though none of Salinger's other stories confirm what happened to Holden after the novel's ending, those stories offer various interpretations and discussions as to the main character's life.<br /><br />However I wish that Salinger had taken the time to develop other scenes that he briefly described, such as Holden's return to his house and to his parents. Not only that, though I didn't get myself caught up by all the hype and controversy surrounding the book, which people talk about as if it's Clockwork Orange, I  can say that I liked the book, but didn't get obsessed by it as much as I thought it would be. Maybe because the novel constantly revolved around Holden's perspective, or maybe because the book rarely dove into scenes that could have given very powerful reactions between the characters and Holden, I don't know.<br /><br />I don't know if I will reread the novel one day.

Indeed, I read it in one sitting.  Like Mark Twain, Salinger tells his tale from the ironic perspective of an adolescent narrator (Holden Caufield), whose voice Salinger captures with complete authenticity.  The book is laugh-out-loud funny, far funnier than Huckleberry Finn (though this may be more a function of the modern reader's ability to relate to humor that is 50 rather than 150 years old).<br /><br />Salinger writes with economy of words and has a striking ability to get the reader emotionally involved in his story and characters.  This book is particularly moving because we can all relate to the adolescent alienation of Holden.  More importantly, we don't really have a good response to Holden's criticism of the phoniness of adult life and adult conformity.  The criticisms are all true, of course, but we somehow find it necessary to make do as adults.  Holden's melancholy about the passing of his youth and desire to savor and to save the purity of children (by acting as the \\""catcher in the rye\\"" who keeps them from running off the cliffs of thier childhood) is very moving.  The characters in the book are vivid and unforgettable, and one especially loves Holden's young sister, Phoebe.<br /><br />The rebelliousness of Holden is what I found most attractive about the book when I first read it for school years ago.  But the sadness and humor of the book are what strike me most now.<br /><br />I'm not sure why this book gets only 4 stars.

Salinger published this reputed American classic in 1951, which was probably the most censored book in high schools and libraries until the mid 1980s. I'm not sure why it's considered a classic other than the fact that professors and publishers like looking for hidden meanings in each chapter. I'm not saying that I didn't like the novel, because I did enjoy it, but mainly because I think Salinger's descriptions and language usage of the late 1940s was terrific. I forgot about the word \\""crumby\\""- meaning inadequate, or \\""phony\\""- meaning pretentious. The narrator and protagonist of the novel, Holden Caulfield ( a seventeen year old boy ) uses these words a lot in his narration. And how about \\""flitty\\"", or referring to people as \\""old\\"" this or that? The writing in this novel is very strong, but the story is moderate at best to this reviewer. I don't see myself debating hidden meanings with anybody. I'm assuming it was censored in schools because of sexual allusions, the morality codes of the 1940s and 50s, family values and some coarse language ( very mild compared to today's language). The thing that puzzles me is the title of the book! Holden is walking through N.Y.C. and hears a little boy singing a song to himself. What's up with the title of the book? Shmoop states: \\""What's up indeed. The first mention we get of this mysterious catcher in this mysterious rye is when Holden overhears a little kid singing, \\""If a body catch a body coming through the rye.\\"" Momentarily, it makes him feel not so depressed, in part because Holden is a fan of little children, and the only things better than little children are little children who are singing.\\"" Apparently, Holden sees himself as the catcher in the rye catching the children as they fall off a cliff as he construed Robert Burns's 1796 poem. Who knows? Salinger was a kind of recluse and didn't give many interviews.<br /><br />The book starts off with Holden Caulfield ( our protagonist ) in a hospital in Southern California narrating the story of his previous December's adventures in Pennsylvania and N.Y.C. The reader doesn't know whether it's a mental or physical hospital. Maybe that is one of the debatable points of this book. Anyway, he is being expelled from Pencey Prep in Pennsylvania. The reader gets the feeling that this isn't the first school that he's been thrown out of. He doesn't seem to see why learning is important, doesn't get along with his teachers, or roommates, and doesn't seem to respect his very successful parents. And what does his `red hunting hat' symbolize? He heads to N.Y.C. several days before his parents will receive the letter from Pencey Prep saying that he has been expelled. In N.Y.C., he books a cheap hotel and pines about his life. He likes to drink, smoke and make an ass of himself. He contacts previous girlfriend Sally, and makes a mess of things. He constantly thinks about calling another old flame Jane, but never does. He contacts his sister Phoebe, and an old teacher Mr. Antolini. The crux of the story is what happens on his adventures in N.Y.C, and the big debate with literary scrappers is : What's up with his mental health, and what does his movements mean? As far as this reader is concerned- who cares, just read and enjoy!<br /><br />I wonder after reading this book if this Holden Caulfield character is really J.D. Salinger as a young man. I had the same feeling when reading John Irving's 'In One Person'. Anyway, you literary debaters, I think if you re-read page 170 you will find out how Holden Caulfield really feels about school and life: \\""You ought to go to a boy's school sometime. Try it sometime,\\"" I said. \\""It's full of phonies, and all you do is study so that you can learn enough to be smart enough to be able to buy a goddam Cadillac some day, and you have to keep making believe you give a damn if the football team loses, and all you do is talk about girls and liquor and sex all day, and everybody sticks together in these dirty little goddamcliques\\"".

US,27529508,RFXJUAXRVLVWU,0316769177,862964341,The Catcher in the Rye,Books,2,2,3,N,N,"book, not story","I am a senior in high school and I was assigned the Catcher in the Rye for my English class. The whole theme of this book is growing up. At seventeen, there are a lot of things that Holden is going through that I can relate to. He is very indecisive and has no idea what he wants from his life yet. The diction that Salinger uses to tell the story in Holden's words really exemplifies his youth. `Lousy' and `phony' are childlike words, while the overuse of profanities shows the main character becoming a bit more adult. Holden feels the need to be independent and not have to rely on the adults in his life, especially those who have let him down, like his parents and teachers.  He sees most adults as `phony' and doesn't really trust the world of growing up.  I find this a little ironic because, in his search for independence, Holden is growing up, and becoming even more like the people he despises. Holden has amazing perception, and he sees the world for what it is, full of people who act fake and are very corrupted. He tells his sister Phoebe about wanting to be the `catcher in the rye' instead of any normal career because he wants to save innocent children like the boy singing in the street and his sister, his only real source of happiness, from the terrible adult world by catching them before they fall off the cliff that surrounds the field of rye that represents childlike innocence.  Holden's view of the world and bitter tone gives the readers a very different perspective than what is normal, and probably a more accurate view on the turmoil many teenagers feel growing up. However, despite how much Holden takes in, he is very blind to the problems he has. He is very quick to criticize everyone around him, and mark people as fake or perverted. Holden is incredibly judgmental, and is probably the most `phony' character in the whole book. For example, at the beginning of the novel when Holden is still at Pencey, he goes, uninvited, into the boy named Ackley's room to getaway from his own roommate, Stradlater. Holden despises being around Ackley and can never seem to get away from him, but yet uses Ackley when he needs him, not because he is a friend. Holden's two-faced quality can be seen throughout the novel. He continually uses the people he doesn't like for his enjoyment, like the older women in the bar, Sally, the taxi drivers, and Luce. This is a testament to how little Holden sees about himself. He is more lonely than anything, but doesn't realize it because he is too busy examining the faults of others. Holden's whole existence in the novel is hypocritical and contradictory. He constantly pretends to be an adult, yet he doesn't trust adults and thinks they are fake. He tries to be the ladies' man like Stradlater, but he did nothing but complain about his roommate. His whole story about why he was in New York early and his expulsion form Pencey was a complete lie, but he points out how everyone else lies.  I think that Holden really does have the potential to be a good person as seen with his interactions with the nuns at the station and with his little sister; however, throughout the novel, Holden is egotistical, phony, and incredibly selfish.<br />  I didn't like this book for two reasons: it had a very unlikable protagonist, and it had no story. I believe a book should have the readers rooting for the protagonist through his struggles, and I'm sorry, but I find it difficult to be on Holden's side because of the fact that he won't solve his own problems before he criticizes others. A book also needs to actually have an interesting plot, and I feel this story didn't even have a plot. I spent the whole novel wondering what the point of the book was. I couldn't identify any rising action or climax and I feel like the story had no structure. The reader follows Holden through New York with the intention of doing...what? The story was aimless and uninteresting. If a book leaves the reader not even caring what happens next, it doesn't really serve the purpose of a story. I think it is a great analysis of growing up, but poorly written as a story.",2012-12-23

The novel is a good one, it hooks me from the very first sentence and I wish it can go on as long as War and Peace and the Bible combined.  It begins with Holden telling us about his lousy life, he just got kicked out of Pencey, a prep school, because he flunked a bunch of courses, but not English.  Thank God!!!  Naturally, he thinks the world is populated by a bunch of phonies and idiots and perverts and naturally, they are all grown-ups; like D.B., his brother, a screenwriter in Hollywood who drives fancy car and all, or his teacher, Mr. Antolini, who's sensitive as hell and I sort of liked him at the beginning until he tries to molest Holden.  Personally, I'm quite interested in what kind of parents Holden has and why they produced such a lousy kid in the first place but Holden doesn't tell us much, except that they are touchy, and probably pretty sore about him not taking his education seriously.  Kids are okay with Holden, though, like Phoebe, his ten-year-old sister.  She's an obsessive writer of some girl detective novel and she wants to run away with him all the time, so do we.  As we follow Holden, okay, being dragged around all over New York City by Mr. Salinger's strange but extremely wonderful prose, we encounter and get terrific laugh out of many amusing scenes and characters.  But then, when we reach the end of the novel, we realize that Holden is not some lousy rich kid who flunked out of prep school.  He's the sadness in all of us, the loss of our innocence, the ephemeral of life, the death of people and things we hold most dear to our heart, the catcher in the rye that we all wish to be...

It's all been said over and over again. I do, though, want to mention an experience I had with the book over time.    When I first discovered the book at 16, I was completely devoted to the Holden mind-set. Everyone I saw was dripping with the fake and the phony. The world looked different to me. This almost ruined books for me. I actually expected to get that experience from every book I read. It was sad when it was not true. When I reread the book at about 25, it still rang true, but with some of my own angst long-gone, the book had lost its urgency. In a moment of personal confusion and conflict, I reread it yet again at about 30, hoping it would renew me in some way. It had the opposite effect. I couldn't help but think that Holden whined way too much. Enough already.    I read it again at 42. And? I realized, perhaps more now than at 16, that Holden was more right than ever.

It's about a teenage boy named Holden who has problems with society and people. He gets out early on the break when he got suspended and goes out on a trip to New York and kind of goes on a quest for himself and how he views the world and people. This book may be not be suitable for some as he can be unlikable, he talks about that you have to greet warmly to people so that you can be liked or else and seems to like to talk to girls than to go deal with boys.

The book is a flashback to the life of a sixteen year old boy and the different encounters that make him who he is.  The boy's name is Holden Caulfield.  The beginning of the book anchors you immediately with Holden's opinion of the world around him.  Holden is currently at an all boys boarding school on the east coast.  He is failing the majority of his classes though and is being kicked out.  The book begins in Holden's last days at boarding school, then takes you straight into his adventures.  The setting of this book is more dangerous than the world I know.  It's thrilling to see how many interesting characters are introduced throughout the book.  Each is vividly described along with Holden's unique opinion on each.  Holden gets across his point in a humorous way.  This book is amusing because of how bluntly Holden expresses his thoughts.  While at a boarding school, a boy named Ackley lives in the room across from Holden's.  While in Holden's room, Ackley states that he's going back to his own room, Holden replies, \\""Okay,\\"" then thinks, \\""He never exactly broke your heart when he went back to his own room.\\""<br /> This novel is written in first person which makes it easier to understand the way Holden thinks.  This novel puts you in his shoes.  The descriptions allow you to picture every detail.  For example, while checking into the Edmont Hotel, Holden describes his surroundings, \\""The bellboy that showed me to the room was this very old guy around sixty-five.  He was even more depressing than the room was.  He was one of those bald guys that comb all their hair over from the side to cover up the baldness.  I'd rather be bald than do that.\\""  Everyone and everything is analyzed by Holden.  His thoughts are often sarcastic.  Holden's life is full of exciting, new experiences that keep me turning the pages.  In fact, I enjoyed the book to the point where I did not want to finish because I did not want the book to end.  Holden thinks, \\""What really knocks me out is a book that when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it.\\""  This novel is wonderfully entertaining, sarcastic, and amusing.",2012-10-23

Yeah, I was definitely wrong.<br /><br />Holden is a teenage boy who has just been kicked out of his school for failing most of his classes.  As the term has not quite let out for winter yet, he is still on campus, but after an altercation decides to leave and explore the big bad streets of New York by himself.  Here he gets himself into mild trouble, almost sleeps with a prostitute, and generally just gambles around talking to himself and attempts to keep himself entertained.  This is all done while expressing a genuine dissatisfaction at the world around him.<br /><br />Holden is not an endearing character.  Sure he has his moments when it comes to little glimmers of helpfulness and appreciation in him, but for the most part he's just not that likable.  And I really think that was the intention.  He is not your general hero and instead portrays a depressed, ego-centric, angst-ridden teenager.  Which is probably immediately identifiable to a big portion of the population.  Especially those who are his age as well.  There are other characters in the novel as well but we only see them through Holden's eyes.  Therefore, if he likes them they are described in glowing terms, like his sister, or if he doesn't like them he makes sure you know it, like his roommate at the school.  But in the end, when it comes to Holden himself, I really didn't care what happened either way to him.<br /><br />There wasn't a normal plot to this book.  It kind of just rambled on like Holden's stream of consciousness without a break.  I actually found it kind of hard to read as I'm not fond of the stream of consciousness type of writing.  It works ok in the movies when a person is actually talking, but in writing it doesn't translate as well or lend itself to being readable.  That being said it was a rather tragic book and a good look at how people can feel lost at times.  But I won't say I enjoyed it.  I actually found the book pretty average.  Maybe not worth the hype it's been given, but not anything I'd say I'd hate either.  At most I'll probably remember it for a few days and move on as it didn't spark anything in me.<br /><br />I can't see myself reading anything else by Salinger.

Mr. Salinger, through his young protagonist Holden Caulfield, keeps you on your toes....happy, sad, anxious, and wondering what's true and what's acting.  (Holden Caufield loved pretending he was acting the part of some obscure character in a movie staring his favourite actors).<br /><br />Of great import to young Holden is his deep love for his little sister, Phoebe; his dislike for anything or anyone pretentious or phony; his respect for his brother, D.B.; and an ever gnawing  undercurrent and profound sadness at the loss of his brother Allie, who died of lukemia a few years earlier. He misses his brother desperately, and continues to talk to him as though he is walking next to him.  He disliked school...(all of them from which he had been expelled) though some of his favourite friendships had been developed there.  Sometimes young Holden's  thoughts are jumbled....sometimes they are clear and profound.  He finds his questions....i.e., \\""where do the birds go when the lagoon is frozen\\"",  annoying to others,  and this is confusing to him as he thinks  all kinds of questions should be important to everyone and thus deserve  an answer.<br /><br />Sadness  for me as a reader comes when young Holden is disillusioned by those who had  been his mentors.  I felt particularly protective of the protagonist when he was in the company of  Mr. Antolini.  Young Holden Caufield seemed  to attract more than his share of \\""perverts\\"".<br /><br />No matter how many times you have read this book, you will continue to enjoy it.

I mean, it's not a phony book. I hate phonies. They turn my stomach. I like to curl up in a chair with a good book. Why are people always saying that, I mean, what are we, cats? Have you ever seen anyone curl up in a chair or anywhere else? I gotta tell you I never have. I really haven't.<br />This book, by J.D. Salinger, he captured exactly what I was thinking, it was kind of uncanny the way he did it. That's another thing I hate, the use of the word uncanny, I mean phonies use it all the time like it's some big deal. They really do.<br />The best thing you can do is to read this book. It really is. It is the kind of book that you might not even like at first, sizing me up as a whiney little punk who could use a slap or two in the face to get me with the program. But the more you read, the more actual sympathy you feel towards me, or at least understanding of some kind, what I've gone through, I mean. Where I am coming from in terms of how life is affecting me at my young age. And you see that I am quite tenderhearted after all. I really am. I end up feeling sorry for people, and I help them whenever I can. There is even a scene where I kind of get suckered into hiring a prostitute, it just kinda happens, and when it comes right down to it, I find what we are about to do actually degrading, and I no longer want to go through with it.<br />I recommend this book highly.

Like East of Eden, Ordinary People, The Outsiders and Rebel Without a Cause, The Catcher in the Rye authentically portrays the struggles of teenage boys in a certain place and time. The quality of the writing is exceptional. While first-person point of view can be a challenge for young readers, the authenticity of the narrator's voice and the book's compactness make it more accessible. A lot happens in four days trapped inside Holden's head.<br /><br />The Catcher in the Rye can be seen as a young adult novel or an adult novel about the teenager within us all, a lament on the necessary loss of innocence on the way to adulthood. You can't read it as an adult without getting personality insights than were impossible as a teen because teens are by definition living within the transitional state exemplified in Holden. They can't see it as transitional because it's the only reality they know, the fog they are living within.<br /><br />Caterpillar, pupa and butterfly are different states of being. The vast majority of teens are emerging from pupae-ville, just starting to sample the sights and smells of the world. For them, death--James Castle's mangled body--is an abstract notion, something in a video or book or some stage or screen rendition of Romeo and Juliet. The average teen has never been in the presence of a lifeless body and smelled death's pungent vapors--well, maybe a frog in biology class--let alone lost a beloved sibling.<br /><br />Only an adult can look back on their teenage years with perspective, yet academia keeps throwing The Catcher in the Rye at teenagers because of what it says about the challenges of growing up.<br /><br />The Catcher in the Rye depicts an upper-middle-class male in an urban setting going through a crisis. He's overwhelmed by the pressures of becoming an adult, but too much has been thrown at him at once. He hasn't gotten over the death of his beloved younger brother, Allie, when he witnesses the suicide of a dormitory mate, James Castle. He's been traumatized and can't function. How much can a guy take?<br /><br />He's looking for answers and can't seem to get them, like Conrad Jarret in Ordinary People and Jim Stark in Rebel Without a Cause. All three boys struggled with the death of people they cared about.<br /><br />And the one person Holden respects and looks to for help, Mr. Antolini, he mistakes for a pervert, a threat. It's too much; so Holden withdraws. He wants to go live in a cabin in the woods, which is a metaphor for &#34;Time-out! I need a break!&#34; Phoebe rescues him with unconditional love. She accepts him no matter what. If she'd been a brat,the message would have been entirely different.<br /><br />Holden goes from being antagonistic and callous to highly empathetic. He wants to protect children from the brutal realities of adulthood. But the trip has been too exhausting and he ends up in a rest home.<br /><br />Cal, in East of Eden is similar to Holden--acting out, raging, doing strange things. But all four of these books/films are about males. The world of teenage girls is different; so all the guy stuff (fighting, jealousy, possessiveness, etc.) may not come across for the female reader.<br /><br />I reread the book at age 67 and discovered that Holden could be suffering from PTSD stemming from the death of his brother and from witnessing the suicide of dorm-mate James Castle, who bailed out of a dorm window wearing the sweater Holden had loaned him. The symptoms Holden was exhibiting: depression, poor concentration, attention deficit, crying, uncontrollable rage, lack of motivation, self-isolation, sleeplessness, etc., are typical of PTSD.<br /><br />To me The Catcher in the Rye is partially about a kid struggling against the downward spiral of mental illness. Without professional help he was doomed to submerge, and did. Holden was barely &#34;holdin' on.&#34;<br /><br />There's a lot of cultural and psychological meat in there: a) how boys interact with each other when living in close quarters, b) particularly when two have or are dating the same girl (Jane Gallagher)and one feels protective or possessive of her, c) how a sensitive boy might behave because of a deep emotional wound and d) how that boy might become neurotically protective toward his younger sister and toward children in general because of c).<br /><br />Most teenagers aren't mature enough to comprehend the psychological ramifications of what I've just described unless they've been prepared for it by a mature adult who does comprehend. And there are many adults who can't.<br /><br />Most adults have psychological defenses that don't allow even them to comprehend what I've just described. It's either too abstract, too complicated or too scary. I suspect this is the main reason the book is so controversial. Most people don't get it unless someone points the way.<br /><br />A greater sense of Holden Caulfield through JD Salinger can be found in the film Finding Forester, which is purported to be based on Salinger's life. The reclusiveness of Forester appears rooted in the trauma of losing his beloved brother in a car crash.<br /><br />In World War II, Salinger was at Utah Beach at Normandy and at bloody major campaigns like the Battle of the Bulge, where Allied troops were decimated. He was among the first Allied troops to liberate a German concentration camp. He was hospitalized for battle fatigue; he understood first-hand the effects of trauma.<br /><br />In a 1953 interview with a high-school newspaper, Salinger said that the novel was &#34;sort of&#34; autobiographical: &#34;My boyhood was very much the same as that of the boy in the book ...it was a great relief telling people about it.&#34;<br /><br />Salinger, when writing The Catcher in the Rye wouldn't have had a clue about PTSD, as it wasn't even in the diagnostic manual (DSM) for psychologists until decades later. He was just writing what he felt, blasting his feelings onto paper and letting the chips fall.<br /><br />Many people see Salinger as a sort of literary genius because he sold 70 million copies of one book. I'm not saying he wasn't talented and educated; he had plenty of both going for him. I'm saying he leveraged his talent on top of some inner need to get this desperate crisis part of his life onto paper and out of his head.<br /><br />A great segment of the literary world has quite understandably interpreted Holden's PTSD symptoms as mere teenage angst, but this is a gross oversimplification. It is his masterfully presented array of extreme symptoms that is largely responsible for the success of the book.<br /><br />It's too complicated, or too sensitive, for English teachers to talk about mental illness; so they focus on the simple and more obvious interpretation. Such teachers are missing a phenomenal opportunity to reach kids who are in crisis or know someone who is. We'd have fewer cases of teenagers going postal if The Catcher in the Rye were used for exploring mental illness.<br /><br />One point of the book is the redemptive power of unconditional love, revealed and brilliantly illustrated in the climax scene at the carousel.<br /><br />Even at Phoebe's tender age, she knew how to get her point across. On the way to the carousel she digs in her heels, throws a fit, making Holden promise not to run away. Because of the depth of her devotion, Holden realizes she's doing it because she loves him, wants him to be safe and come home and return to school.<br /><br />This revelation makes him so happy he begins to cry. He shows his love for Phoebe by fussing over her, making sure she gets a good seat, watching over her as the tears stream down his face in the rain. Teenage guys are supposed to be tough, but he's &#34;practically bawling.&#34; And as if that weren't enough, Salinger practically spells it out with those two songs (&#34;Oh Marie&#34; and &#34;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes&#34;.)<br /><br />Holden wanted Sally Hayes to run away with him, but all she wanted was someone to trim the Christmas tree, skate and go to the theater with. All Jane Gallagher wanted was someone to play golf and checkers and hold hands with in a movie. The raw fierceness of Phoebe's simple, innocent devotion redeemed Holden by showing him that among all the &#34;phoniness&#34; and flaws of mankind there is a niche of happiness if we open our eyes hearts to the possibility.<br /><br />There was no one in Holden's life--not parents, not friends, not teachers, to let Holden know he was loved--except Phoebe. She proved her love by standing her ground to keep him safe. Phoebe represents family, clan or tribe. People are social creatures, like most higher forms of the animal kingdom capable of love. Love is a bonding emotion with survival implications.<br /><br />If a writer has to STATE the obvious, it ruins it for the reader, cheats the reader of that glorious &#34;Ah-ha&#34; moment of discovery, or worse, insults the reader's intelligence. But by not spelling it out, he/she runs the risk that some readers won't get it. Herein lies the artistry--the use of symbol (ducks, fish), metaphor (pond), mood setting (rain).<br /><br />Salinger strikes a balance between showing and telling, with the knowledge that some readers will get it and others will walk away shaking their heads, or come up with interpretations that he had not intended. We tend to find what we are capable of seeing, or need to.<br /><br />Nature symbols are used sparingly but effectively. Ducks flying south and the &#34;part frozen, and part not frozen&#34; pond can symbolize Holden's transitional state--neither boy nor man. The fish symbolize nature, a reminder that a natural process (&#34;Mother Nature&#34;) is taking place. The seasons come and go; we live; we die; we get sick; we get well; we get hurt; we heal. Are the Central Park ducks there to remind us that to survive and thrive we must stick together? You decide.<br /><br />A final word on the so-called &#34;Peter Pan&#34; interpretation of Holden. I find little support in the text for the position that Holden was resisting growing up.<br /><br />The passage often cited as evidence for the Peter Pan perception concerns the naked-breasted squaw diorama at the museum. Holden: The best thing, though, in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was. . . . You could go there a hundred thousand times, and that Eskimo would still be just finished catching those two fish, . . . and that squaw with the naked bosom would still be weaving that same blanket. Nobody’d be different. The only thing that would be different would be you.<br /><br />In an article in the October 14, 2014, The New York Times Sunday Review of Books, author Mendelshon says, &#34;The all-too-evident regret in that last sentence is striking — one of the novel’s many markers of Holden’s problem, which is a refusal to grow up.&#34; What regret? There is nothing in the text that conveys regret. Mendelshon may be projecting from his own history or it could be academic influence, some popular professor's interpretation that caught on because it was easy to relate to.<br /><br />Practically everyone, Youtube star John Green included, parses out this naked-breasted squaw passage and Holden's liberal use of the word &#34;phony&#34; as evidence Holden doesn't want to grow up, while overlooking a mountain of evidence to the contrary.<br /><br />Holden smokes, drinks, lies about his age, critiques theater and music performances, frequents museums, hires a prostitute, repeatedly seeks out adult conversation with peer-level engagement, acts protectively toward children. How many examples are needed to prove Holden is experimenting with adulthood? Criticizing adults as phony means he's evaluating adult behavior, not resisting. This is engagement, not avoidance.<br /><br />Note further that Holden never seeks advice from his parents, or even thinks about it. Not consulting parents shows independence of mind, the embrace of maturity, not dependency or disengagement from the responsibilities of adulthood. Holden expresses compassionate concern about his mother, indicating that she hasn't been the same since Allie died. Compassion toward a grieving parent is adult thinking.<br /><br />It shouldn't escape notice that Holden was also eagerly embracing the dessert of adulthood--sex, smoking, booze, nightclub music, dancing, flirting, dating, literature and the dramatic arts--while agonizing over the spinach of social hypocrisy and rationalization.<br /><br />So, how DO we interpret Holden's comment about the bare-breasted Native American?<br /><br />The key is in that last sentence, underlined above: &#34;The only thing that would be different would be you.&#34; Holden is telling us he is aware that he is changing. This level of intuitive self-reflection is adult thinking. It also shows maturity to appreciate that &#34;some things don't change and never should,&#34; because they are part of our cultural identity.<br /><br />Nostalgic awareness is mature thinking. Mature people want to protect and preserve cultural icons.<br /><br />Think of the loss and disorientation after the Twin Towers were destroyed. Icons like the Statue of Liberty are signposts reminding us of who and where we are. Holden was feeling lost. In his agitated state he desperately needed that bare-breasted squaw to be right where she had always been. That's all he was getting at with his comment. You Peter Pan theorists, give the kid a break and stop projecting your own history onto him.<br /><br />Holden pondered and wrote down the Wilhelm Stekel quote Mr. Antollini gave him: &#34;The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.&#34; This is another sign he was putting a lot of serious and strenuous thought into growing up.<br /><br />There are teenagers and even some adults, who resist growing up because their parents don't want to let go. They've been infantalized, encouraging dependency. Holden shows no evidence of having been infantalized. Quite the contrary, sending a kid to a military-style prep school could be evidence that Holden was too independent and possibly hard to control.<br /><br />Many readers are perplexed by the book, for it is way over the heads of many, even some who teach literature. The book must be read slowly and thoughtfully in order to absorb its meaning.<br /><br />The Catcher in the Rye even gets into the very meaning of life in the Steckel quote cited by Antolini: &#34;The mark of an immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of a mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.&#34; You can shrug your shoulders and flip the page or you can sit and ponder what it means, which could take days.<br /><br />Many readers, teens in particular, resist The Catcher in the Rye because of the book's capacity to trigger self-reflection. It resonates with their own transition from juvenile to adult, a vital period for personality development, when boys and girls become men and women and are confronted with one another's sexuality and the struggle to think and &#34;be&#34; independent from their parents.<br /><br />Check out the date rape scene in Ed Bankey's car when Holden overhears Stradlater abusing a girl in the back seat. You can't just blast through that scene without stopping to ponder your own early dating experiences.<br /><br />The evidence on the page shows that Holden was not resisting adulthood; he was aggressively embracing it. Holden was no Peter Pan.<br /><br />The book is a masterpiece of art and insight.

The Catcher in the Rye even gets into the very meaning of life in the Steckel quote cited by Antolini: &#34;The mark of an immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of a mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.&#34; You can shrug your shoulders and flip the page or you can sit and ponder what it means, which could take days.  Many readers, teens in particular, resist The Catcher in the Rye because of the book's capacity to trigger self-reflection. It resonates with their own transition from juvenile to adult, a vital period for personality development, when boys and girls become men and women and are confronted with one another's sexuality and the struggle to think and &#34;be&#34; independent from their parents.  Check out the date rape scene in Ed Bankey's car when Holden overhears Stradlater abusing a girl in the back seat. You can't just blast through that scene without stopping to ponder your own early dating experiences.   The evidence on the page shows that Holden was not resisting adulthood; he was aggressively embracing it. Holden was no Peter Pan.  The book is a masterpiece of art and insight. Who will ever get into the head of a teenage boy so deeply, so thoroughly and with such an authentic and authoritative voice?",2012-07-01

In some form or another it seems people are very disturbed at the cut and dry simplicity of the book.<br />  What Catcher lacks in plot, it makes up for with character. You either love or hate Holden, there is absolutely no in-between. Personally as someone who has suffered a lot of grief while trying to grow up and blow away I found it easy to empathize with Holden. Yes, he cusses a lot and a lot of things bug him, but honestly you must not be very observant if you did not catch some of the important questions Holden asked or some of his thoughts towards life. In Robert Burns's poem Catcher in the Rye, the original text is \\""if a body meet a body coming through the rye\\"", but Holden is mistaken and thinks the line is \\""if a body catch a body\\"". This is one of the most important elements of the novel, as it represents Holden's attachment to innocence. Holden says he wants to be the Catcher in the Rye and to catch children before they fall off the edge of the cliff, a cliff that Holden thinks he has already fallen off of.<br /> That's not to say there is no plot. Holden makes some very interesting interactions during his final days at Pencey and in New York. It is these interactions that are extremely important and show Holden's true character. For example, when Holden's room mate, Stradlater, returns from a date with Holden's old neighbor Jane Gallagher, Holden is concerned that Stradlater has had sex with her even though he doesn't even care about her. They get into a fight and Holden ends up with a bloody nose, however this is one of the first scenes that shows Holden's grip on innocence.<br /> I think it's hardest for people to relate to Holden if they've never felt the grief of the transformation intoadulthood. At the ripe age of sixteen it is easier than ever for me to understand Holden's despair. If everything could just stay the same, and we could be frozen into a period of time where we feel no longing for the past or expectations for the future, and all the phonies don't exist yet, then the heart would feel less heavy. Holden merely longs for a past we aren't even sure we can believe we had. The reader only get's to see Holden as he is now and it's disappointing for a lot of people, but it IS the story. Holden is not going to change. That's the point, he's finally gotten to the point of not changing because he's so stuck in the past. If you don't open up and let society in a little and give the phonies the time of day you might just end up a bit crazy.",2012-06-06

Salinger.  However, as I wrote the review I realized many things that led to me having a negative view of the book.  The foremost problems are the lack of a plot, the lack of character development, and the lack of ability to relate to the main character.<br /><br />The \\""plot\\"" in \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" revolves around a sixteen year old boy named Holden Caulfield.  The reader follows Holden of an aimless romp through New York City as he does whatever his mind leads him to.  There are no conflicts that lead up to a climax, and there is no definite resolution.<br /><br />The main character, Holden Caulfield, is a depressed boy who hates everything he sees.  He is constantly comparing everything to his dead brother, Allie, who he views as the only perfect person in the world.  In addition to this, Holden is both a heavy smoker and a heavy drinker.  At one point he even orders a prostitute, although he doesn't have the willpower to do anything with her.  The character is the same at both the beginning and end of the story - He doesn't want to put any effort into his schoolwork.  This shows that throughout his journey he did not improve upon his main problem.<br /><br />It is very difficult to relate to Holden because of his actions.  He acts so negatively all the time that many people cannot find redeeming qualities in him, and thus find it difficult to sympathize with Holden.  When at the end it appears as though he got no gain from his troubles it crushes the hope many readers still hold that he could improve.<br /><br />While the writing is good, good writing cannot make a story all on its own.  The lack of plot, character development, and a relatable character make this a novel that is difficult to enjoy.  There are very strong messages that are put forward in the story, but they are hard to receive.  I give \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" a 3/5.",2012-06-06

Salinger is unlike anything else I have read, and I am glad of that. This book is spoiled by the expectation that Holden is relatable to every teenager in the world. Pieces of Holden can certainly be seen in some but he is not in every man. Holden is pessimistic and unhappy with his situation but for all his complaining he has no desire to change. He chooses misery when he could attempt to achieve more.  Holden is going through an experience of finding himself that everyone faces but the expectation that everyone faces it exactly as Holden does makes the story suffocating.<br /><br />Another thing that made this book difficult for me to enjoy was the language. Adjectives are replaced with swear words, which only causes me to feel further from Holden. Yes, as a high school student I hear it often, but Holden's reliance on curse words is not present in any one I know. The language adds to the feeling that the novel is a cloud hanging over your head. Everything is grey and seems hopeless in the world Salinger creates. This assists Holden in an inability to see the good in any part of his world.  The people he comes in contact with are all phonys or perverts. While he sees himself as flawed, and accepts it, he expects everyone else to be perfect.<br /><br />Another downfall was this book's lack plot. Each event simply happens without building up to anything in particular. While what the story needs most of all is a change. This book may have once had the potential to build up to a restoration of faith in humanity, but instead it only brings forward more doubt and pessimism.<br /><br />Overall the thing I despise most about this book is that it lacks hope. There is no chance that things could get better. Everyone goes through growing up in their own way, sometimes with experiences similar to Holden's, yet each must  find something that helps them move past it. Salinger seems to have forgotten this in Catcher in the Rye.<br /><br />Despite allthese flaws, it is understandable why this book is considered a classic. Salinger does a good job of creating believable characters, whether or not you like them. The story isn't hard to wrap your head around and so it can be read quickly. Catcher in the Rye is not one I would read again, but perhaps some will find insight in this story.  I do not recommend this for anyone who is easily swayed by the things they read. It would be all too easy for such a person to adapt Holden's negative view of the world around them and forget that there is still good.",2012-06-06

People who read it either believe that it is the worst book ever, or praise it as though it were the only book that ever expressed anything worth reading. While the latter group insists that the former is missing the point of the novel, I disagree. Although I do not think that Catcher is the worst book ever, I certainly understand why many people believe that it is extremely poorly written.<br /><br /> The first complaint I have with The Catcher in the Rye is that it does not have a plot. A typical plot will have an escalating series of events, culminating in some sort of climax with a resolution. The story begins with Holden getting kicked out of Pencey Preparatory School and quickly devolves into a random collection of events that occur to him while he walks aimlessly around New York City, with no clear conflict resolution or climax. The book ends in a similarly ambiguous manner, with Holden going back to school, presumably to drop out again. Some people, however, will say that it is not necessary for a book to have a plot in order for it to be good. Those people will claim that it is enough to have characters that are interesting, relatable, and have interacting interactions with one another.<br /><br /> Shockingly, The Catcher in the Rye manages to skillfully dodge having either of those. J.D. Salinger does a remarkable job of keeping Holden from changing, or learning anything that could improve his negative life outlook. For example, at the beginning of the novel, Holden is shown flunking out of school due to a lack of applying himself, and at the very end, he is shown saying that he doesn't really know if he's going to apply himself when he goes to his next school. From this, it is obvious that Holden has not developed or learned anything from his trip. This only adds to the fact that Holden is not relatable to the majority of people, especially not the teenagers who often proclaim to enjoy the book. The actions Holden goes through, from getting drunk when he goes to the bar, to ordering a prostitute, are so outside what the average 16 year old does that the character loses any semblance of similarity to the typical teenager.<br /><br /> Secondly, Holden's personality is one of the things that make me dislike the book. This is due to the fact that Holden complains about everything that he sees, and even admits to Phoebe at the end of the book that he can't think of anything he especially likes. It is also extremely difficult for Holden to be likeable, considering he brings most of his troubles upon himself. For instance, Holden gets beat up by a pimp after ordering a prostitute and refusing to pay her the full fee she asks. Then later, Holden complains that he's probably going to die of pneumonia, after getting drunk, soaking his head, and not drying his hair before going out into the freezing cold. As these events are clearly caused by his own poor choices that he could easily avoid, it is difficult to sympathize with Holden. While it is true that some events in Holden's life, such as Allie's death, were beyond his control, he displays a clear inability to deal positively with grief and move on with his life, as he keeps trying to tell Phoebe that Allie is the only thing he likes in life, despite Allie having been dead for years.<br /><br /> Due to the fact that the book lacks the main characteristics which define a good novel, it is difficult to accept the claim that it is truly an example of excellent literature. The Catcher in the Rye lacks a relatable main character, a true plot, and any semblance of character development.",2012-06-06

Rather, he just comes off as one very messed up kid.  It feels more like an early picture of mental illness - of someone dealing with depression or OCD - than anything to do with the human condition.

A 17 year old boy who's struggling to come to terms with the commitments and responsibilities that a well-adjusted adulthood requires. One who's cynicism and lack of obedience call into question his psychological disposition, as well as his ability to make the transition into adulthood successfully.<br /><br />The lengthy meditations on his childhood museum trips, the summer days spent with Jane and especially, the brother he lost, all betray Holden's nostalgia for the past. And further contribute to the question of his maturity. All together, he can't deal with anything, doesn't like anything and can't do anything right. We learn right away that he can't even keep track of his sporting equipment.<br /><br />Or is it that Holden is one of the sensitive ones, one who sees through it all?<br /><br />A clever reader isn't supposed to buy into this cleverness. He is awful smart, though. And observant for a young kid. We're supposed to question his reliability as a narrator because, well, because he's blinded by his own disdain for everything.<br /><br />But Salinger's nascent tendency and leanings toward eastern spirituality serve as an indication of the root of his protagonist's general discomfort in life. The illusory world, defined by material gain and interest, is ripe for all manner of game playing--games less innocent than Jane's checkers. Piercing this veil, seeing through this world of appearances and machinations, where conformity gets you the prize, the approval and a good lay, is no small feat.<br /><br />And for your accomplishment, you end up looking like the weirdo. It almost makes you think of Camus' The Stranger, especially the beginning of that book, when Camus' lead couldn't grieve for his mother in the way that was expected by society. Oh, the absurdity of a manufactured, or as Holden is wont to say, a phony emotion!<br /><br />Even though our young Holden Caulfield is smart, he's getting the ax. Again. Why? Mostly for his lack of conformity. He doesn't write papers exactly as instructed (even though there's no lack of creativity, as evidenced by the paper he wrote for Stradlater), nor does he join in the testosterone-fueled, group jeer-fest, just because some kid digressed in his classroom speech.<br /><br />Everyone's a phony. It's all artificial. Artificial, just like his brother's Hollywood, itself--the very same Hollywood that took a good writer and reduced him to a tool.

The way it's written, the main character, or outdated social norms seem to annoy many people to the point where they can no longer even attempt to enjoy or find meaning in the novel. People fail to see how original this book is, considering the fact that it was written at a time in which questioning the norm would be frowned upon. And this book questions everything about our society and culture that most just willingly accepted.<br /><br />Catcher in the Rye is an odd recollection of a couple days in the life of the main character, Holden Caulfield. The story is an interwoven thread of Holden's account of this time and his past memories, thoughts, and feelings, that pull the story way off topic. It's jumbled, it's clumsy, it's amusingly random, and yet it's so real. Holden's voice stays true and consistent throughout, and it feels like he's talking right to you and explaining his world to you as best as he can. There are no frills, no exquisite detail or anything else added to the story. It's straightforward and direct.<br /><br />The way the story is told definitely something a lot of readers will hate. The improper grammar also will cause some to cringe.<br /><br />Readers also may not like the digressions, or the slow pace, or the long ramblings Holden sometimes falls into.<br /><br /> It all depends on what you think makes good writing. If you think of good writing in the sense of correct grammar, beautiful descriptions and  a flowing plot that moves constantly forward, you will probably dislike this book.<br /><br />But if you read it with the hope of getting into the mind of a troubled teenager and learning about the way he sees the world, I think you will enjoy this book. I think that a lot of people will be able to identify with Holden and his feelings and confusion and worries. And although things have changed a lot since the time the novel takes place in, I found that almost everything could be adapted to fit in today's world. The ideas behind everything are just as true today. However, the reader has to remember that people had different viewpoints at that time than today, and so a lot of viewpoints were different.<br /><br />This book is wonderful. I was skeptical at first, but after reading this story, I found so much I could connect with and so much that is and will forever be true to humanity.

I actually do find the writing to be brilliant, but the story's plot, characters, dialogue and narration are frustrating and boring. There is so much slang that it is extremely, staunchly stuck in its period. I think Salinger could have gone so much further with less slang and vulgarity. You understand right away that the main character is immature and makes no growth throughout the whole story, but the repetitive slang and vulgarity becomes a distraction and diminishes other things that Salinger tries to accomplish. How come I still find it to be brilliant? Because I think Salinger wrote it the way he did intentionally. I think he wants every flaw of Caulfield to stand out in blaring fashion. I think he wants the period to be captured in cement, to have this work stand as a testimony to the deep-seated narcissism in the adolescents of that day, or maybe adolescence in general. I am sure that Salinger has expressed his intentions and the many intellectuals have a better understanding of what he wanted to accomplish, but I find it ironic that the story is held up so enthusiastically as a model for coming of age and adolescent rebellion.

He is unlikable and selfish although in his heart he does not want to be either of those things. And I guess that is why in the end I like this novel.

School, again. He has a cynical, sarcastic tone as he talks about all the phonies in his life. After a fight with his roommate Stradlater he leaves early and goes to New York City. For two days Holden proceeds to meet up with old friends and teachers from the past, make them mad, and get drunk. After seventeen years of life Holden is just fed up with everything and everyone, but deep down you can tell he's hurting. He talks a lot about his brother, Allie who died of cancer, and how he used to write poems on his baseball mitt so that he'd have something to read while in the outfield. Holden also mentions his sister Phoebe a lot, and how she's probably the only person in the world that isn't fake. Most of the story is pointless, but it had a pretty good theme. The theme of Catcher in the Rye is that of coming of age and growing up. Holden is afraid to grow up because he thinks the adult world is phony. The reader can tell Holden is worried that no one will ever be real with him once he's an adult, and that they'll just tell him what he wants to hear.<br /> After reading the book I have to say it won't ever be a favorite of mine. Holden is rude, crude, and not very friendly. I can't really tell what the book was trying to say, or what message it had. Even though Catcher in the Rye isn't the nicest book in the world I liked how forward it was. The author, J.D. Salinger wasn't afraid to make Holden a bad boy who liked to swear, and openly hate almost everyone. It's a bold and daring book epically for its time, that's why I give it a three out of five stars. Catcher in the Rye is very out there, and I would only recommend it to people who don't mind, profanity, \\""adult\\"" subject matter, and those who are over the age of thirteen.

It is what it is and stands out like a sore thumb in the history of literature. If nothing else, it is unique that's for sure.<br /><br />It is most certainly a classic, but whether that's due to quality of story or other more unusual reasons is open to debate...<br /><br />The novel is definitely not an easy read. It's character-driven, rather than plot focused. Not a great deal happens in terms of events, it's more about what happens within Holden's mind. Therefore, it's veering strongly toward a literary style...Problem is, the writing style is not really strong enough to be an all-out literary classic in my opinion. Then again, it is held up as a literary classic by many (perhaps most?) critics. So often readers come to this novel expecting so much, then soon end up being seriously disappointed - as is evidenced by the large amount of 1-star reviews here on Amazon. Many have commented they couldn't even finish it - few if any other literary classics receive this level of criticism. But this is of course offset by the amount of readers who view it as the greatest novel ever written.<br /><br />So basically it divides readers. People either love or hate it. Personally, I love the first-person intimacy of it, but also hate the repetitiveness of the story. Reading Catcher is like being in a like a loop you can't get out of, but strangely there is a side of yourself that enjoys it! Weird. The book defies normal story logic in a way. It could be a 5-star or could just as easily be a 1-star book, I can't say for sure...therefore, out of confusion, I give it 3 stars.<br /><br />It is strange in a way that this book is part of the curriculum and compulsory reading for high school students in most Western Hemisphere countries. That doesn't seem to add up given the highly rebellious and anti-social nature of the book, plus its dubious literary quality.<br /><br />What adds complexity to the whole Catcher legend is that numerous serial killers, assassins have had a copy (or in some cases numerous copies) of this book on them when killing...while other murderers have been found to have multiple copies in their homes, many with notes scribbled on every single page...the most famous examples: Copies of Catcher were found on the men behind the assassination and attempted assassination of John Lennon and Ronald Reagan respectively...",2012-02-26

The way he forms his sentences, his word choices, his perspectives, his actions - they are all SO irritating and horrible. I realize that the character is not supposed to be the brightest light in the pack, or the most likable fellow, but often the unlikable characters in a story or film end up being very likable to me in their own satirical way. I am an extremely sarcastic person and also slightly sadistic with humor - typically I relate with cynics over everyone else, but Holden is not even an effective character in that light. When he shares a paragraph's worth of his thoughts with me, I simply want to punch him in the nose, or at least go on ignoring the fact that people this annoying actually exist on this planet.<br /><br />It was ridiculously challenging getting all the way through this book. He never shuts up, and there is not much change in the pace or events throughout. It's simply a wandering, rambling, BORING teen who thinks he's too good for everything in life, complaining nonstop about the same things repetitively - typically this would sound like a fun read to me, but the problem is that it's NOT entertaining in any way. It was SO unmemorable and stale that the only two segments in the entire story that I can even recall at this point, just one week after finishing it, are a section towards the middle involving a motel room and a hooker, and the book's last couple of chapters.<br /><br />The one thing and only thing I DID like about the book, was the meaning of the book's title and how relevant it was when looking at the entire story as a whole.

In this book we meet, Holden Caulfield, the protagonist of the story. He is best described as a very judgmental and bitter person who is lost in life. He thinks that everything in life is just phony and fake. He wants to stay a kid and have fun instead of becoming more adult-like and facing the real hardships in life. Holden doesn't really like anyone, and he never takes anyone seriously except for his little sister Phoebe and his dead brother Allie. Phoebe Caulfield is not introduced until the middle of the book. She is very mature for a 10-year-old; she's even more mature than Holden. She listens to him and understands him unlike everyone else in the novel. Ackley and Stradlater are two guys who Holden knew from Pencey Prep. He describes them as mean and phony people. Mr. Antolini is Holden's old English teacher at one of his other schools. He is someone who Holden actually likes. Mr. Antolini is a very intelligent person who tries to help Holden in life. The main conflict in this novel is internal. Holden is his own enemy. He fights with himself on what to do in life. He doesn't have a goal or plan that he can attempt pursue. A significant event that makes up the rising action is when Holden decided to leave Pencey Prep early because it is the last good-bye. It symbolizes that Holden is now on his own without a plan of what he is going to do. He is just going to take it day by day. Another significant even is when Holden decides to stay at the Edmont Hotel because it marks the beginning of Holden journey and adventure.  Overall I liked The Catcher in the Rye. It really caught my attention and made me want to keep reading. I liked that I had to keep guessing throughout the book. I never knew what Holden was going to do next. For instance, I would've never guessed that Holden would get emotional before leaving Pencey. I also liked the love that Holden had for his dead brother Allie. For example, when Stradlater told Holden to do his assignment, Holden wrote about Allie's baseball glove. Finally, I dislike Holden's personality and behavior. I don't like when he lies or criticizes and judges someone. I didn't like when he lied to Ernest Morrow's mother. I would recommend this book because it is very interesting and surprising.

From here we experience him in the adult world, spending money, staying in hotels, experiencing (or trying to) sex. Meanwhile we are introduced to his mind. The character has a very speculative, cynical outlook which shows a sense of Salinger reaching deep inside himself to portray these complex and incredible emotions. It's a powerful portrayal of a misunderstood state of mind. Or perhaps I'm just thinking way too deeply about it. Either way, this is one of the best reads I've ever had.  Long story short, I think this is amazing. Right from the first page I was hooked. I'm very much on the same level as Caulfield. His mind set is similar to my own, and he came to life right before my eyes. It's difficult to put my finger on why I love this novel so much, I think it's because of how introspective it is. I spend a lot of my time thinking, and I suppose that aspect of my personality transcends the form of this story. For my own reasons, this is one of my favorite novels. I think that the majority of people can relate to this, as there will always be things in this world that anger us, and this is a brilliant indulgence in the cynical side of ourselves.  From what I've experienced in other reviews, there's a divide between those who think the character is unappreciative and the novel simply boring, and people who say it is a brilliant classic.

Salinger explores the \\""phoniness\\"" of the adult world and one boy's attempt to stay young as Holden tells his story from the mental institution he is currently living in.  Though Salinger employs many stylistic elements that increase the literary merit of the novel, there were also a few elements that were subpar.     In order to mimic the teenage point of view Salinger is writing from, he uses stream of consciousness.  Most of the time the stream of consciousness is well used, but there are also many times where it leads to rants about details that don't have any importance to the plot.  It causes the reader to lose interest and gives the book a sense of invalidity.  Rather than focusing on the themes of phoniness and youth, readers become lost in the never ending details.     However, the stream of consciousness does highlight the immaturity of Holden.  It makes the book relatable for those who are coming of age and brings to life the teenage point of view.  The provocative language also helps bring to light Holden's immature state of mind.  He talks in teenage vernacular that was unusual for novels during that time period.     The ideas Salinger struggles with throughout the novel make the book an essential read for young adults who relate to the struggles Holden experiences.  Though some of the actual events are outdated, the theme behind it is still relevant today.  As we get older, we learn the truths of the world and realize just how phony people can be.  We often don't want to grow up, but just like Holden we are forced to join the adult world.     Salinger provides one of the greatest coming of age novels of the 20th century.  It is a timeless classic that continues to be read years later.

I finished it in about a day and I read it again the following year, and the year after that, and the one after that. I'm 18 now and I just finished reading it again. I find it somewhat disturbing that I was so attached to this book almost immediately. I understand now how much I am like Holden. When I was younger I was kind of...well, slightly weirder than I am now. I usually would prefer to read a book with a female protagonist. I guess I assumed that I'd be able to relate to a character who was of the same sex as myself. That's ironic, seeing as I've never been able to relate to a character more than I am able to relate to Holden. My point is, it's hard to appreciate this novel with all of the hype surrounding it. Most people find it boring and slow because they're just expecting something more exciting. It isn't a fast paced story and Holden's constant whining can get annoying, but it's an honest tale of a confused and lost teenage boy. It's at times witty, beautiful, and sad. I usually feel somewhat lonely when I re-read it.

His love for his sister in particular was a powerful antidote to a kind of dark nihilism that might otherwise threaten the work.

Salinger's writing style does a good job of capturing the stream-of-consciousness thought process of a 16 year old boy. Unfortunately, about midway through the book it became very repetitious and formulaic to the point where I could have produced dialogue for Holden on my own. I don't believe a main character has to be likable for a book to succeed, but Holden was irritating to the point where I had to force myself to continue on with the book. He constantly labels others as phonies when he is, without a doubt, the biggest phony in the novel. He is constantly seeking the company of others to ease his loneliness, but proceeds to find fault with everyone he meets. And, quite understandably, no one, except his sister Phoebe, wants his company.  I must ask those who have given this book five stars, would you want to spend 10 minutes with this whiny, spoiled, ungrateful, self-centered narcissist?   On the upside, Salinger does redeem the Holden slightly when we become privy to Holden's thoughts on his little sister and dead brother. The relationship between Phoebe and Holden is quite touching, and I was glad I didn't give up on the novel when I reached the part where Phoebe showed up at the museum with her suitcase so she could run away with her brother. I found Phoebe to be an infinitely more interesting character than Holden.    I felt as though Salinger deceives his readers by introducing Holden's memories of James Castle, a boy who jumped to his death after a group of boys entered his dorm room and demanded he apologize for a slur he made to a member of the group. The boy refused to apologize to the very end. I thought this might be an indication that Holden was finally going to take a stand against all the \\""phonies\\"" and do something with his life to free himself from the quagmire of hypocrisy in which he seems to be drowning. Normallyat this point I would issue a spoiler alert, but I can't spoil the ending more than the author. Other than Holden realizing the important role his sister and dead brother played in his life, NOTHING happens. NOTHING!       Other reviewers seem to be able to relate to Holden, I was unable to do so. My high school and college years were simultaneously the best times and the worst times of my life. I encountered plenty of phonies, but I also met some of the most genuine and decent people I've met in my entire life.   Finally, I think if you were rip off the cover and hand this book to 100 people who have never read it, I believe the reviews would not be quite so glowing. I'm sure many people truly love this book, but I think there are many who claim to love it because it's been declared an American classic, and do not want to appear incapable of appreciating what their peers claim to be a great novel. I guess one might refer to them as phonies. ;-)",2011-08-28

However, I was a teen, and I did recognize that people lied all the time, about things big and little, and that politics lied, also, mouthing platitudes about our all being free and equal -- in the days when African-Americans were not permitted to ride the same busses or drink from the same fountains or sit in the same waiting rooms as whites. So, despite my initial skepticism, I began to feel great empathy with Holden, who wanted adults to be responsible and honest.

The story revolves around Holden Caulfield, a teenager who has just been kicked out of a fancy prep school called Pencey because he flunked all his classes save English.  He talks about his indifference of being expelled because he doesn't much care for school and he felt as if all the people there are \\""phonies\\"" and he even has a physical altercation with one of them.<br /><br />He then decides to leave and not go home to his parents but instead hang out in New York for 3 days living like an \\""adult\\"", smoking, drinking, staying out late, hanging out in bars, even buying a prostitute.  Throughout the book, he is just trying to find someone to talk to that he can connect with, but he never seems to manage to do so.  Holden even seems a bit crazy at times, he'll feel so strongly about someone or something for a moment and then the next moment he hates that person or thing.<br /><br />After all the living he does in New York he decides to head home and sneak in the house, not to see his parents, but his sister Phoebe, who he's crazy about.  Phoebe is pleased to see him, but gets angry with him when she realizes he was flunked out of Pencey.  She tells him it's because he doesn't have any ambition and doesn't like anything and doesn't want to do anything with his life.  Holden disagrees, and after thinking it through says there is something he wants to do with his life, he has this strange fantasy to be standing at the edge of a cliff watching a group of children playing a game on a field of rye grass, and every time a child gets too close and is about to fall off the cliff, Holden would catch them and save them from falling.  He wants to be the catcher in the rye.<br /><br />After he sees Phoebe, he leaves and heads to an old English teacher of his, Mr. Antonili.  Once there, Mr. Antonili gives him a place to stay for the night and gives him a lecture on life.  He tells him that the mark of the mature man is to live humbly for a cause, while the mark of an immature man is to die nobly for one, which is in contrast with Holden's idea of being the \\""catcher in the rye.\\""  After the lecture Holden goes to sleep but wakes up to find Mr. Antonili rubbing his head, which Holden perceives as a sexual advance and he rushes out the door to sleep in Grand Central Station for a few hours.<br /><br />Holden then decides he will hitchhike out West and get a job as a gas station attendant and live in a cabin right by the woods.  Before he tries to leave he heads to Phoebe's school so he can wish her goodbye.  He gives the secretary a note to give to Phoebe telling her he's leaving and to meet him at the museum so he can say goodbye.  But when she shows up, she's carrying a suitcase and says she's going with him.  When he tells her no and to shut up, she starts to cry, depressing Holden.  Holden then says he changed his mind and he's going to stay and they should go to the zoo together.He begins walking to the zoo and Phoebe walks along opposite side of the street, following him but trying to avoid him.  After the zoo Holden takes Phoebe to the carousel, while he watches her ride it, he realizes that he cannot be the \\""catcher in the rye,\\"" that he needs help himself.  So at the end of the novel we are talking to him in the future, he is in a some sort of hospital getting better, and is seeing a psychoanalyst, and even says he will be going to a new school soon.  When asked if Holden will actually apply himself this time, Holden says, \\""How can you know you're going to do something until you do it\\""  he says he will try to do better.  He ends with saying he misses his all the people that are mentioned in this book, both the good and the bad.<br /><br />What amazed me the most about this book, besides the fact that it was banned, was how well the author told the story.  I mean, if you think about it, nothing all that special even happened in this book.  If someone just came up and started telling me the plot and events of this story, I would say, \\""Sounds boring\\"" and move on, and this book would have been boring, if it weren't for the fact that Holden is such a good story-teller.  The character development is amazing in this book, maybe the best I've seen in any book.  The storytelling is what made this book, otherwise it would have flopped, a movie would not have nearly the same effect on me as the book did because as I said, nothing really all that interesting even happened to Holden.

Also, what's even more ironic, the fact that they made a movie when the main character, Holden, hated movies and actors and the like.  Seems like an injustice to this book to make a movie, if you ask me.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, i really enjoyed this book, but I must say it left me asking for more.  He kept speaking of Jane but never actually talks to her, we never even meet her, I was waiting the whole novel for that.  You never get to hear from his parents, how did they take all that had happened? and what happened, did Holden stay in school, I mean so many things are left unexplained and I hate that, if you're going to invest our time in a set of characters then finish the story, that's the reason for the 4 stars, I can't get past that I'm sorry.<br /><br />But all in all, a great book, I'd recommend it to anyone.  Heck, even kids, better they read a novel like this than listen to rap cds and play violent video games and just rot their brain cells away.

Both of these books were published in the early 1950s, and, although contemporaries and sharing similar themes, have gone in opposite directions, imo, in the past fifty years.  Although both are still heralded as prime examples of 20th century literature, there is no question in my mind that Salinger's book is as relevant today as it was in the 1950s, although not nearly as shocking, whereas the shock value of Kerouac's book has completely worn off as the childish antics involving drugs, alcohol, and sex have been eclipsed by current generations of young people whose excesses go far beyond anything described in On the Road.  Without the shock value, Kerouac's book has no meaning for me, just a 300-page drunken binge.  The Catcher in the Rye, on the other hand, remains true to its original theme of teenage distrust, rebellion, and the search for one's own identity and meaning in life.  IMO, of these two books, Catcher is the only one worth reading today.",2011-08-08

I've read some reviews here, and while some people dislike the writing style, a lot of negative comments are because the reviewer doesn't like the main character, Holden Caulfield. Just as I titled this review, I don't like him either. He's self-righteous and \\""modestly\\"" narcissistic and he is at times, incredibly immature. But he is a truly flawed character and he does have a sense of innocence below the façade. Holden talks a lot--he talks up a big game about himself and the things he did during the time after he was kicked out of prep school. But, what I love, is that underneath all the talk is a very obvious tone of \\""I want someone to like me.\\"" He is a sheep wearing the ill-fitting skin of a lion. That comes out strongly in the end as well when he describes the famous namesake of being the catcher in the rye.     The way in which this story was written exudes that lost, but achingly lonely undertone. The language tries to be intelligent, but is sprinkled with frustrated swearing and reiteration. The narrator sometimes gets off topic because he's obviously trying to talk a story up from what it really is. He doesn't really succeed, either.     This book, as I read it, is a look in to a personality. A very detailed look. I think it is in that way what Salinger referred to as \\""autobiographical.\\"" The plot of this book is to try and understand who Holden Caulfield is and how he is the epitome of everything he hates.     I don't think it is about his \\""refusal to grow up,\\"" but instead about his cautious fear of growing up. He very obviously wants to as we can see when he actually says something profound or worldly. But it's quickly glazed over with a \\""you know\\"" or \\""I don't know\\"" statement.     So, no, Holden is not a hero. He is not something to look up to and he never claims to be. He is, instead, a real person. And there are alot of people out there like him. I am a little astonished that so many people expected him to be a hero, that, after reading the book, said \\""I can't imagine who would look up to Holden Caulfield.\\"" No one should. This book in so wonderful because it is not a harrowing tale or a story of a fictional event that could only happen once. It's not a story about someone who survives a horrific torture or gains a superpower. Nor is it about a good Samaritan who gets theirs in the end. There is not an evil force or an antagonist, and I'd venture to say there isn't truly a protagonist, either, because the second-person narration leads to some biases in that area. It is just a story. A story of a boy to whom a lot of people can connect with personally or because they know someone like him. It's a study of a certain type of humanity, I think. It's universal and crosses the time barrier, as well. The slang may be different, but these feelings and traits still exist today.    Perhaps what I like the most is that it ends just the way a real story would...with life going on.",2011-08-08

As the enlightened generation, we could see similarities and comparisons to ourselves to Holden. What was amazing is that he was the more paranoid, the more disturbed, but yet the universal hero among young people. Now, having read it 40 years later, I was able to notice the depths of his plunge in the anti-society group of one he had developed. I could more easily visualize the rapid decline of his sanity.

Now I have finally broken down and read it. I found it an engaging read, I think Salinger is a great writer based on this book alone, but it has one grave fault, it is n0t a novel. It reads more like a memoir, I found no conflict in it, Holden Caulfield is still the same horribly spoiled brat he was at the beginning, there are no changed circumstances, a few days have passed in the protagonists life but at the end he is still dismissed from school, he still does not know what he is going to do with himself, he still carries the same judgments about others that he started with. And we readers have a magnificent view of a fictional character's personality. If I had anything to say about the book, I would recommend it to any creative writing class as an example of how to develop a character, make him come alive, be some one you know. While I was reading the book, that is the way I felt, like I knew Holden Caulfield. I also must confess I hated him, still hate him, and every time he said, \\""I really meant it.\\"" I wanted Stradlater to be there and give him another crack on the jaw. I realized Salinger had given him these specific peculiarities to define him but he had done too good a job for me, I thought Caulfield was real.  There are several minor characters in the book, Salinger has done a fine job in defining them, giving them just enough definition to support their role in the book. None of them take the emphasis from Holden, not even the prostitute and the elevator man. Others are just like them, even Hunt and Fontayne are as seen through Caulfield's eyes and no attempt is made to upgrade them. Since Holden Caulfield thinks every one else, with only a couple of exceptions, are phonies or morons, his opinions must be right and that is carried on throughout the book. Salinger does a good job of it, it never seems to be his opinion, always Caulfield. That gets to be boring. And i found no conclusion to the book.

When Holden is talking to his teacher Mr. Spencer, they have this conversation:   \\""Life is a game, boy. Life is a game that one plays according to the rules.\\""   \\""Yes, sir. I know it is.

K tells me this is fancily called the stream of consciousness. I'm not sure about the fancy but I loved the way that this really drew me into the descriptive experiences that Holden was thinking about. Holden has an excellent sense of humor and his (mostly sarcastic) observations were witty and entertaining.<br /><br />His attitude is one thing I'm torn over. While it is his story and it needs to have pieces of Holden in the narrative, he was very self-absorbed and this started to annoy me about half way through. Holden is a teenager and they generally pretty self-centered but something about this rubbed me the wrong way. Cocky and amusing, his attitude permeated every paragraph and thought and it definitely knocked down my enjoyment of the book. Still, it definitely wouldn't have been the same without it. I can absolutely see why generations of teenagers have fallen so hard for this book though; it is very easy to relate to with Holden as the imperfect, misunderstood and most important character in this, the story of his holiday.<br /><br />Another element I did enjoy though, was how Holden, as a character within his own story, was visibly developed over the pages. I am always appreciative of growth and a smidge of self-awareness in the person I'm reading about. The side characters were well created too. Each had a specific contribution to propel Holden's adventures and were either adored or disdained as appropriate. For the most part, I agreed with Holden's assessment and we absolutely got enough background on each to justify his conclusions.<br /><br />Final ramblings: I can definitely see the comparison between this and The Perks of Being a Wallflower and in retrospect I wish I had read Catcher in the Rye first, it probably would have made a lot more sense. Again, it is one of those books that I wish I had read when I was younger, 15 perhaps, when it would have made more of an impression.

At that time, I had little experience in reading deeper than the plot.  To my younger self, the book was boring and pointless, a journey around town with no mission.  Its only saving graces were the alcohol and sex references that peppered the story.  That memory is long ago forgotten.<br />When the report was assigned, I was in trouble, for early American literature fails to excite me.  Thankfully, a wonderful book was pointed my way, and J. D. Salinger opened my mind.<br /><br />I read The Catcher in the Rye once again, and this time, it was more than a boring journey.  It was a Homeric journey through New York City.  As I read, I personally noticed some odd parallels to Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.  In my mind, Salinger kicked Jim off the raft, and dropped the raft into the middle of a swinging New York.<br /><br />After further research, I realized that I wasn't the first person to notice this fact.  In fact, the compilations of essays in the library were riddled with comparisons.  This makes it hard to narrow your wide array of possible sources into a scant three.<br />Well, it appears that my phoniness detector is raging at full-blast, so I will finish the bull and answer the question I posed myself when reading The Catcher in the Rye.<br /><br />IS HOLDEN CAULFIELD THE MODERN DAY HUCKLEBERRY FINN?<br /><br />As I have stated, there are many similarities between the characters of Huck and Holden.  In fact there are so many, I can't even begin to think where to start.  With that in mind, I will draw a random card from the pile, and let my thoughts flow from there.<br /><br />The First and most striking similarity that is shared by both Holden and Huck is their use of language.  As Carpenter noted, like Huck Finn, The Catcher in the Rye is narrated in the first person, by a boy who is badly \\""mixed up\\"".  One can notice the use of uneducated vernacular in both novels. (Holden) has a colloquialism as marked as Huck's.  The language is different, but Huck's dialect stands out on the river as much as Holden's vulgar language stands out on the streets of New York.<br /><br />Another similarity that has been noticed is that \\""the quality that makes Huck Finn and Holden Caulfield brothers...is a common hatred of hypocrisy and a search for integrity.\\""  In fact the wanders of both characters were filled with, more than anything, a search for the truth.  Holden so desperately wished to get away from the phonies, the perverts, and the like.  What he searched for was an inner truth, an answer to the inner monsters that plagued him.  While Holden traveled twisted paths in his mind Huck's journey was more physical.  He looked redemption in his family, peace in the south, and an end to the hypocrisy that is slavery for Jim.<br /><br />Both shared journeys.  The journey to manhood just happened to be a part of it.  For the heck of it, let's use a quote!  \\""The journey...from holy innocence to such knowledge that the world offers\\"".  Even though the respective adventures were of far different lengths of time, the effects on the characters were similar.  At the end of the novels, we see characters that want to get away.<br /><br />\\""In the end, Huck plans to \\""light out for the territory\\"", and Holden has thoughts of fleeing west\\"".<br />You see \\""These heroes desperately seek truth\\"", and in the end it scared them.  The eternal truth is that life is not as beautiful as they want you to believe.<br /><br /> It's not to say that Holden and Huck were carbon copies.  They had their differences, but that is to be expected of two boys from different times, different places.  \\""Where Huck lived in the rich heartland of America, Holden is the product of an exclusive New York City\\"".  Huck had outlets for hisenergy, be it Jim, or the commotion they caused on the banks of the mighty river.  \\""(Holden) has objects for his contempt, but no objects other than his sister for his love-no raft, no river, no Jim, no Tom\\"".  Holden was alone, even when surrounded with people.  Huck always had a friend close.<br /><br /> Holden thought he had some friends, but they flirted with other boys.  Even worse, some of them flirted with him.  In the end, Holden feels alone, and unloved.  Huck, on the other hand, always has trusted friends close at hand.  It is Tom or Jim, but there is always someone for Huck to lean on. Friends are what make the man.<br /><br />IS HOLDEN CAULFIELD THE MODERN DAY HUCKLEBERRY FINN?<br /><br />To tell the truth, I had already made my mind up about the answer to my question before I even cracked abook.  Yes, Salinger skillfully recreated Huck, and placed him in the middle of New York City.  If this was the idea, I don not know, but the product is unmistakable.  Sure, there are differences, but my theory is that Salinger changed some details to avoid a plagiary rap, but that is another paper altogether.energy, be it Jim, or the commotion they caused on the banks of the mighty river.  \\""(Holden) has objects for his contempt, but no objects other than his sister for his love-no raft, no river, no Jim, no Tom\\"".

This is why I never read it as a teen myself - reluctantly getting around to it in my mid-20's just to find out why it's considered such a \\""classic.\\"" Now I must say, \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" is truly brilliant.<br /><br />The novel chronicles the misadventures of Holden Caulfield, a maladjusted teenager wandering around New York City. Holden picks a fight with his roommate, tells tall tales to strangers he meets, and has awkward encounters with an ex-schoolmate's mother, tourists, a prostitute and her pimp, an ex-girlfriend, a former teacher, and his little sister - all the while narrating about his sexual frustrations, expressing concern for what he sees as the loss of innocence in children, lamenting the death of his brother, and (most infamously) airing his disdain for \\""phony\\"" people.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I think many of the people who love this book largely miss the point. Holden Caulfield is no hero. He's irresponsible, childish, and hypocritical. (For someone who hates phonies, he seems to love misrepresenting himself to the various people he meets. He also entertains some pretty misogynistic thoughts, after starting a fight over the honor of a girl he cares for.) He's sarcastic, bitter, and cynical beyond his years, and I'll be damned if the kid doesn't whine!<br /><br />But I feel the severe critics of the book are far more off base. Sure, Holden's no hero, but he's nobody to hate, either. His angst and frustration stem from his truly being a sensitive, altogether good person, and his concern for children is pure (albeit misguided). Let's not forget he's also a teenager, with all the confusion, angst, alienation, and sexual frustration that comes with the territory. Holden Caulfield is certainly a flawed character, but one I think most people can sympathize with and relate to as an extreme, characterized version of their adolescent selves.<br /><br />My favorite part of the novel has to be when he pays a visit to an admired former English teacher of his, Mr. Antolini. Mr. Antolini (having had a few cocktails) tells the young Caulfield \\""I have a feeling that you're riding for some kind of a terrible, terrible fall\\"" - a statement that contrasts sharply with Holden's \\""catcher\\"" fantasy. Mr. Antolini quotes the psychologist Wilhelm Stekel:<br /><br />\\""The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of a mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.\\""<br /><br />And what does Holden do with these words of wisdom? He abruptly leaves (having mistaken the intent of Mr. Antolini's affections).<br /><br />While reading \\""The Catcher in the Rye,\\"" I often found myself wishing I could talk to Holden Caulfield. At times I wanted to give him a Linus-style \\""you're a good man, Charlie Brown\\"" kind of pep talk. Other times, I wanted to pat him on the back and assure him that things would get better. And yes, there were times that I just wanted to reach through the pages and strangle him for a while. Such is the beauty of Salinger's masterpiece. For better or worse, you are always emotionally engaged.<br /><br />I've only read \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" once, and that was a couple years ago. I was so completely absorbed by the story, I felt that I had absorbed it myself. Up until now, I've never felt the need to reread the book, but after writing this review, I think I might pick it up again. As Holden says, \\""Don't ever tell anybody anything.

Among them:    -His unparalleled use of vivid description  -The addictive \\""stream of consciousness\\"" style of writing  -His relentless general disgust with the \\""phony\\""-ness of most of humanity  -The way he makes a seamless connection between and/or segues into two usually completely unrelated things  -The way he's able to draw so many thoughts out of what is really a small amount of time (I believe the story takes place in 2-3 days total)      But there are things that fascinate me in ways I can't truly describe.

The story fully embodies the concept of a coming of age novel.  The characterization, setting and writing style all further the theme of preservation of innocence.  The Catcher in the Rye is a must read for every individual who finds themselves in a corrupt, phony world.  The Catcher in the Rye is set in 1950's New York City, covering the few days proceeding Holden Caulfield's  flunking out of Pencey Prep.  Holden's personal history is relayed throughout the novel.  His past appears scarred and his psyche damaged by various events both within and out of his control.  The most significant of these events is his thirteen year old brother, Allie's death.  Throughout the story, Holden keeps this brother's baseball mitt; a symbol of lost youth.   Many characters appear in The Catcher in the Rye.  Holden seems to analyze each individual with more than a little distortion.  The only characters free of his hypercriticism are children.  In fact, every time Holden sees an innocent, happy child, Holden claims to feel, \\""less depressed.\\""  This exposes Holden's desire for innocence and his loathing of the adult world.  Two characters truly realize this notion namely, Phoebe and Allie, Holden's younger sister and brother.  Holden seems to love these two above any in his life.  He greaves Allie and he claims Phoebe is the only person in the world with whom he perpetually yearns to speak.  His relationship with every character further distinguishes his drive for innocence.  The novel's setting additionally relates to the theme.  Several places secure symbolic importance to Holden.  The first of these revealed is the Central Park Lagoon.  Holden ponders the effects of winter.  He wonders if the ducks migrate when the lagoon freezes.  Symbolically, this mirrors Holden's life.  As external factors in his life change, he must choose whether to stay or to \\""migrate\\""himself, running from the problem.    The second symbolic place for Holden, is the Museum of Natural History.  Holden explains the exhibits in the museum.  He notices with a hint of sadness, how those pieces never change, unlike himself, as he claims to feel altered every time.  Here, Holden again explores his growing and maturing as a regrettable happening drawing him from innocence.    The third place discussed, is Holden's old elementary school.  When he attended classes there, he felt sheltered and innocent.  He holds the image of this school as walls of protection surrounding the children attending.  Thus it follows, Holden is enraged by profanity written on the walls of the building.  He is so hurt that the corruption of the world has managed to slip into the school, he takes time to clear the words from the wall.  This action is his symbolic atoning for his sins.  He wishes to \\""clean\\"" himself from his corrupt maturity.         Salinger's writing style is far from conventional.  He uses profanity throughout the novel to clarify his points.  In addition, the use of vulgar language acts as Holden's personal proof of maturity.  This is another symbol of Holden's fear of maturity.  He faces growing with harsh words, superficies covering his desire to stay a child forever.  The Catcher in the Rye is so named for a motif in the novel.  The Robert Burn's song \\""Comin' Thro the Rye\\"" reappears several times for Holden.  The correct lyrics read, \\""...if a body meet a body coming through the rye\\"" but Holden has distorted (once again) the lyrics to read, \\""if a body catch a body coming through the rye.\\""  This line reflects his great sorrow of losing his brother, as he replaces \\""meet\\"" with \\""catch,\\"" the symbol of his brother's catcher's mitt.  It also forms Holden's stated life goal.  \\"". . . I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff--I mean if they're running and they don't look where they'regoing I have to come out from somewhere and catch them.

I hope I'm not speaking too soon, especially since I have Mrs. Dalloway, Zorba the Greek and Swann's Way in my too-read pile.     So why is this book so great? Let's start with sheer writing technique. It's superior. Why? Salinger describes characters without EVER stopping the story. He tends to describe people in traits and ticks, versus describing the person from head to toe with general and forgettable traits you're likely to forget 200 pages later.     Chapters worked on so many levels. Each chapter was thematically rich, and you never knew what that crazy Holden was going to do next. While some might complain about the long paragraphs, they were generally always vivid in imagery.     Salinger is a master of \\""show don't tell.\\"" Sure, he may have said \\""It made me feel depressed\\"" (which, admittedly, doesn't say much,) but then he follows it up with a passage like this:     \\""I went to this very cheap restaurant and had doughnuts and coffee. Only, I didn't eat the doughnuts. I couldn't swallow them too well. The thing is, if you get very depressed about something, it's hard as hell to swallow.\\""    Not only do you get a swift and clear image, but you also identify with what it feels like to be so depressed that you simply lose your appetite. The entire novel is written on this level.     And the book had something to say about the choices you make in life and what it means to face your problems or run away from them.     The Catcher in the Rye is a quiet book. No buildings blowing up and no high-speed car chases.

Was Salinger a perpetual teenager, or was he just remarkably insightful? I do not know the answers to these questions and I never will, but this fact does not bother me. I can find all I need to know about Salinger in his hauntingly autobiographical novel The Catcher in the Rye. His colloquial speech is incredibly relaxing to read. Who said literature always had to be so stiff? He, like James Dean, is often considered to epitomize the true \\""rebel without a cause.\\"" However, with a closer look, it is possible to understand why this young man is as angry as he is.    Holden is like most other teenagers in that he cannot make up his mind. Probably the most dualistic character in all of American literature, he has widely varied opinions on the same subject- this would seem impossible, but Holden (or should I say Salinger?) accomplishes it both realistically and intriguingly. What is most fascinating about Holden is his obsession with innocence, and the protection of childhood. He provokes a fight with his roommate at Pencey because the boy goes on a date with a girl from Holden's childhood- symbolically protecting her innocence. He has a preoccupation with the ducks in Central Park. He continuously asks people if they know where the ducks go during the winter, representing his fixation for all things simple.     The introduction of his younger sister Phoebe brings one of literature's most brilliant characters to light. Salinger managed to create someone who is very clever for her age but is so young that it is not impossible to smile at some of the things she says. It is highly understandable as to why Holden loves his sister so much. In fact, this relationship is what endeared Holden to me. His sensitivity towards his younger sister (when most older brothers antagonize their younger siblings) erases many opinions of him as cynical and rebellious. Thisis not to say that he is not rebellious-he is- but he is so much more than that.     At the crux of the story lies a deeply confused teenager, one who has lost his younger brother and is enduring a midlife crisis at much too young an age. His mind constantly pulls his thoughts in different directions, and it is no wonder that Holden seems stretched too thin. His symbolic desire to be \\""the catcher in the rye\\"", or the person who helps children retain their innocence, draws the reader to the conclusion that Holden is not merely a teenage rebel. He's truly lost in a world that he views as cruel and without the innocence he wishes it had.

Salinger is an American novelist and best known for this very book, The Catcher in the Rye, which is considered a classic of USA's literature, being in Times list of 100 best books since 1923.<br /><br /> This book tells a rather uninteresting story of this sixteen-year-old character Holden Caulfield and his wanders through New York for a couple days, after his expulsion from his boarding school, exposing the real face of teenager's life, in which the main character is also the narrator. What is perhaps more interesting is that he has such a depressed and lonely way of life that it is almost impossible not to have anything in common with this global character, who is supposed to represent the transition from childhood to adult life.<br /><br /> When I started reading this book, I found out that I was addicted to it, even though it had no plot at all. It really doesn't, it's just a dude telling about his life. But it is Holden who you are actually reading. I have never read, in my whole life, such a descriptive and well-developed character. You actually feel that you are reading a teenager's book who has failed in about four schools, not an intellectual like J. D. Salinger. That's probably why the book is so addictive: it's a clean and straightforward writing, which makes it feel real, a very real account. I do have a lot against writers and philosophers who are claimed to be wonderful and swell, but they can't write clearly such as Salinger does. This book may be read by anyone - in fact, it is aimed to teenagers and I do recommend them to read - and anyone who reads this book will understand what it is talking about. Some of them may not like, but they will surely get the least of it.<br /><br /> Holden Caulfield is this teenager that wanders around New York and lives a very teenager life - don't forget this book was written in the 50's - and finds himself in the transition from child to adulthood; facing problems like an adult - and that's probably why Salinger set him alone in NY - but still with a mind of a kid. While he tries to evolve, starts to find out that everybody looks fake and lousy, but he turns out to be a complete hypocrite, which is probably the main purpose of the book.<br /><br /> The title deserves five stars just for itself. Although you read the book until about the middle without getting where the author is trying to get you to, when Holden hears a little boy singing this song about a catcher in the rye - which he actually misspelled -, everything starts making sense. Holden flies through the book trying to find a shoulder to lean on, someone that will hold him while he's passing through his puberty, sexual life and depressing times of adolescence; and that's what he searches, even unaware of what's actually happening.<br /><br /> While he's not getting anything that's valuable from his current relationships - which are represented by his Pencey school and his friends in there -, he goes way back to the innocence of childhood and brings back his old memories and relationships in attempt to survive the hard times that is entering the adulthood. But when he actually gets to those memories, he is not a kid anymore and his mind has changed. In this quest of finding \\""a catcher in the rye\\"", Holden even unburies his dead brother Allie and contacts people who are still in their innocent times - such as his sister - and people who are really in the adulthood, like his old teachers.<br /><br /> This transition is easily seen in every sense. From trying to drink being a minor to a massive change of his views on the world, contrasted by what he remembered things to be and what they reallyare right now. I highly recommend this book to anyone. This is surely one of the best - if not the best - novels I have ever read in my entire life. Although aimed to teenagers, this story is surely universal.<br /><br />100/100This is surely one of the best - if not the best - novels I have ever read in my entire life.

In a moment of personal confusion and conflict, I reread it yet again at about 30, hoping it would renew me in some way.  It had the opposite effect.

I don't get why The Catcher in the Rye is supposed to be this great, amazing, classic. Did it go over my head? Is The Catcher in the Rye really this amazing book that provides insight into teenage alienation? Or is it really just a substandard book? The answer to this question is a matter of opinion. And in my opinion, the first theory is a load of crap.<br /><br />First of all, if Holden was even alienated, it was by his own doing. Everyone was a moron. Everyone and everything was STUPID! Everyone was a phony. Everyone, but Holden himself, of course. Holden was the most real guy that you will ever meet. Or at least he is, according to his delusions. Holden was a hypocrite and the biggest phony in The Catcher in the Rye. He was a pathological liar. Was THIS the point of the book...to show how alienation affects teens so bad that they become flaming hypocrites, and issue-infested liars?<br /><br />Holden Caufield was also bratty and pretentious. His so-called \\""astute\\"" observations were average and typical (were they supposed to be some inner look into the mind of an unapplied genius? Because I so didn't get that) and more often than not kind of boring. His observations also made me roll my eyes quite a bit. And man, was he repetitive! He mentioned the same sentence twice (and even three times) in the same paragraph.<br /><br />So why did I give The Catcher in the Rye two stars instead of the dreaded one? Well, this book was written in a fairly breezy, easy to read style. That's important to me when I'm reading a classic. Sure, it's all fine and dandy to admire the semi-dry writing of the classic writers, but if it takes me a half hour to read a page, some of the pleasure fades. That was the good thing about this book. It was easy to understand. Too bad that my understanding is that this book is a bit overrated. In fact, I understand why it's heralded as the book of the sociopaths. I'm not saying that everyone who enjoys the book is a sociopath, but I can see why sociopaths love it.ths love it.",2011-01-29

I can relate to having poor grades like him and his whining, to a certain point, feels justifible. To me, he felt 3D and was very funny. I could completely relate to Holden in that he did not want to give up the innocence of childhood.

Holden shares many of his life struggles through this book and some of us may have gone through them or know someone that has. That is what makes this book very relatable.  Holden's brother is dead, he failed out of one school and now is in a prep school where he believes that everyone is phony.

And just like the protagonist himself - I dont even know what the hell to think about the goddamn book. I really don't.<br />As Holden begins his tale, apparently from a hospital of some sort, he takes us back to the recent past where he is struggling in every possible way as a high school student at Percy Prep ( A high - end sleep away school in Agerstown PA.) From there, the book is just one long Goddamn story Holden conveys to us, which includes encounters with teachers, peers, and other random people as he gets kicked out of Percy and returs to his home town: New Yory City.<br />As I am reading about Holdens escapades, I start to feel as if I know him... well. Holden's story is shared with us - the readers - in a very conversationsl style; as If Holden and I were sitting in a coffee shop somewhere and he was simply filling me in on the last 12 months of his life. And I find myself relating to his story in two distinct ways:<br />First, it is obvious that he is in that akward stage that occurs somewhere between childhood and adulthood - terribly frusturated with everyone and everything, struggling to make sense of all that is happening around him. I too suffered through that stage and probobly would have connected with the charachter on an even deeper level had I read the classic back then.<br />Second, I am appreciating the descriptive and revealing sights and sounds of New York City, having been raised in Queens, spending much time in NYC growing up.<br />As this fairly ammusing story prgresses, I find myself \\"" rooting for Holden\\"" - hoping that at the end he will become \\""enlightened\\"", turn a corner, get his act together.<br />Ultiamtely, I find myself wanting more - wanting to know how my friend Holden turns out.

Holden Caulfield, the main character, has trouble staying in school without being expelled. He went from school to school, unsuccessful at each one. At his latest prep school, Pencey Prep, he has an annoying, self-centered roommate who prioritizes his social life above all else. With no roommate to support him, Holden felt he had nobody to talk to that understood him. He finally got kicked out, due to his lack of motivation which led him to receive bad grades. He decided to leave Pencey Prep earlier than they expected him to and to stay in his home city of New York for awhile. It is in New York that Holden experiences situations that change his life. Despite his high level of independence, Holden's desperation for companionship is taking over him. He shows this by calling a stranger at midnight with the hopes of interacting with someone. He is also trying to flirt with older ladies at a bar. You have to read the book to find out exactly what he goes through.

It's like page after page after page...of absolutely nothing.  And at the end of it all, there is no pay off.  There is no conclusion to the story.  Don't hope for one; it is not there.<br /><br />Holden Caulfield gets kicked out of school (again), but he doesn't do anything amazing with his time, except wander around for a weekend.  He gets drunk, but he never really has much fun doing it.  He picks up with a prostitute, but he gets no action.  His creepy room mate dates his childhood friend, but nothing whatsoever comes of that either.  His teacher cops a feel on him in the middle of the night, but the one he gets is really pretty silly to read about.  He gets slapped around some, but never gets the stuffing knocked out of him, nor any sense knocked in.  He gets sick toward the end, but he's not suffering from anything major.  And after 200 pages of terror over what his parents will think, you never actually hear what they have to say.  All the reader knows is, Holden's intelligence is upstaged by a 10 year old.  Worst of all, after all of this whining & carrying on...  Holden doesn't come to any important new realizations about life, himself, or anyone else.<br /><br />The realization I came to on the final page, is that just because a piece of writing is referred to as \\""a classic\\"", that does not mean it is particularly well written, or profoundly meaningful.

From Homer to Dostoyevsky to Sartre, I love it all, including modern classics.  Naturally, that this book is counted among the modern classics, as well as its association with the assassination of John Lennon, both recommended this book for my reading list.  I read it first when I was 17 years old, and again recently at 22.  Frankly, I have never quite understood its place on the list of classics as it is often described.  Sometimes I think that the only reason it is so popular is because it was banned in many places, in the same way that Ulysses (which I would count as a classic, personally) is so often counted among the Classics by people who have never read it.  I'm not a fuddy-duddy or a stuffy classicist: I absolutely adore books with no plot, interesting first-person narration, quirky characters, etc.  But I just don't quite \\""get it\\"", and I never have.

He is whiny and foul-mouthed, and uses the words \\""phony\\"" and \\""god****\\"" every other paragraph.  I am not criticizing Salinger's writing--in fact, it's dead on.  I had no difficulty whatsoever believing that this was really written by a teenage boy.  But it just doesn't ring any bells, or flip any switches, for me.  It's okay, and not a bad read on a lazy afternoon, but beyond that it falls flat.

The main character sort of lives his days, doing stupid things and fretting about them. I found that very charming.  - The silly teenage language from the late 40'es / early 50'es. It annoyed me at first, but then I enjoyed it.  - The whiny narrative. Yep, it was a bit over the top whiny; but I thought it was compensated by the inspired passages that were observant and kind. In fact, the narrative left me feeling the guy may have loved the people he claimed to 'hate'.  - The repetitiveness of some key themes and thoughts. I found it very natural.    Separately, the characterization was breathtaking, I thought.

This certainly isn't on the level of Huck Finn, To Kill A Mockingbird, Life of Pi, nor even The Tale Of Depereaux, but it is different than anything else I've read.  Perhaps the appeal of this book is that it's written from the perspective of  a teenager, in stylized teenaged writing, about teenaged issues.  This could be one of those books that appeals more to a specific audience of those going through puberty than it does to the general reader.  Still, Holden Caulfield seems like more of a whiner than a cynical adolescent to me.    Reading this book is like being stuck in an elevator with a sixteen year old boy for the duration.  It might make for a good psychological study of that particular insanity that teenagers go through as their brains develop in the presence of an overdose of hormones, but as a story it lacks a plot.  This is about a kid wandering aimlessly through his life, such as it is, both literally and existentially.  It could theoretically give aid and comfort to those teens in a similar situation, but I can't imagine it helping me much when I was that age.  The main character is supposed to be a young radical, smoking and drinking despite being underage, but it all seems much too tame in these modern times.    I suppose that the moral of the story is supposed to be that everyone undergoes these psychotic teenage episodes, even the preppies.  However, this point is made in a monotonous, rather repetitious and boring manner as our young angster wanders about NYC looking to rutt, having just been kicked out of yet another fancy boarding school.  If the rich kids have these same problems then maybe we should all stop feeling sorry for ourselves and think about poor Richard Cory.  It's all just a little too ham-handed for me and it really bothers those kids who really were cool and all to have to listen to those who just think they are.

I suppose it's possible that the book wanted me to kill both of them but if that's the case then why not simply state it outright, instead of leaving it up to interpretation like it did?   Furthermore, now that both the people that the book instructs on killing are dead, it seems a little dated. Sure, it can be read as a coming-of-age-tale, but to do that you must read between the lines. I tried calling Mr. Salinger to have him clear it all up, but he wouldn't answer. It turns out that in an effort to become even more reclusive, he's died.  My favorite quotation from the book: \\""Kill John Lennon. Go ahead, you know you want to.

I though this character reminds me of me sometimes. What he thinks and what he does can be completely different things.    I thought this book was really good. The beginning is a little bit slow but Salinger really must have targeted the teen audience. Though a lot of people think this book should be read by college students, I think anyone in high or even upper middle school would be able to relate.    It makes me wonder what happens to Holden Caufield. I think his experience wandering around New York alone would help him learn that the world doesn't revolve around him. As a teen I have to admit that at most time I think the same way. I think that Holden has a lot of potential and that he could live up to it if he really strived to.

The protagonist is a misfit, is at the brink of his adulthood, senses he is about to lose something unique as he leaves his childhood world for good but is not sure what and flails wildly in his attempt to grasp what life is about.  I started off disliking the book:  the language, the events happening to him, his reactions to those events.  But before I reached half-way through the book, I felt sorry for the boy, who came across as sensitive and scared.  Three-quarter of the book, I worried for him and wondered if there's light at the end of his tunnel.  By the time I finished reading the book, I thought it a tale told by an idiot, full of sound of fury.  Of course it does not compare with Macbeth or Hamlet, but it is none the less a tragically realistic story, touchingly told by an honest and eloquent idiot. (It does remind me of Mark Haddon's THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME, except the ailment here is depression and not autism.  So if you like THE CURIOUS INCIDENT, you will probably like THE CATCHER.)    I think it is a good story told by a good story-teller.  It is both a period piece and timeless:   Deciphering the American slangs in vogue during that time period has slowed down my reading quite a bit, yet the story is one that can, and probably does, happen in any country through out history.

Salinger is a powerful novel chronicling the life of an upper class teenage boy, Holden Caulfield during the early 1950's. Around this time, more and more people were conforming to society, dressing the same, acting the same, and through Holden, Salinger challenges those ideals. The book opens when Holden is expelled from yet another boarding school, because of his awful grades. He finds the world around him to be fake, and those people who demand him to conform to be phonies, not true to themselves. He sets off for New York City on his own, in a journey of self-exploration where he learns about love, life, and sex. As a troubled youth, he is a constant pessimist about the world around him, seeing it to be a mass conformist nation, without any true individuals, except for himself of course. His early life is troubled, and his younger brother's death shook him badly, and effected him deeply. Some of the pessimism comes from his older brother, a writer who in Holden's opinion became a prostitute for Hollywood, abandoning his own writing to work for the movies, selling out in the worst way.His parents seem vastly absent in the novel, perhaps suggesting that his parents are not role models for him, and while they may love him, they do not truly understand him. Without this adult guidance he mistrusts the adult world, a cynical view which pervades the whole book. This kind of teenage rebellion is something that the youth of today can easily relate to. Holden himself is an easily relatable character, and modern teens will find something of his character similar in themselves, whether that's his cynicism, or his constant thoughts about sex. He is confused by sex, but still finds it intriguing, and of course wants very badly to experience it. He goes on a date, with an old friend, and while he tries very badly to be charming, he cannot stand how absolutely fake he feels she is, and this leaves him disappointed with the world in general. In the end, he finds that while the world disappoints him, there is still good in it, and while he wanted very much to be away from people when he was with them he wanted them back once he had to live without them. This poignant tale of an adolescent growing up on his own in a world he despises is a must-read, one that can change one's views on the world, and on life. It teaches the importance of individuality, a love of beauty in all it's forms, and of one youth's perception of the world around us.",2010-06-16

Holden Caulfield, the protagonist of J.D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye taking place in New York in the 1950's, is no different. He decides that he has to \\""catch everybody if they start to go over a cliff - I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them.

Holden is in the process of transitioning into adulthood; however, he wants to preserve his childhood innocence. He watched as his brother Allie died of leukemia at a young age and can't bear to think of anyone else missing out on the virtues of childhood. He wants to protect his sister Phoebe from the evil adult world as he encourages her to ride the carousel. Holden himself attempts to venture into society, but can never seem to manage. Going out late at night, drinking, and getting involved with prostitutes are things that Holden tries to do to make the difficult transition. However, Holden faces many internal conflicts that prevent him from entering adulthood. He has flunked out of four preparatory schools and feels abandoned by his parents because he knows they will just send him off to another one without trying to understand the problem. Holden continues to search for his identity, and an answer to where the ducks go when the lagoon in Central Park freezes. All readers will be able to relate to Holden's frustrations, disappointments, thoughts, and decisions. He proves himself to be complex, sharing the mentality of teenagers today. The audience can connect to Holden's feelings of isolation and fear of growing up. The theme of Salinger's book is timeless because Holden's concerns match those of teenagers everywhere in every era. The Catcher in the Rye is a classic that is truly deserving ofpraise. It is a book in which the reader can't help but connect to the main character.

Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. The story is a monologue of Caulfield's existence in a privileged society filled with \\""phonies\\"" during the 1950s in New York City.  Caulfield's parents send him away to boarding school, which does not alter his cynical attitude towards life and prompts him to be extremely apathetic and fail out of multiple schools until he lands at Pencey Prep, where the story begins. The reader discovers that Caulfield is actually very troubled because of the death of his younger brother, which affects his attitude towards life causing him to disregard a life of affluence and conclude that it is empty, providing no comfort, as many believe money can. At one point in the story, Caulfield expresses that money, \\""...always ends up making you blue as hell\\"" (133). After being expelled from Pencey Prep, for failing every class except English, he decides to venture into New York City before the letter detailing his expulsion reaches his parents. Caulfield embarks on a journey in search of what is missing in his life and what will ease his depressed state. Masking his feelings behind sarcasm and witty banter, Caulfield reaches desperation, as he stays awake night and day, drowning in his own misery while in search of what will make his life better.   This novel is brilliantly composed by Salinger, who examines the life of a teenager who feels lost and trapped inside an empty world. Whether it is his compulsive spending, apathy towards school, or even confusion with the opposite sex, Caulfield is a character that is so real, the reader feels as if he is a troubled friend who is in need of help. Because of his character and the conflicts he faces, Caulfield makes The Catcher in the Rye a timeless masterpiece. In an increasingly material world, the troubles of money and the search for what will bring true happiness is a more relevant theme than ever. Adolescents will always find comfort in knowing that Caulfield felt the same feelings of being ignored or invisible while also enormously pressured to conform to what is acceptable and leave a life of simplicity and innocence, and enter the world of adulthood.",2010-06-15

As Holden encounters difficulties with roommates, relatives, and relationships, teenage readers can connect to his problems and understand his feelings and desire to remain young.  He shares the confusions of sex, love, and overall morality, unable to understand what is right.   Although some argue that the language of the novel is too harsh, profane, and perhaps unnecessary; it is through this tone that young readers relate.  This abrasive dialogue helps to show that Holden is not some perfect prep school kid but an everyday teen who makes mistakes and fears what the future may hold.  At first he seems to have a tough and almost rebel-like exterior, but as readers learn of his close relationship to his little sister Phoebe and the pain he feels concerning the death of his brother, it becomes evident that underneath the façade is a caring and loving heart.         A truly timeless work of literature, Holden and his dilemmas are a model for many.

Salinger's The Catcher in The Rye is a controversial piece of literature, from the moment the novel is open, until the book's back cover is closed. Salinger's use of profanity and coverage of mature material has been debated for years. Some claim it to be too blunt and inappropriate for its targeted audience, but regardless of these critics' opinions, Salinger's brilliance is undeniable. The novel's protagonist, Holden Caulfield, is a seventeen year old prep school teen who constantly suppresses his past which causes interference with his present life. With the plot set, the novel easily establishes a theme in which many can relate to, the inevitable loss of innocence one undergoes when growing up. This theme seems to prevail, and bring truth to the unavoidable facades adults often wear. J.D. Salinger's informal use of language, and well developed characters help capture the ingenious plot of his novel and its ability to have its audience clinging to every page.       The Catcher in the Rye ultimately portrays Holden Caulfield's fear of becoming another phony adult in society. His many teenage problems that uniquely present themselves throughout his life, create a page-turning effect that keeps the reader anticipating what the next may reveal. While Holden's attitude and personality seem to embody every reader who praises this novel, the supporting characters don't always play such a minimal role. Holden's older brother, and younger sister, Phoebe plays a large part in the development of Holden's character. Events such as the death of his little brother, in the long run also reveals much about Holden's attitude on life. His close relationship with his sister and the envious resentment he occasionally portrays for his older brother, are relationships everyone can relate to.      Salinger's simple use of language leaves no space for confusion, and his bluntness enables The Catcher in the Rye's audience to relate in such a close manner. His informal usage of words are also responsible for attracting readers who long to pick up a book without having to put on their \\""SAT\\"" thinking-caps in order to acquire a new perspective on teenage life. But without a doubt, depending on the reader's level of comprehension, Salinger does provide bigger ideas and concepts for deeper analysis through his \\""simple use of language\\"". The popularity of this book has remained consistent throughout the years, from being one of the top \\""must read\\"" novels, to being the talk in every high school English room, The Catcher in the Rye is one of the most brilliant and life changing novels yet.

From the very begginning of the book until the very last words, I could connect with this mysterious character Salinger created.  Although Holden was quite hard to figure out, he stil had a very strong sense of humor.  With a smart-alec tone to his thoughts you gradually find out his past and his present.  In the entire book you embark on a journey to uncover Holden's true self.  In Holden's mind you go through the same typical midlife crisis a teen would.   This was a very good book and deserves a spot on the bookshelf next to the Harry Potter series.  I advise anyone of any age to read this book and think whats beyond the words.  People have interpreted this in so many ways and theres no entirely correct way.  Great Job, Salinger.  Tweedyyy :))",2010-04-19

I should also say that as frustrating as it is to get inside the mind of Holden Caulfield, I came away from the book with a sense of hope, that maybe the kid won't be a schmuck for the rest of his life after all.

Maybe because at that point in my life I was into bucking authority so some extent and, ironically much like the main character Holden Caulfield didn't much like school. Now much later in life I decided to read it again to see why this book is still so popular nearly 60 years after it's release.<br /><br />Salinger was in his late twenties and early thirties when he wrote this book however it's written like a teenager at the time might talk in terms of phrases, sentence structure, though processes etc,. and it's very well written in that respect. It captures the angst and anger of youth, being somewhere between a boy and a man, wanting to be an adult but still having to rely on adults to a certain extent who are making decisions for you that you don't necessarily agree with. This is the life of the books main character Holden Caulfield. Having re read the book I get it now. The story and emotions seemed familiar probably because I could reconcile it to my teenage years. I found Holden Caulfield to be fairly unlikable at times, he thought everything and almost everyone was dumb and then I wondered to myself was that peoples perception of me at times in my youth? At times inn my youth  I was like Holden Caulfield in some ways. The last chapter of the book is Holden Caulfield reflecting on his youth . It really brought the book full circle and gives the reader a sense of Holden Caulfield the man being reflective on his youth.<br /><br />The writing style in interesting because it's written like someone is sitting with you telling a story keeping you involved in the conversation by using phrases like \\""I told you about that earlier\\"" It's writing in a one way conversational style.<br /><br />Some of  the phrases used in the book are a little Leave it to Beaverish by today's standards.

Salinger    Pages: 214    Time spent on the \\""to read\\"" shelf: 4 or 5 months I think.    Days spent reading it:  4 days.    Why I read it:  The Catcher in the Rye is an American classic and very controversial.  I honestly wanted to see what was so controversial.  Also, it was one of those \\""classics\\"" that I did not read while in high school.  In researching about it later I read that in 1981 it was the most censored book in US high schools and the second most taught book in high schools.  It was one of the 10 most challenged books in 2005, but it came off the list in 2006. Those are some fun facts for you.    Brief review:    This book frankly annoyed me.  The writing has very repetitive and had many aggravating sayings in it.  The word \\""really\\"" is used almost as much as the curse words that are prevalent throughout the book (one reason it is often censored--I would guess that gd appears 2-3 times a page at minimum, sometimes significantly more).  And I assure you, both appear more than they need to, I really mean it.      Holden Caulfield is the main character.  He is the epitome of teenage angst.  His world is utterly pessimistic.  He sees only the bad in everything except his sister and his deceased younger brother.  He is bright, but is failing out of school.  He is obsessed with sex, but cannot develop a relationship with a girl.  He is active and pursues all the pleasure trappings that a big city have, but has no defining meaning to his life.      The book covers three days between him being kicked out of school and his untimely return home.  Holden is depressed, hates everyone, exaggerates EVERYTHING (annoyingly so), and seems to have few people skills.  In short, he is the perfect anti-hero and irritating enough that I did not like him one bit while reading this book.    I suppose this book speaks to the hearts of some disaffected youth, but they would have to be interested in drudging through 200 pages of dribble in orderto find the voice that Holden ultimately gives them.      I found little redeeming quality in this book.  I felt like I was being attacked as a reader throughout the book.  The curse words were prevalent.  Holden's judgmental attitude and disquieting assessment that everyone was fake simply unnerved me.  The last 20 pages or so bring a little clarity to the book, but even that is not satisfying.  I read this article in wikipedia and found a little more clarity on the book, but not enough to ever allow me to suggest this to a friend.  I understand why people have tried to censor it (and sympathize with them even if I disagree with them), but honestly if it was not so controversial I think few people would ever pick it up and think \\""Hey, that's a great book!  Everyone should read this.\\""      In short, I'm glad I am not Holden Caulfield.  I respect those who relate to him and his story, but his life is from such a different perspective from mine that I never sympathized with the character and ultimately never connect to the book.    Oddly, in reflecting on the book some--the tone, the overall message, the anxiety it produced in me, perhaps I give J.D. Salinger too little credit.  He probably got the exact response that he wanted out of me.  I hate it when that happens.  This is probably one of those books you mull over for a long time and never really like it, because its not fun.  But you can respect it because of the emotions and conflict it produces in the reader.  How interesting--actually reviewing the book in writing has changed my mind regarding my final critique of the book.    Favorite quote: \\""Girls.

The main character, Holden Caulfied, is a troubled teen that is yet again, expelled from another haughty boarding school. Holden cannot find the motivation to succeed in school because he feels he does not have a purpose. Why apply yourself if you don't know your place in life? Holden struggles with his inner-self, battling his own mind, and trying to understand his purpose in life as a teenage boy. Holden's difficulty in comprehending his place in the world as a young boy is what makes this story unviversally relatable.     After Holden is asked to leave Pencey High School after winter break [expelled], Holden ditches school early to take a little \\""vacation\\"" to New York City; he packs and leaves by train in the hopes of enjoying himself before returning home to his parent's wrath. In the few days he spends in New York , he experiences the city's nightlife through strippers, bars, and night clubs. In contrast, he also spends his free time by revisiting his childhood, reuniting himself with old friends and visiting sentimental places. Holden seems to have a lot of friends, although it is obvious he is not confident about friendships. Holden degradingly numbers off girls throughout the story and therefore his character becomes bothersome. However most of the time it is very easy to sympathize for Holden as he is in deep distress, and he feels that he is surrounded by a bunch of \\""phonies\\"". No matter who he associates himself with, whether it is an old friend or a stripper, he feels out of place. The more Holden observes and aquaints himself with humankind in New York City, the more he realizes he is different, and the more he feel like he is without purpose. His inner-struggles and battling of the mind eventually peaks causing for a catchy ending. However, the author does not fill the ending with detail and it can be very frusterating.    Over all, this book was easy to relate to, it was funny, and it was happy and sad all at the same time. Salinger's writing is humorous...but it is not forced humor. He often incorporated spontaneous wit, humor that is not necessarily \\""obvious\\"". For example, the laughter that come from dealing with an awkward roomate. The struggles that Holden Caulfield went through could be applied to anyone's life as a high school student, and being able to follow Holden through his journey of discovery makes this book relevant and dear to any reader's heart.",2010-02-12

My guess is Salinger had a issue with authority figures all his life and let it all out in this book.  I can say that I have read it so I can at least discuss it with others but I got no insite into my life from it and neither did Holden by the way.

In any case, about 6 years later I found myself alone and stranded in the Australian outback with absolutely nothing to do and nothing to read except a box of books that included most of the works by Mark Twain, John Steinbeck, Kurt Vonnegut and this one by Salinger.  It was the first time in my life that I had ever delved into literature in any real way and I totally fell in love with Twain and Steinbeck and especially Vonnegut.  But when it came to this Salinger thing, I couldn't believe how boring it was, how irrelevant it seemed, how utterly phony its angsty rebelliousness seemed to be.  I had grown up around tough kids who lived difficult lives when I was a kid and in Australia I had been working with roughnecks in the oil business, so this Salinger thing seemed pathetically trivial to me and its fame remained totally baffling to me.  So about 8 years after that, I thought maybe I had missed something on the first read, so I read it again.  And then I tried to re-read it for a third time about 5 years after that, but the effect was always the same.  You call this angst?  You're telling me this is what rebellion feels like?  I can only think that my English teacher and all those other teachers who think this is somehow profound really haven't had much of a life, haven't really plunged too far into the depths of human experience, haven't really had to face difficult questions about existence and so forth.  I'm sorry, but it's just a boring book.  And if you're a teenager and your teachers are cramming this down your throat and you don't get it no matter how hard you try, don't sweat it: you're not alone.  Maybe this was mind-blowing stuff 60 years ago, but 25 years ago I thought it was just an over-hyped waste of time... and I still do.

Salinger's passing. Simon was going to school at Dartmouth, near where Salinger lived in New Hampshire, and he really wanted to meet the writer. He managed to get as far as the great man's front door, before being turned away by a girlfriend. In response to the short blog entry, I noted that I've read many books, but never The Catcher in the Rye, for whatever reason. Every time someone tries to explain the book and why it resonated with them, I just get annoyed. It makes me want to read the book less.    So I commented on Roger's blog article, and joked that I'd probably prefer a Pastrami in the Rye to The Catcher in the Rye. I have a thing for Langer's. Anyway, Roger then wondered if anyone had read Catcher recently, or wanted to now having not read it in the past. A few days later I when I was out and about, I idly went to a used bookstore, discovered they were out, went to a second one ditto, and wound up buying one of the few copies left at the local Borders. It's been a couple of days, and now I've read the thing. It wasn't at all what I expected, and I didn't relate to Holden at all...but I still think it's a brilliant book, just not for the reasons that everyone else (or those I've read, anyway) seem to think it's great.    For those of you familiar with music, Randy Newman is probably best known for the song \\""Short People.\\"" It's about prejudice and how stupid prejudiced people are. Newman famously has gotten sick of various lunkheads yelling \\""Hey Randy, short people suck!\\"" at him randomly on the street. He deliberately chose a characteristic that would be beyond prejudice, even semi-intelligent prejudice, and found that people were much more stupid than he thought, and that the song, as a result, resonated with a lot of people it wasn't supposed to.    With The Catcher in the Rye, I get the same impression. I don't think this was supposed to resonate with anyone. If I understand it correctly, the book was written for adults, and only after a good long while was it assigned to children. It resonates with teenagers in many ways, because a lot of kids when they're that age feel aimless and alienated. The problem with taking the book literally is that *no one* at least as far as I'm concerned was ever as alienated as Holden Caulfield. It's as if Salinger wanted to exaggerate the unattractive qualities of this kid, with the intention of making a main character so objectionable that no one could like him or take his story seriously, and everyone would get the message that this sort of alienated behavior is beyond the pale. No wonder the guy exiled himself for 50 years. No one understood his book...either that, or I misread it completely.    So, for those of you who haven't read the book, this is a synopsis of the plot, though it's mostly a synopsis of the main character because there is no plot. Our hero, or anti-hero really, is Holden Caulfield. He comes from a well-to-do family (at one point he mentions his father's a corporate lawyer, they have an apartment that's half of a floor in a building next to Central Park, he has a grandmother who sends him lots of money for his birthday, etc.) and he's just been kicked out of his third prep school. He left one (because everyone there was a phony; one of his bugaboos is he hates phonies) and was kicked out of the other. This one is called Pencey, and Holden has been kicked out because he just ditched most of the classes and did none of the homework. So he goes back to New York City for the weekend, and just aimlessly horses around for the whole book. At the beginning, when he's telling you what is going to happen, he says he'll tell you about the \\""madman\\"" weekend he had. You get the feeling that the character's supposed to have written this account as therapy, to try and sort out why he did what he did.    The weekend itself is unremarkable, except for Holden making an ass of himself repeatedly. He goes to various bars and restaurants and tries to order liquor, which he shouldn't be served because of his age. If he gets it he gets drunk and sits there getting annoyed with the people around him in the bar, and silly things about them that irritate him. If they don't serve him alcohol he does the same thing, only he doesn't get drunk doing it. Holden's hyper-critical about everything around him, and spends pages telling you about how he can't stand phonies (almost everyone he mentions in the book is a phony in some respect) and he hates *things*. One of the more annoying (and recognizable) traits of Holden-the-teenager is that he is constantly trying to convince you he's an old hand at things. He repeatedly refers to \\""when I was a kid\\"" and is always telling you that he \\""always\\"" does something in such-and-such a circumstance, as if he's been doing this or that for decades. He's the sort of teenager who earnestly tells adults he's very mature...and of course isn't mature at all.    So why did I give this novel five stars? It's brilliantly written. The author adopts Holden's voice and uses it as his own--never breaks character no matter what--for 214 pages. You believe that this little self-important self-absorbed twit is actually writing this book, telling you about what an ass he was during this weekend. I'd always thought that this book was to be taken as the classic coming of age story, but of course Holden doesn't come of age during the course of the book, at all. At most, he gets a little sense smacked into him (figuratively) when he announces to his little sister that he's running away, and she decides to come with him. Holden instead is shipped out to Hollywood, where his older brother D.B. is a screenwriter (who Holden predictably thinks sold out). D.B. keeps watch on him, while he's here in California. Holden the narrator isn't clear about what's going on, but it sounds like his parents sent him to some sort of sanitarium or something, perhaps to help him get his head straight, and he's written this account while there.    I guess what I'm trying to say is this: The Catcher in the Rye is about how screwed up and alienated a kid can be, except the author exaggerated the characteristics past all reality to make his point more forcefully. To my mind, the book is sort of a cautionary tale. If you spend your whole teenage years criticizing everyone and everything around you, you could wind up like this. It's not a pretty picture, though at times the book is very funny.    I have to say then that I'm appalled that this book is taught in high schools as if it's somehow something that teenagers *should* relate to. They shouldn't relate to it, and no one should aspire to he like Holden Caulfield in the least. This book should be read by adults, those who have gotten far enough along in life that they can safely look back at their adolescence and realize what a jerk they were being when they did various things that seemed important at the time. *Then* you might get something out of it, and you'll certainly get a laugh or three.",2010-02-03

First, I loved the voice in which it was written. Holden is sarcastic, snotty, and just way too cool for almost everything -- just like I was when I was 17. I loved the exaggerations and hyperbole. I identified with his descent into near-madness, being in that awkward stage between childhood and adulthood, not knowing what to do, not really understanding or not wanting to deal with the consequences of your actions, really just not being ready to grow up. As Holden wanders New York in a sleep-deprived stupor, he explores these issues within his mind; he jumps from one feeling to another, and breaks down and cries more than once. It truly is a powerful novel, and one of the three best I've ever read. Five stars all the way.<br /><br />The book is just 214 pages and a breeze to read. If you haven't read it, you should.

But most of students in the class  considered Holden a whiny freak without realizing that often, it's the whiny freaks who walk through life with the clarity of sight and earnestness needed to leave this existence a little better than it was when we entered it.  The story itself is a masterpiece.  Salinger was firing on all cylinders and tapping into the strange other-worldly literary omnipotence we usually attribute to Shakespeare when he wrote Catcher.

To many people, it seems like the typical \\""teenage angst\\"" kind of book, and it's very easy to think that the whole way through the book. If you learn nothing from this book then you didn't get the meaning behind it - it's a blunt statement, either you agree or you don't. And if you *do* get the meaning behind it, but found it to be boring or repetitive anyway, then that is your opinion. Some people just simply don't like the same books.<br /><br />I have to admit, when I first started reading Catcher in the Rye I was a bit struck at why it was considered a classic in literature. With me, I started seeing something deeper when I got to the middle of the book. It isn't until you start seeing the same things being repeated that you start to notice. The title of my review is a great example. Holden Caulfield is a prime example of questioning youth. Most teenagers aren't focused on morals, nor do many of them think deeply about what goes on in the world. And the few that do are like Holden; they're confused, lonely, and scared as hell. So the more I read and the deeper I delved into the meanings behind Holden's thoughts and ideas, the more I began to understand. Holden Caulfield isn't just the average 16-year old. He is, yet he isn't. He *thinks* deeper than the average teenager. He's still immature in a lot of his thinking throughout the book but overall his character is just this mass of confusion. He seems confused at a lot of things, at why a lot of people are the way they are, yet he himself isn't perfect. That is what shapes his character. He isn't flawless, and the author, Salinger, clearly brings that out to the reader. Sometimes Holden contradicts himself - a flaw within himself that is telling the readers that he is human. By developing his character in this way, I saw it as a way to make you both like and dislike him. If you liked him too much, you'd have sympathy for him, but if you disliked him enough too, it evens out to where you really just don't feel bad for him. Rather, you're just following along with him. If I felt any kind of sympathy for Holden throughout the book it was when he tried to talk about things but no one seemed to understand where he was coming from, or what he was talking about. With Holden, what he said didn't have to understand. He just wanted to talk. And he never really felt like he was listened to. This is evident every single time he gives a waiter or waitress a message for a musician playing - \\""People never give your message to anybody\\"". Holden not only is insecure about people not delivering his messages, he *knows* that people won't deliver them. And that is why I feel like Holden repeats a lot of sentences in the book. I feel like the author wanted Holden to keep repeating things, even when he was going \\""I mean..\\"" because Holden never felt like anyone listened to him to begin with. If he doesn't think waiters or any of the people he talked with listened to him then why would he think his readers would listen to?<br /><br />One of the things that I noticed, that really brought out an important issue for today, is how neglected Holden seemed to be. The whole time you're reading the book, it's easily clear to see that Holden just wants someone to talk to. The first example was with Ackley, and then with Stradlater, the woman on the subway, to Faith Cavendish, to the three women at the hotel, to cab drivers, to the prostitute, to the nuns, to Sally, to Luce, to his sister Phoebe, and to Mr. Antolini. And the only time that Holden ever felt that anyone was listening to him was when he talked with Antolini. The way that I took it, by the time he had finally gotten to Antolini, he was so burned out and tired from everything - drinking, poor rest, getting sick - but I also felt that he was finally give out mentally too. It's obvious that Holden was tired of the life that is \\""expected\\"" of humans, of adults, and wanted to find his own way, but people kept pointing out how important things like school really were. When you're a teenager you feel that way, and when others don't listen to you or try to understand, the whole world comes crashing down on you. I can understand why some readers would say that Holden is just another \\""whiny, rich kid\\"" but even \\""wealthy\\"" people can have a hard time, mentally. The thing is, BECAUSE he such a well off kid helps this story flow. Because it isn't told from a poor person's point of view, or someone who is considered dumb. It's told from a teenager's point of view that, though he may be well off, is still struggling with the same exact problems that we all face sometime in our life. With Holden, he experienced it when he was young, and that's why this story is so important to society. Because many teenagers still continue to feel this way, and it's up to us to make them feel important and worth something. Another thing I noticed was that Holden is a very anxious person, and he is easily bothered by the smallest gesture if it is given by the same sex. This was the case with Mr. Antolini. Holden literally freaked out and left his house when he woke up to feeling his old teacher's hand on his head. I don't blame him for leaving either, but this tells us something about Holden's character. That he really is \\""yellow\\"" and that he is quite anxious when it comes to people rubbing him the wrong way.<br /><br />What I walked away from this book thinking was this: As humans, we seem to be in such a hurry for everything. That we focus so much on media and entertainment and trying to impress others, that we miss the bigger picture, and that's life. We forget that there are others who need help, others that just want to talk, to not be lonely, how Holden was, how a lot of people are. The great thing about this story, is everyone can come away with a slightly different interpretation. For me, it's about direction, it's about finding yourself. It's about helping others, it's about a cry for attention. I think Holden said it best in my favorite part of the book, when he was telling his sister Phoebe about what he wanted to do in life - \\""I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all..and I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff..I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff..that's what I'd do all day..I'd just be the catcher in the rye..\\"".is \\""expected\\"" of humans, of adults, and wanted to find his own way, but people kept pointing out how important things like school really were.

Holden Caufield's confusions and frustrations are those of most teenagers who want to connect with other people and belong to a certain social quota. J.D Salinger presents to us a novel full of symbolism, imagery, and adolescent complexity that fufills it's overall goals of giving us a glimpse into the life and psyche of a troubled and disturbed teenager who tries making connections with people he doesn't know ending up in, as mean as this may sound, humorous failed attempts. The overall theme in this novel doesn't comply any moral as did Ovid's fables back in ancient Greece. Catcher in the Rye tends to be more interpretive in that manner. Holden's inability to truly connect with people is due to his inability to immature and let go of pain.   \\""People never notice anything\\"" (Pg 9). It's in this quote that we really see what type of person Holden really is. Nobody around Holden seems to understand him, seems to understand his angers and confusions. Everyone is just as about as \\""phony as he is\\"". It's in these beginning chapters we notice that something is wrong with Holden. something that doesn't quite match up. He's a white male with well-off parents that can afford to send him off to boarding school and he purposefully flunks out by not even attempting to study.

Holden is a pathological lawyer, he smokes like crazy, and he prefers the peak of his brand-new red hunting cap to be facing backward, not forward. Holden begins wandering around New York City, buying time before the date comes when his parents will be expecting him.    Such are the plot details, and the wonderful character painting, that this wonderful little novel unveils early in its course. The Catcher is a fast-paced and an easy read, two qualities which typically don't go along with works of literature. Is the Catcher a work of literature? The answer is an unqualified yes. Salinger has accomplished an amazing feat by relaying his story through the first-person narrative of our protagonist, and the writing is complete with Holden's idiosyncratic jargon and constant lacings of profanity. Yet what makes the writing so remarkable is that we know exactly what Holden is talking about it, even though his slang can be a little confusing at times.    Still, what makes this little gem a literary genius is not its exceptional writing, but its wide appealing cultural value. I think it would be immature and cliched to call this a \\""coming of age\\"" book (even though it is one), or to talk about Holden's prototypical \\""teenage angst\\"". In my opinion, this novel finds its far-reaching appeal because it speaks to the heart of us all. We all get discouraged (and even disgusted) by the faults that we see in society, and in human nature in general (for example, the \\""phoniness\\"" which Holden sees as near ubiquitous). Nevertheless, all of us have to make decisions, just like Holden does, as to what direction we choose to walk in life.    A final note. I loved this book and found myself laughing out loud throughout many parts of the book. Nonetheless, I wouldn't be surprised if this novel isn't everyone's cup of tea. I suspect that some readers will have a tough time relating to some of Holden's observations (after all, those \\""phonies\\"" that Holden constantly criticizes include us). In addition, Holden's cynical, near sourpuss attitude (along with his profanity) may be a turn-off to some. I still suggest that you at least give this novel a try.",2009-11-07

While I do think the book is somewhat interesting and well-written, I believe it might be better appreciated by young adults. Much of the type of angst seen in Holden is diminished with age, for the most part.    At age 16, Holden Caulfield has been kicked out of Pencey, the latest of several private schools which he's attended. He lacks direction in life, both in the long term sense and in the short term of what he's going to do next. He's not upset about leaving Pencey at all, he didn't really like any of the other students or faculty there much. In fact, there are very few people whom Holden likes. Asked to name people he genuinely likes, Holden would probably name his younger sister Phoebe and his brother Allie, who died young. He views a lot of the people he encounters as phonies. He hates movies and dislikes shows only slightly less, although he does take his friend Sally to one. Even when he calls friends up, they quickly get on his nerves. In general, Holden is rarely truly happy.    I can see how some young adults might identify with Holden's character and attitude toward others and life. At that age many people are unhappy because the toys and games of childhood have lost their appeal, yet they cannot partake in all the things in which adults find enjoyment.

Sure, it tries (and at times succeeds) to convey a feeling of apathetic innocence, but its construction is rather off-putting and it's overall anticlimactic result is less ambiguously rewarding and more strangely hollow.<br /><br />`The Catcher in the Rye' is an ambitious story that attempts to say a lot but fails to really live up to its potential.<br /><br />The novel tells of two mere days in the life of the recently expelled sixteen-year-old Holden Caulfield.  Not wanting to face the wrath of his parents, Holden decides to avoid home for a few days (until he's expected back), living on his own in the city.  The premise is merely a foundation for Holden's simplistic views and reasoning's concerning life and his future.  He considers everyone around him to be fake and undeserving of his time, yet it is obvious that Holden is just as `phony' as the rest of them.  He goes on dates, gets trashed at bars, sneaks off to visit his sister, imposes (or does he) on a former teacher and even has a run in with a pimp.<br /><br />Sadly, all of this is conveyed in Holden's uninteresting and at times aggravating delivery.<br /><br />I'm not trying to lighten the point which J.D. Salinger was trying to make, for it is a very poignant (maybe even more so today then when the novel was actually written) point.  Our young ones are just as misplaced and confused as Holden, and so his tale of apathy masked desperation is one that we could all learn from; but Salinger loses my patience with his redundancy.  Some have complained of the same thing, which I was pleased to see (it proves that some people are willing to think outside of the preordained box).  Holden says the same thing on just about every page, so much so that the surprise is stripped from us and we are left with a predictable tale of teenage angst.  Maybe that was the point, to expose the lack of genuine life that resides inside someone of Holden's nature.  He thinks that he is the only `real' person around yet it is obvious to all onlookers that he is basically walking death.  He is offering nothing, yet he `has' potential; or so we are told.<br /><br />The story is crucial yet the delivery makes this a difficult read, one that you almost don't want to bother with.  I've read novels that are hard to read due to their construction, yet they possess a certain otherworldliness that make then necessary (look at `A Clockwork Orange' for just that), but `The Catcher in the Rye' lacks the emotional connection needed to make it worth suffering through.  In the end the novels brilliant moments (like Holden's confession as to what it is he really wants to be) are masked by all of the mediocre (or just plain uninspiring) ones, leaving us with a novel that feels incomplete and a concept that deserved so much more than it got.<br /><br />And the ending, I just have this to say.  I am all for the anticlimactic; believe me.  I relish in the idea of a simple `stop' put to a novel, for it allows the reader to move on with a sense of personalized closure.  I often think of Bret Easton Ellis, in particular `Less Than Zero' when I think of that sort of ending; an open ended closing that leaves you deciding the fates of the characters yourself.  If often works beautifully, but here it seems rather empty as apposed to rich with meaning.<br /><br />I just kind of shrugged it off because I didn't really care what happened next.<br /><br />One might protest that that is the point, that we aren't supposed to care about Holden, thus furthering the poignancy of Salinger's point; but to them I have only this to say:  \\""YOU HAVE TO CARE FOR IT TO MATTER.\\""  You cannot reach an audience if they are not moved.If we adopt the same apathetic attitude of the main character then we simply have not achieved the desired response.  If this novel is to mean anything then we have to be stunned, mortified and moved to action because of it; and for that to happen it has to be delivered in a way that actually EFFECTS us.  For me, and apparently a few others, Salinger didn't do that.<br /><br />I know that I am in the minority here, but I have to speak my truth.ter then we simply have not achieved the desired response.

Here is a young man with issues, many issues, trying to keep his head above the surface and survive with a mental illness.

Holden is at times the annoying smarty-pants sibling and roomie, but he's always authentic as a character. He's terribly unreliable as a narrator, but that reveals so much more about him than if Salinger had chosen to give an omniscient perspective.<br /><br />All that is still true on my second reading of it, but this time round, I felt Holden's loneliness as well. He prattles nonstop to keep himself occupied and deflect from his aimless search for something or someone to fill the silence. He is the king of digression, famously failing oral composition because he claimed he had a headache, but like he reveals about a classmate who failed as well, it was because he couldn't stick to just one subject. In many ways, Holden's stream-of-consciousness narrative is reflective of the fragmented and seemingly directionless discourse that Modernist writers engage in as a comment on the sentiments of an age of uncertainty and cynicism at structure and order. It is an attempt to articulate the quest to forge new meaning and purpose against the threat of all that is \\""phony\\"" (a favourite Holden observation).<br /><br />As Holden observes of a polished skater at Radio City, \\""He was a very good skater and all, but I couldn't enjoy it much because I kept picturing him practicing to be a guy that roller-skates the stage. It seemed so stupid.\\"" Holden can't understand artifice, and his unadorned thoughts and feelings often get him into trouble when he articulates them. In a sense, for all of Holden's unreliable ramblings, he is just being incredibly honest.<br /><br />Holden, at the end of the day, is a deeply compassionate character whose innocence and simplicity provides him with the most moving connection with his kid sister, Phoebe.",2009-09-09

The main character, Holden Caulfield, describes a few days in his life that occurred earlier; he writes from a psychiatric facility.  The reader gets to experience, primarily from his youthful point of view, the struggles of his adolescence.  Holden is a sad, lonely, depressed boy growing up in a wealthy New York family during the 1950's.  A younger brother has recently died of leukemia, an 11 year old sister lives at home, and an older brother is in California.  Holden has attended---and failed out of---many boarding schools.  Holden's dad is a successful lawyer, but little is shared about his mother.  Holden is an adolescent lost in the chasm between childhood and adulthood.  He is frightened of the changes he knows are on the horizon, and puts up an armor of cynicism to guard against being hurt and moving forward.  He views most adults and many of his peers as \\""phonies\\"".  The impact of the death of his brother is also a significant factor in Holden's life.  As the story ends, it is hard to be optimistic about this character's future.  Catcher in the Rye is often read in high school, but I think the poignancy of the book is lost on the typical teen.

Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, written in 1951, is about longing for the simple truths of childhood, but ultimately struggling to cope with the issues that force a soul to grow. The book is psychologically arduous, as Salinger boldly travels deep into the mind of his protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Holden's views regarding people are rather bitter and disparaging. Despite his loose-tongued narration, he recounts his many plights in New York City with a plaintive undertone. Though he dances with women, dates pretty girls, and drinks with old acquaintances, nothing eases his despair and loneliness. Likewise, nothing abolishes his thoughts that all those people are \\""phonies,\\"" and it almost seems that the only thing keeping him around them is morbid fascination in their shallow behavior. As the novel progresses, however, Phoebe is introduced, and the reader witnesses something very important in Holden's character. Essentially, Phoebe still retains the innocence and simple wisdom Holden subconsciously misses. They are the qualities that leave all humans in the process of growing up. His meeting with Phoebe forces him to realize how he is straying from his true self. Holden realizes that while he's been deeming society fake, he's been trying to find his place within it, and meanwhile letting a vague, superficial version of himself rise to the surface.    This novel does the meaningful job of revealing the truth behind all people. While the act of hiding one's true self can be seen as an act of self-defense against others, it is essentially harmful to the soul. What makes this book unique is that it encompasses important life revelations over a short period of time, and from point of view of a teenage boy. The language and suggestive material in the novel (such as Sunny the prostitute and Holden's drinking) deemed it provocative, to the point where the book was banned in many school curriculums. What the advocates of these book bans didn't realize was that the \\""offensive\\"" elements of the story (Holden's swearing, for instance) are necessary to show the vivid personality of Holden. In a wider sense, these elements are critical components that create striking realism in the novel. This level of brutal realism could not be achieved otherwise, for in real life, certain things trouble certain people, and if the author was working to portray real life, why should Holden's universe be an exception? The Catcher in the Rye is a very thought-provoking novel when the offensive aspects can be appreciated for the relevancy they have in Holden's story. As well, this can help a reader to understand Holden, and thus make his situations, thoughts, and the timeless themes surrounding them more relatable and real. Take the time to discover Holden's truth.",2009-06-19

Salinger's impressive novel deals with Holden Caulfied, a sixteen year old boy, who is expelled from Pencey for his poor grades, and consequently decides to explore New York City before confronting his parents with the unfortunate news. In New York City Caulfield reveals his view of the world through the characters.          Caulfield considers people like Ackley, Stradlater, and Lillian Simmons as \\""phonies\\"" and \\""morons\\"", in which he repeatedly criticizes their fakeness and unintelligence.  He has an obvious dislike for adults and sees them as a corruption to society, and his encounters lead to separation. Caulfield's description of adults limits the perception of the readers and emphasizes the havoc in adulthood.           This negative aspect of people is not true for every character introduced to readers. Caulfield exposes his peaceful side when he speaks of his sister Phoebe, his brother Allie, Jane Gallagher, and the singing boy. Caulfield's memories of his family regard his childhood and their innocence. The thought of Jane, an old friend, brings a sense of joy in Caulfield's eyes because he contemplates on their angelic friendship. The boy walking down the side walk sings \\""If a body catch a body coming through the rye\\"". Caulfield states that this relieves his depression, and confesses to Phoebe he wants to be the person guarding kids from carelessly running over a cliff on the rye.          This is an exceptional novel written by Salinger, and I especially recommend this to young and old readers because it concerns both age groups. This book discusses the big gap between the new and the old age, and Caulfield struggles to accept his time for maturity.

He has trouble maturing throughout his teenage years, but this is a very funny and entertaining story telling of how a young and troublesome boy grows up.

That is the thing about The Catcher in the Rye.  Some people are not ready to read this example of how the male-teenage mind operates during this trying period of human development, or they only wish to deny its truth.<br /><br />What makes Holden a likable character is that he embodies the fear of growing up that exists in every teenager, whether they're willing to admit it or not.  Holden's only difference that separates him from most teens is how frantically he tries to PREVENT himself and those around him from growing up.  The character allows teens to recognize how trying the American transition into adulthood really is.  You see in most cultures you have a trial or ritual and then BOOM! you're an adult whether you like it or not.  The Catcher in the Rye shows how that in the American culture we basically have an 8-10 year long period where we are WAITING to grow-up.<br /><br />J.D.

It is his constant annoyance that leads to the reader either to identify with the him or to detest. Very few other characters in novels have the power to reflect both ways like Holden does. There is no gray area with Holden. It is interesting that people find it boring jsut because of Holden. But the novel does what it is supposed to do. It commands the reader to think and to start developing provoking ideas. He does not resemble the good in human nature. On the contrary, he completely exposes humanity. It leaves naked and exposed to be examined and digested by the reader. It is the perfect parallel to the Lord of the Flies. In both novels, human nature is not promoted.

This one is about the coming of age of one Holden Caulfield(?) after he runs away from school.  The novel is told through his point of view and allows you to know everything he's thinking which is excellent for this story.  Holden is smart, hilarious, and sensitive in a way that allows you to connect with him instantly because he tries to hide how vulnerable he actually is.  He reminds me of a kid version of Chandler Bing on Friends.  Basically, Holden wanders around what I think is New York if memory serves and gets into all sorts of fiascos.  He has a keen eye for observance and is wise beyond his years.  Though he is but a teen, I constantly found myself thinking him to be a young man much older.  Along the way Holden meets various friends and people, most of whom he dislikes.  Those he doesn't dislike are special indeed though.  Salinger uses these people to tackle greater themes through Holden's relationship with them.  A quick example would be the girl that Holden met and played checkers with.  He repeatedely says throughout how she \\""never moved her back row\\"" or something to that effect which doesn't make much sense until you meet Holden's athletic and womanizing schoolmate and learn that he has a date with her.  Holden desperately wants to know from him if she still never moves her back row.  She represents something pure and virginal for the boy and he doesn't want her tainted because he cares about her.  Something else I really enjoyed was when Holden met his sister Phoebe.  She is a few years younger than him and their relationship is beautiful and touching.  He really goes on and on about he before we ever see her and it's obvious how much he loves her.  Once they do meet, he angers her and what happens as they make up is something special.  There is alot of symbolism in this novel, too much to talk about here.  Check out the significance of Holden's hat and also his baseball glove.  My favorite part comes when he explains what the Catcher in the Rye truly means and when he'd done that, I knew this book had gone beyond.

Maybe that's why this book is considered great: it gets the reader thinking. It gets the reader confused. It got this reader confused. What am I supposed to end up thinking about Holden? Is he this arrogant, anti-social, know-it-all who thinks nearly every human interaction is phony and that living in the woods would be a golldarn utopia? Or is he this searching, sentimental, awkward, scared kid who's looking for answers, but can't find them in the world he currently inhabits? I lean towards the latter. He's looking for authenticity, for realness in the world, but he's doubtful he's got enough patience to find it.",2009-02-05

J. D. Salinger depicts the life of Holden, a young boy disillusioned with his life who holds the belief that he must be the \\""catcher in the rye,\\"" a savior of innocent children.     Although it has been praised and well received by the younger generation who feel that Holden is a character they can relate to, I found the novel rather boring. Holden might be lost and confused, but it does nothing to soften the annoyance felt at his immaturity and the absurdity of his thoughts. The situation with Holden's brother Allie does elicit some sympathy toward his mental condition and even his immaturity. However, his frequent childish notions to pay for a prostitute and to call up an old friend merely to engage him in a sexual conversation make his actions less forgiving. Even though most teenagers from various eras have found connection to Holden, I personally find Holden's thoughts too extreme and too incomprehensible for me to relate at all.     Nonetheless, Salinger's characters are developed extremely well. Even after reading the whole novel, there is still much more to the characters than Salinger chose to reveal. In addition, the characters are all fairly realistic and fairly likable, especially Mr. Antolini. Mr. Antolini is one of Holden's old teachers and the one that Holden looks up to. Clever and sympathetic, Antolini, like other teachers like Mr. Spencer, tries to reach out to Holden. This, however, makes Holden's story all the more frustrating. He has so many people in his life who are willing to help and guide him, yet he refuses to listen and insists on acting like a grown up child.     It is also undeniably true that The Catcher in the Rye is masterfully written. Full of symbols and images, Salinger succeeds in conveying the traumatized nature of Holden's mind. The vivid descriptions Salinger employs in his narration aid in envisioning the situation and engaging the reader in the story.     Salinger frequently uses italics to emphasis certain words that Holden places an emphasis on. The italics are usually indications of the deep cynicism that Holden harbors for anything and everything in the world around him. J. D. Salinger narrates in the voice of Holden using short, choppy sentences and utilizing to the fullest extent the technique of fragments. Through such syntactical structure, Salinger creates a fast pacing that reflects upon the frantic and haphazard stream of thoughts that characterizes Holden's through process.     Although Holden fails to exert the same pull on me as it does on other teenagers, it is irrefutable that J. D. Salinger is a master of his art. A reader looking for a easy and lighthearted read will find The Catcher in the Rye a tedious and pointless read. However, those disenchanted with the society around them may find it easier to relate to the young Holden and thus, enjoy the book.",2009-01-27

That's exactly what J.D Sallinger did with his character Holden Caulfield.<br /><br />To break it down simply enough, Holden is sixteen-years-old. He's also stuck in a very bad situation. He's at a fancy private school that he absolutely hates. He's failing, so much so that he's about to get kicked out. So, before he gets kicked out, he decides to leave and take a `break' from everything that's been happening to his life.<br /><br />After leaving the school, he begins his `break' by reconnecting with some old memories. He rents a hotel room and reflects on the people he's known, particular some past girlfriends and a friend from another school.<br /><br />The thing that makes THE CATCHER IN THE RYE different from most books about teenagers is that Holden isn't a stereotype. We quickly pick this up early in the novel, when we learn that Holden has A LOT to say about his situation. His characterization is only further proven when he decides to buy a `night' with a girl. It turns out that Holden's not into that; he simply wants someone to talk to. The fact that he isn't a stereotype is what makes him so interesting. But, you're probably wondering, if he isn't a stereotype, how can we relate to him? It's because Holden, like all other teenagers, has problems.<br /><br />I can't say a whole lot more about the book without giving it away. It's fairly short--the mass market paperback being only 214 pages--but it makes for a quick read. I found myself reading it slower though. It's easier to reflect on a book like THE CATCHER IN THE RYE if read in pieces, not all at once.<br /><br />The main moral of the book is that teenagers have it hard, regardless of who they are and where they might be. They've all got problems, they've all got fears, hopes and dreams. There's no escaping what's happening when you're a teenager, and Sallinger captured that perfectly.<br /><br />THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is a book EVERYONE should read.",2009-01-09

I also got the feeling, as I read it - and I base this on nothing but gut instinct - that this book heralded in a new dawn of writing.  Kudos Salinger!<br /><br />I can't help but love Holden Caulfield, despite all his depression and misery and angst.  I don't know if you'd call it a criticism, but everything about him is pre-conscious, yearning to get real and honest and become true to himself, but at the same time so lost and blocked.  My gut vibe on Caulfield is that if he were real and grew up to be an adult he would never really get conscious.  I just don't see it happening with him.  Like, for all his beauty and caring and humanity, he's just too self-hating, self-destructive, traumatized, and dishonest to really ever become truly conscious.<br /><br />And if the life of J.D.

It's always been on my \\""list\\"" to eventually read, but it never climbed up to the top until now.

I also know that the book was banned for many years and I wouldn't be surprised if there was still a ban (even if unofficial) of it at Viewmont. I decided to do a quick stats check on it being banned and saw that interestingly it has a very divided history. Up until the 80s, it was the most banned/censored book in high schools & libraries. In the early 80s it was paradoxically the \\""most censored book\\"" and the \\""second most taught book\\"" in public schools. In situations where it isn't banned outright, it pushes its way into the top 20 list of \\""most frequently challenged book.\\""    From a super high level reading, I can see where the angst against the book comes from. The book is FULL of profanity from the first page to the last ranging from the more commonplace to the F-bomb. It doesn't help matters that this language is coming from a teenager, the narrator Holden Cawfield. Add to that the fact that this same teenager (and most people he associates with) are constantly smoking and drinking. While there isn't explicit sex in the book, there are numerous high level references to necking, petting and intercourse as well as general explorations of sexuality as a whole. Overall, this is just the sort of book that makes \\""family values\\"" advocates run for the bonfires.    At the same time, the book is extremely \\""real\\"" in terms of dealing with the identity crisis and the sort of awakening of self-awareness that happens to teenagers. While I wasn't a swearing, smoking, drinking, sexing teenager(or adult for that matter), I can relate to a lot of things said by Holden. And even though there aren't any earth shattering answers or resolutions given through the narrative, simply exploring these truths rather than brushing them under the carpet is enough to make most teenagers (or anybody who's ever felt alienated, confused, or just anxious about life) able to relate to this book at some level and use it as a launching ground for the basis of their own self-awakening.    The honesty of the narrative voice is refreshing but can also be the cause for some controversy. Most parents or adults don't necessarily want to admit that the youth of the world are struggling with these sorts of issues both in terms of the smoking/drinking/sex and in terms of the emotional and mental anxieties. Whether that's because the adults have suppressed their own anxious memories of their youth or because they don't have any idea how to help their youth through the situations, I'm not sure. But it seems that a lot of times, the adult reaction to \\""troubled\\"" youth is to just punish them and/or leave them alone and assume that as they mature they'll either turn into upstanding adults and overcome the problems on their own or they'll turn into really bad eggs and end up in prison. Either way, the problem is no longer a threat to society.    There's a lot more I could say about this book, and I haven't even bothered to review it in the same way I've reviewed other recent books, but I think the best thing to say about this book is that it should be read in order to fully digest and understand it. As I mentioned above, there is definitely some content that can be offensive to many readers. However, the way the content is presented feels natural and makes it hard to fault the book or author for its presence but rather just accept the presence as a part of the character you're exploring.    As a parent, I'm a little torn as to when I'd want my kids to read this book. It gets into a sort of maturity conundrum. I'd have some moderate worries that the book could possibly give an immature reader some bad ideas, but if a reader is sheltered from the book until they're \\""mature\\"" enough to better swallow the concepts, then some of the potential help and insight of the book can be lost. I don't think this book portrays delinquent or rebellious behavior in a positive light by any means. It straddles the fence a little bit with drinking and smoking which is understandable considering the era in which it was written/published (the 40s-50s) but even then, it shows some of the bad effects of these bad decisions.    I think the main thing with this book, as with anything anybody ever decides to approach, is that it should be approached with a grain of salt and with an open mind tempered by mature responsibility. I wouldn't mind seeing this book in my kids' reading list in high school...possibly even junior high. But I'd want to be sure that I (and hopefully the teacher as well, but definitely myself as a parent) discuss with my kids what is to be gained from the book, what is to be learned from the book, and how to poise a reaction to the book. That's not to say that I'd want to brainwash my kids and try to shove propaganda down their throats, but I'd just want to be sure that they (and any reader...yourself included), takes this in (and any book) as something to be learned from but not necessarily emulated.    The Catcher in the Rye is a very intriguing exploration into the psyche of the American teenager (specifically, a male teenager...I'd be curious to hear female reactions) and I think Sallinger hit many of the key teenage issues squarely on the head without coming off as preachy or condescending. Apart from the controversy of the content, perhaps that non-preachy form is another thing that makes society dislike this book. It explores a lot of the problems of teenage life, but never sets for a clear course of action to overcome them...leaving the teenager to figure things out for him/herself. Depending on the support structure of the kid, having all those ideas and issues opened wide could either be very constructive or very destructive. I hope to help my kids with the 'constructive' path when they get around to reading it.    *****  4 1/2 stars",2008-12-04

From Holden's encounter with the water-spitting perverts to Holden's date with Sally in New York, the Catcher in the Rye is a great example of what the teenage years are like. This excellent novel is one that I truly related to, being a teenager experiencing some of the same feelings that Holden feels. While I don't know what it feels like to lose a loved one like Holden does, I understand how he feels about sexuality and that struggle to maintain what is innocent in the world, and I even could experience some of what it would feel like to lose a loved one through Holden's touching rhetoric in the novel. Some people might be offended by Holden's swearing, but I believe it helps us see more eye-to-eye to Holden. If the novel was written in a more articulate manner, the theme of the struggle for communication would be harder to convey. Furthermore, we relate more with him and feel like he is one of us. In several points of the novel, I felt myself laughing when funny parts happened and crying when sad parts occurred.

Contemptable.","I've read the Glass family saga by Salinger and, while I don't LIKE them, I find them infinitely more mature, more satisfying, and less juvenile.     I don't find that Holden ever LEARNS anything in this book. In a novel about the coming of age of the narrator, something should happen that makes him or her learn that their former point of view was wrong and immature. Nothing happens in this book that does that.    Instead, we are \\""treated\\"" to a young man who is tall and has gray hair. Indeed, he considers himself wise beyond his years. But he isn't. Really, he is an angry young man. Perhaps he is surrounded by phonies. Perhaps he justifiably loathes those around him, and perhaps he is vindicated in his displeasure for nearly everything except for his sainted young brother.    I don't particularly care if thousands of people can relate to Holden Caulfield, frankly. I can't. This is true both for stylistic reasons (which I will get to in a moment) and for characterization reasons. Holden is, honestly, an obnoxious little jerk. He hates nearly everything around him, and he makes no apologies for it (which is refreshing, or would be, if he didn't hate nearly everything). The problem is that he shows no sign of intelligence, in the ENTIRE novel, but he perceives himself as suave, charming, and worldly. He is not. He is small-minded and has no greater perception of the world than a child born in Kansas in the same time would have. There is no reason to consider young Holden anything other than a stuck-up, pretentious brat.    Stylistically, the novel is like a trip to a sadistic dentist who forgets your anesthesia. The language is, typically, annoying. J.D. Salinger seems incapable of properly using emphatic italics, and this is never brought into greater light than in this novel where they are used both properly (to highlight the vapidity of one of his older brother's former girlfriends, to correct the spelling and pronunciation of particular words) and improperly (to emphasize useless portions of words, much as appears in later Glass family stories). Further yet, he uses the same language over and over throughout the novel. Our obnoxious protagonist will say something that kills him or knocks him out or annoys him, and will follow it, nearly 100% of the time with, \\""I'm not kidding,\\"" and then an exact repetition of the same phrase. This is particularly grating when they are, by a trick of the typeset, EXACTLY above and below each other on the page. I'm not kidding, it is really annoying. Really.    All that said, I understand why so many people adore this novel. If you read this when your mind is small and you are frustrated with those around you, it could feel like a life line. The problem is that it is such a nihilistic life line, because Holden never finds out just how stupid and vapid he is. This perhaps leads to my greatest frustration with this novel. It is not a coming of age story. It is merely the story of one young man's few days in New York City after being expelled from his school.    Holden is what makes so many adults think that teenagers are simply small-minded. Teenagers will read this book and they will think that they are like Holden. They will reach the end, where Holden learns nothing, and they will feel vindicated in their point of view. And their point of view is WRONG. This is the problem. Because they feel vindicated, they will not seek to expand, to grow, and adults will assume that all teenagers are as foolish and small-minded as Holden Caulfield. Which is a disservice, because I have known so many teenagers so much more worldly and so much smarter, and so many adults who weren't.     How much damage has Mr. Salinger done with this novel? No one can tell. The only good thing about it is that it, sadly, gives a voice to so much teenage angst and loneliness that may have no other destination for camaraderie. This validates its existence, but doesn't make it a classic.    If you are seventeen and angsty (or fourteen and angsty, or forty and angsty, or...) read it and see if it fits. If you enjoy it, well, more power to you. Try to grow past it though. It is so small, and there are so many wonderful things in the world...    D    Harkius",2008-10-21

I'll merely focus on one reason this is such an important book and then comment on one odd yet persistent misreading of the novel.<br /><br />First, this is the first novel that was written with the narrative voice of a disgruntled youth.  In fact, one of the most amazing developments in the 1950s was the birth of Youth.  Before the fifties there was no sharp chasm dividing young and old.  There were, of course, differences between being young and being older, but the main difference was mainly that you were merely younger, not that you embraced a completely different culture.  CATCHER IN THE RYE anticipated everything that was about to happen in youth culture within the next few years.  No novel had been written in slang before, at least not in youth slang.  You would be a very rich man or woman if you could count the number of times that Holden says something like \\""I'm not kidding\\"" or \\""I can't stand it.\\""  Salinger's genius for maintaining a consistent narrative voice from beginning to end is unquestionably one of the novel's greatest claims to fame.<br /><br />The second thing I wanted to mention is the rather bizarre turn that so many people consier Holden Caulfield a hero.  If anything is clear in the novel, it is that Holden is a profoundly troubled, disturbed, emotionally stunted and sick individual.  The events he narrates are cleary done so in a mental health institution.  For all his railing against phonies, no one in the book is as phony as Holden.  To appropriate the language of existentialism, he lives a completely inauthentic life.  But sadly the only person who calls him on the pathetic existence he is living is his teacher that Holden suspects of making sexual overtures near the end.  But clearly the events in the novel presaged some kind of emotional collapse.  Holden at age 17 in the mental institution writes about significant events leading up to his collapse at age 16.  That anyone could view Holden as a role model or a hero is unfathomable.<br /><br />I reread this because I'm about the read the Frank Portman novel KING DORK, in which CATCHER IN THE RYE features prominently.

Holden liked to hang with his buddies, smoke and drink, had a marvelous opinion of himself while being viciously disdainful of everyone else, and he was smart, too.  He was just like me.<br /><br />Coming back to this American classic close to thirty years later, my perspective has changed quite a bit.  I'm no longer a young man, and Holden is not the cool dude I once recognized.  In fact, he's immature, judgmental, dishonest, wasteful, unappreciative and more than anything, pretentious.  He's a directionless, self-pitying jerk, and what he needs is a swift kick in the rear from his wealthy, climbing, city-dwelling socialite parents, who are clearly too busy with their own lives to properly rear him or his siblings.  He is everything wrong with material success, with its entitlement and the ennui which comes with never being challenged.<br /><br />More than anything, what hammered me in the forehead from the very first chapter was that Holden Caulfield IS America.  In the 1940s, as America became the global giant, here is Holden Caulfield representing every aspect of it.  He grows up too quickly and is immature, believing he is not.  He is given much of what he has, really never having to work for any of it, and is ungrateful, not realizing what it took to get him where he is.  His immaturity leads him to speak far too often when he would serve himself better to be quiet and just listen and learn.  He cannot stay with a single task or a long-term project; he has to jump to another and another and another.  He derives his self-worth from his shallow and meaningless relationships, which are self-serving, fleeting and often just plain false.  He is smitten by Jane Gallagher, but never levels with her, never tells her the truth; he just avoids it.  He is directionless, accepts no challenges, and feels no remorse for his mistakes.  When he fails, he sees it coming and does nothing, then he rationalizes it away and flees, rather than taking responsibility and making things right.  He denounces everyone and everything as pretentious and phony, when that is exactly what he is.  He wants to be a grown-up, and play-acts at being one, never understanding what it takes to join that cohort.<br /><br />Interesting is that both of what today would be called mentors to Holden are people he essentially describes and we see as failures.  His old teacher is superficially respected for his knowledge, but Holden sees him as grubby and poor, the unavoidable physical manifestation of his age compromising any real influence he could have on the young man.  Mr. Antolini turns out to be a false mentor, a closeted homosexual driven to alcoholism, who attempts to molest the naïve Holden (depending on your interpretation).<br /><br />Given the period in which it was written and restrictions on publishers, I can understand the book's lack of profanity, but its absence in a boy of 16-17 compromises his character.  This was even more so with regard to the lack of sex.  Holden was more interested in drinking and smoking than in sex, and I found that as a teenager reading it and again as a 40-something geezer that just doesn't ring true.  He talks about it, and mentions it from time to time, but it is not in Holden the undeniable primitive driver that I know it to be.<br /><br />Fascinating in this book is the absence of World War II.  There are a few mentions of men in uniform, but precious little else about the war.  Even a teenager's self-absorbed detachment could not escape this oppressive fact from 1939 to 1945 and well after, especially a teenager who soon enough would be eligible for the draft.  This can only be a deliberate omission from Salinger, and it is another aspect of the book which I feel compromises it.

I continue to adore Holden's memory of his brother, Allie, and his relationship with his little sister, Phoebe.

Salinger, is a fiction novel about the hardships of life as a teenager.     After sixteen year old Holden Caulfield gets kicked out of his fourth school in a row he ventures out into the world to find what makes him happy. Eventually, he decides that what he truly wants to be is \\""the catcher in the rye.\\"" He describes one of his dreams where he is keeping younger kids from falling off the edge of a steep cliff while they are playing in a field of rye. This is the only thing he wants to do with his life to make him happy.     I found this book to be very interesting and it was fairly simple to just sit down and read without hesitation. This book would be a good choice for teenagers because it's easy to relate to for all of the problems that teens have to go through like school, love, family, and their future.     Although this book is about the hard times of a teenager it has many humorous parts. The author often talks about Holden's relationships with girls and how awkward some of them can be. He is also never afraid to say any of his thoughts out loud which makes the book enjoyable and entertaining.     This book was a memorable story and has become one of my favorites. However this book is difficult to understand in some parts because of the wide variety of vocabulary, but after you get past that it's a great book.",2008-03-05

I wanted to like the book, I really did.  I hadn't the slightest clue of what it was about, just knew it was a highly regarded piece of literature and that it was the book Mark David Chapman was obsessed with when he shot John Lennon.    I enjoyed the writing style.  The main character speaks to you directly, as if telling you a story over a cup of coffee.  The opening paragraph has got to be one of the most appealing openings to a book I have ever read.  When you finally learn what the title of the book means, you wonder why it never caught on as a mainstream phrase like \\""Catch-22\\"" did.    With that being said, the book really goes no where.  It starts off promising; a teenage boy named Holden Caulfield, talking about how he ended up where he currently tells his story from, a rest home he was sent to for therapy.  I expected the rest of the book to tell me some horrific tale of terrible events that led up to Holden having to be sent away.     Far from it.  We follow Holden through the days following his expulsion from school and him going back to New York to eventually face his parents, who have yet to learn of the news.    That's about it.  There's nothing concrete about what causes Holden to end up a 'mad man'.  Maybe this book has lost its touch over the years.  Holden often talks about what society now considers 'light' subjects, but will interject with a 'could you believe it?' or a 'I swear it's true', or something along those lines, leaving me to chuckle at the fact those particular topics were considered taboo at some point in time.  Yet the way Holden speaks, cursing every chance he gets (to the point where characters in the story are constantly telling him to steady off the curse words), would make someone think that he's no stranger to those sort of things.    Some memorable quotes here and there, but overall I wouldn't be bothered recommending the book to anyone.",2008-03-04

That is the plot of \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"". It's a pretty flimsy plot, but the writing is beautiful. Salinger has given Holder Caulfield the voice of a lonely, immature young man who doesn't understand how immature he really is, and that voice is pitch perfect.    Holden Caulfield is one of those characters who you will either love or you will want to slap silly. I am one of those people who fits into the former category, whereas my father is one of those who fits into the latter category and I think the difference is largely due to the fact that Holden Caulfield reminds me of me, whereas my father can't identify with him at all. It's impossible to determine which category you will fit into. However, a large number of people have managed to draw inspiration from this work over the years including Bill Gates, Tom Robbins, Stephen Chbosky, and a convicted murderer or two.    \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" is J.D.

Cooley's Review of The Catcher In The Rye","I suspect that I'm not the only member of Generation X who should've read this book while young, but didn't, and have now rediscovered it as a middle-aged adult.  I have a vague recollection this book was assigned reading when I was in college.  I probably skimmed it, wrote a paper about it, got my passing C grade, and moved on, as I did with many a reading assignment in the `80s.      I'm afraid I would've enjoyed it more, had I not been influenced by all the hype.  There's only one thing worse than assigned reading by a professor, and that is recommended reading from family or friends.  The childish rebel in us all wants to do the opposite of what we're told we should do.  This is also one of those books that people my age are always being asked whether they've read or not, particularly male English majors like myself, and then worse being told they should read it, usually by some phony uncle who got way more out of it back in his day because of what was considered in its time to be rebellious, controversial language.  The funny thing is, phony (to use the main character Holden Caufield's favorite adjective) uncles like these seem to have missed the book's main message, which was perhaps hidden by their excitement over the blunt teen colloquialisms of that era.      To me, this book should teach a lesson to the reader that one shouldn't try to ship their kids off to schools to rid themselves of the hassles of parenthood when those kids are unwilling or uncertain about it.  Such action puts parents at risk, after becoming empty-nesters, of wishing they'd spent more time with their kids and had developed better relationships with them.  This book is filled with conversational language and stream-of-consciousness writing style that, while entertaining, masks the overall message of the importance of family.      While at first glance, one might think the protagonist's cynicism is hilarious, but upon further discovery one realizes it is incredibly sad.  Likewise, on the surface it appears to be a simple story of a child struggling with becoming an adult, when in fact it is a deeper tale of neglect, and of a depressed child being \\""pushed out of the nest\\"" before ready. When Holden hears the little kid singing the \\""catcher in the rye\\"" song, and it makes him feel better, it's because the scene symbolizes his yearning to be a happy child with the comfort of his family nearby.  Holden's parents continually want to ship him off to any boarding school who will take him, which not only shows they don't care much for him, but aren't willing to put in the effort to prepare him for the challenges of adulthood.  One would think his parents would want to maximize their time with him, having lost another child previously, but the opposite has occurred.      At age 16, Holden wants what he's never been able to get -the love of his parents.  Although they've provided for him well, it is apparent that he does not value being sent to the finest schools, having the finest clothing, etc., and instead contemplates moving to Colorado for a more modest life devoid of such superficial things and people.  He decides to stay home for one reason only, and that is to be able to spend time with the one family member who returns his unconditional love, his little sister Phoebe.      Maybe the moral lesson to be learned is that one should consider himself lucky if he can count on his hand one relative with whom it is important for him to maintain a meaningful relationship with, one that includes unconditional love;  and that to be a wealthy person one needs much more than material things or the \\""advantages\\"" of a prep school education.",2008-02-01

The narrative style is first person, so the reader is forced to endure Holden's puerile blather throughout the entirety of the work.

The amount of pointless vulgarity and blasphemous language contained in The Catcher in the Rye is so overwhelming, even by today's standards, that the reader quickly becomes numb to it.

Salinger, was definitely worth the fight. Although banned from schools when it was first published because of the encouragement of profanity, prostitution, and premarital sex, it still became one of the most frequently taught novels in public high schools.     The novel's narrator, Holden Caulfield, is an epitome of Salinger at the age of sixteen. Holden tells the story of his expulsion from his private school, Pencey prep, and his escape to New York City before his parents find out. While in the city, Holden discovers more about himself than he ever would have if he had merely stayed at Pencey for the last few days before vacation.     While Holden is not a very focused character, he does eventually get his point across. He often goes off on a tangent while trying to clarify a simple point, instead of just stating a straightforward sentence. Nevertheless, Holden does make it back to his point, leaving the reader with a thorough understanding of his recent topic.     Holden does not believe that being an adult is a good thing. He feels that, once one makes his or her way to adulthood, he/she becomes a phony. This is true with his friends, Stradlater, Ackley, and Sally.

Although Holden over-exaggerates, he says what he means. Stradlater, Ackley, and Sally, on the other hand, say what they believe will impress other people.     The reason for the title of the book, The Catcher in the Rye, is revealed when Holden explains to Phoebe that he actually wants to be a \\""catcher in the rye.\\"" \\""Comin' thro' the Rye\\"" is an actual poem by Robert Burns, which is where Salinger gets the idea for the \\""catcher in the rye.\\"" Holden says that he wishes there was an occupation where he could save a bunch of children who are playing in a field of ryefrom falling off of a cliff. His job would be to catch the children if they start to go off the cliff, and he explains that he would do this all day, and that he would be \\""the catcher in the rye and all.\\"" This job symbolizes what Holden does for everyone in the world. He wants to protect people's innocence, even though he has lost his own.      Although the novel has a controversial past, I do not believe that that should dissuade anyone from reading The Catcher in the Rye.

Escaping from a prep school, Holden Caulfield, a teenager failing every subject except for English, is ready to move on, but he doesn't know how. He often wonders where the ducks in Central Park will go in the winter, but he is actually thinking about his future when Christmas break comes. The protagonist lets his anger, resentment, and fears out as he goes on describing a story of his own. The meaningful plot makes me understand about life more than any other book. The ending of this brilliant masterpiece is like a slow- motion romance movie. Holding his loved one in the air, Holden is finally satisfied with his life, something he has never experienced before. It has been a while since I finished reading this book, but I still think of it everyday. J. D. Salinger created a deep and meaningful storyline for the readers to think and develop it further.

Was there a clue in the story that inspired the twisted killer to attack Lennon?  Anyhow, if so, then Chapman was not caught and saved by the Catcher, but instead went entirely off the cliff. And if Chapman envisioned himself as the Catcher, he was wrong. The Catcher in the Rye is a saver not a destroyer.     Although I rate this book five stars it is by far not my favorite, but I would still recommend it to anyone just because it is so popular. I did find it interesting and in my youth I spent a lot of time in New York City and had been to some of the places referenced in the story. When I was a kid growing up on a dairy farm, my cousins and friends and I used to play hide and seek in the cornfields, (Catcher in the Corn) way before we ever heard of Catcher in the Rye. So While reading this book I felt those kind of connections, as in, I felt like I was there in the story at times. But back when I first saw the title Catcher in the Rye, I imagined, (before reading), that it must have been about something in life to watch out for, something that may catch you if you let your guard down, something that might be out to get you. Maybe that's the connection Chapman made. Maybe Chapman didn't actually read the book before he killed. I just hope they keep the guy locked up.     And I, for one, hope they finally get finicky J.D.'s novel made into a movie. By the way, I think it is very healthy to turn off the TV and read books in quiet solitude.

During that time I was still accquiring my taste but something just didn't sit right with me and Holden. It is interesting (at least to me) that I find this book way better now that I am somewhat older and rather exeperienced in literature.<br /><br />What seemed than as boring, uninteresting, endless bragging about nothing now revelaed itself as carefully structured novel wich is full of life, sometimes the real life, which lies outside the borders of language, sometimes paper life of imaginary characters but life nevertheless.<br /><br />I read this first time in translation (Croatian) and it is not possible to say how much is lost in it. This slang of Holden's that came from the mid forties and which I find so peculiar when reading ol' Stan Lee's comic books, really has a function here.<br /><br />We are able to see struggle in text itself. One can observe everlasting change, one can feel with Holden on empatical level or one can observe Sallingers hand which puts him in solutionless positions and logical inadequacies.<br /><br />It is not the kind of bildungsroman that you may be accustomed to from German authors. There is no message which must be relayed to the audience. At least no explicit one. Sallinger experiments to extent that it's almost scarry.<br /><br />Maybe, from the today point of view this book can be viewed as \\""corny\\"" (to use the word from it) and it may not be able to relate itself to modern audiences which is accustomed to different type of literature. Maybe one can view it as oversimplistic, old, batterd or whatnot.<br />All that doesn't speak trully for this book. Sallinger's effort to weave the tale (which he is doing extremely well) can be observed on every step. And this observation leads you to interesting readings of this book that are very often overlooked, but they themself make this one a true classic recommendable to all ages, from 7 to 77.",2007-07-25

That same day, my own mother turned [ edited for delicacy's sake ].  So, Holden and Mom share the same birthday.  That just kills me, if you want to know the truth.  Anyway, I don't think they're related.  But if they are...well, that would explain a few things about my character.<br /><br />And let me take a moment to explain something about my character.  You probably don't give a good goddam about my character.  I'm just a micro-blip on the computer screen of your life, and that's fine, it really is, but I think, and please correct me if I'm wrong, I think I speak for a lot of people when I say I never read The Catcher in the Rye.  Not until July 16 in the Year of Our Lord Two-Thousand-and-One, that is.  On the occasion of Holden Caulfield celebrating a half-century of shelf-life, I finally introduced myself.<br /><br />That's right, ladies and germs, if my literary life had been a tabloid headline, it would have screamed:<br />I WAS A 38-YEAR-OLD CATCHER VIRGIN!<br /><br />\\""I don't know how it happened really.  One day, I was fifteen and reading everything I could get my hands on--John Updike, Saul Bellow, Erich Segal--page after page, book after book.  Complete and utter lack of self-control.  I was [sob] a library slut.  And then, I turned around, and I was grown up--a saggy past-his-prime man who'd never read J.D. Salinger.\\""<br /><br />I always wondered what the fuss was all about.  What was in this book--that paperback edition I'd seen so often with the orangey-red cover and simple yellow-lettered title--what was it, exactly, that I was missing?  And how had I let so many opportunities to read it pass me by?  I consoled myself with the fact that I personally knew some highly-educated people--good, honest people with sheepskin degrees on their walls--who had never ever read Moby Dick (the losers!).<br /><br />It's not like I grew up in a close-minded community (don't let the fact that I'm from Wyoming fool you).  No, I could have put my sweaty-slick teenage hands on Catcher at any point during my Acne Years.  Certainly my 10th-grade teacher--the balding, beak-nosed man from Alabama--the same one who had an unpublished novel called \\""The Scatological Implications of Brick-Laying\\"" sitting at home in his top desk drawer--that teacher of mine was progressive enough to have assigned the book to our class.  But he didn't.  Which is curious.  He is, after all, the one who encouraged me to read Updike's Rabbit, Run, which is sort of like Holden Caulfield, the Later Years if you want to know the truth.<br /><br />No, the truth is, I have no one to blame but myself.<br /><br />But whatever the reason for my virginity, I feel I have to be openly honest with you, the anonymous you floating out there in cyberspace.  Just so you see all my cards on the table here in front of us.  I come to you with no extra baggage, no wild-eyed, drool-lipped ravings of \\""I've read Catcher twenty-eight times, forward and back, upside and down, and I can recite any passage to you at the drop of a hat--go on, pick a page, any page.\\""<br /><br />No, no, none of that life-long fanboy stuff from me.<br /><br />I won't sit here and tell you J.D. Salinger first introduced the world to Holden Caulfield in two short stories, \\""I'm Crazy\\"" and \\""Slight Rebellion off Madison,\\"" which were published in periodicals during the 1940s.  You probably already know that.<br /><br />And I won't bore you with the fact that Time magazine called The Catcher in the Rye a \\""tough-tender first novel\\"" or that The New York Times loved Holden's narration, calling it his \\""own strange, wonderful language.\\""  Or that the book, beyond anyone's expectation, rocketed up the bestseller list and stayed there for seven months.  Or that the title comes from a Robert Burns poem (\\""if a body meet a body coming through the rye,\\"" though Holden thinks it's \\""catch,\\"" not \\""meet\\"").  You probably know that, too.<br /><br />Nor will I ramble on and on about the censorship--how Australian customs officers impounded a shipment of the book in 1957; or how, a year later, Catcher in the Rye was displayed on a \\""Smutmobile\\"" parked in protest outside the state capitol in Oklahoma City; or how it was banned in school districts throughout the 1960s and 1970s and how, as recently as 1992, school libraries in Iowa and Florida took it off the shelves due to its cursing and \\""lurid passages about sex;\\"" or how Salinger one day in 1953 just up and retreated to Cornish, New Hampshire and, as Amazon.com states, \\""hasn't published a syllable since 1965\\"" or how the novel had its darkest hour in 1980: on the evening when Mark David Chapman fired five bullets into John Lennon, then pulled Catcher of his coat pocket and sat down to read.  You know all that.<br /><br />No, I'm simply going to tell you how I, a slump-shouldered man of nearly four decades, approached the book with the quivering pink tenderness of a first-time reader of 15.  No prejudice.  Very little preconceived notions.  And a Moby Dick-sized anticipation.<br /><br />Now, I crack open my 1951 hardbound edition (no dustjacket, plain black board cover, arthritically-cracking spine, deckle-edged pages, faintly yellowed, sniff the pages and they smell like fifty years of back shelves in bookstores).<br /><br />Now, I read.<br /><br />Now, I finish, look up at you and say (voice fluttery at the edges): \\""It's goddam good.\\""<br /><br />Reading Catcher in the Rye--especially the first time--is like sitting astride a galloping horse.  You bounce and jounce, you make that funny uhn-uhn-uhn sound, you lose your breath then catch it again.  In the end, all you can do is grab tight those deckle-edged pages and hold on for the 277-page-ride.<br /><br />Here, for instance, is how Salinger bursts out of the starting gate:<br /><br />If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.  In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them.  They're quite touchy about anything like that, especially my father.  They're nice and all--I'm not saying that--but they're also touchy as hell.  Besides, I'm not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything.<br /><br />That's jet-propulsion writing if I've ever seen it.  As they say in the movies, \\""He had me at lousy childhood.\\""  I was hooked like the trout that swallowed the caddis fly.  But that's the thing about Salinger, see.  One sentence moves you to the next and the next and there is rarely a time when you want to stop, look up, then decide to put the book down and go do household chores.  The laundry can burn and the dinner can go unfolded as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />Holden's is a simple voice, a voice full of angst and self-pity and frustration and depression.  And yeah, profanity.  That stuff kills me.  Not to get on a soapbox or anything, but Holden Caulfield swears because, as John Lee Hooker said, \\""it's in him and it's got to come out.\\""  His profanity is not there for shock effect; it's an expression of his rage against the system--the mindless, do-as-they're-told masses.  Those slump-shouldered gobs of humanity (like you and me) tend to get all squirmish around Holden and his fierce independent spirit.  Four-letter words are both his sword and shield against their conformity--Holden uses \\""goddam\\"" to slash and protect.<br /><br />So maybe you're out there in cyberspace, mouth-breathing all over your monitor, and you're wondering what exactly I'm talking about because you, like the former me, are a Catcher virgin.  It's okay.  Nothing to be afraid of.  Stay calm and everything will be all right.  We'll get through this, you and I.<br /><br />The first thing you need to know about the book's plot is this: nothing happens...and yet everything happens.  It's that simple.  Salinger takes us on a journey through 48 hours of one boy's life as he gets kicked out of Pencey Preparatory School (\\""molding boys into splendid, clear-thinking young men\\"").  He's flunking every class but English.  This is just before Christmas, so you can just imagine what this must do to his peace-on-earth-goodwill-to-men spirit.  He decides to ditch the last couple days of school and heads for home where he hopes to say good-bye to his much-loved younger sister Phoebe before he heads out West where it's pretty and sunny and nobody'd know him and he could pretend to be a deaf-mute.<br /><br />That's it.  That's the \\""action.\\""  Over the course of those 48 hours, the sixteen-year-old Holden fights, smokes, drinks, hires a prostitute (unconsummated) and writes an English composition about a baseball glove.<br /><br />Through it all, there's his voice.  Oh, what a voice.  Salinger builds the book based on the cadences of language.  Every \\""anyway,\\"" every \\""boy,\\"" is carefully calculated according to the Principle Law of Staccato and Repetition.  Holden is a drumbeat on our ears.  pocketa-pocketa-pocketa<br /><br />Holden reminds us of every anguished teen we've ever seen.  James Dean.  Go Ask Alice.  The Breakfast Club.  Young Elvis.  Ponyboy and the Outsiders.  Those snap-fingered kids from West Side Story.  Maybe--no, probably--Holden reminds us of the slightly-confused person who used to stare back at us from the mirror years ago.  Holden's just trying to find his place in the world.  Aren't we all?  Isn't there just a little bit of Caulfield in each of our spleens even now?<br /><br />\\""Did you ever get fed up?\\"" Holden asks a girl he's taken out on a date.  \\""I mean, did you ever get scared that everything was going to go lousy unless you did something?\\""<br /><br />The funny thing is--or the sad thing, if you want the truth--Holden, for all his talk and bravado, never does strike out West, but ends up taking his sister Phoebe to the park where he watches her ride the carousel--a ride that goes around and around but never gets anywhere.  But yet there's always the promise of the prize.<br /><br />The thing with kids is, if they want to grab for the gold ring, you have to let them do it, and not say anything.  If they fall off, they fall off, but it's bad if you say anything to them.<br /><br />And so, on the one hand at least Holden is a bit more self-aware by page 275.  On the other, he's not the most perfect of travel guides through the razor edge of life.  His reliability is called into question early in the book.  Chapter Three begins:<br /><br />I'm the most terrible liar you ever saw in your life.  It's awful.  If I'm on my way to the store to buy a magazine, even, and somebody asks me where I'm going, I'm liable to say I'm going to the opera.  It's terrible.<br /><br />But we stick with him anyway (if nothing else, to find out what is real and what is conjured from the thicket of his mind).  It's impossible to resist the pull of his voice.  He is the moon, we are the tide.<br /><br />So, now you've come this far with me.  I hope you're not expecting a goddam medal or anything.  If you're anything like me, you're drippy with sweat and you have to pee really badly.  Well, tie a knot in it Junior, 'cause I've got just a little more to say to you.  Yeah, you, the mouth-breather who's leaning too close to the computer monitor.  (That kills me.  It really does.)<br /><br />Listen, I can't say this any other way:  If you read only one book this year, read The Catcher in the Rye.  If you were lucky enough to have someone force it down your pink quivering throat back in the Acne Years, fine.  Fine and jim-dandy.  But if it's been years (decades, even) since you sat down with your tatter-covered, dog-eared copy, well then you know what you need to do.<br /><br />And if you're one of those poor schmucks who's managed to make it this far in life without your eyeballs rolling across Salinger's pocketa-pocketa prose...<br /><br />Well then,<br />it's about time.<br /><br />Oh, and Happy Birthday, Holden, you old so-and-so.othing happens...and yet everything happens.

What I find remarkable is that the character Holden Caulfield still remains vibrant and meaningful. Why is this? I'm not sure. Maybe that is what makes this such a well read classic. I recognize in both readings the strong realistic style of writing the author uses. As a teenager I struggled with reading, always wanting to read but not being able to concentrate.

Salinger's novel revolves around Holden Caulfield, an angry teenager who feels he has nothing going for him in a world that gets more superficial by the minute.  Ok, this book is totally awesome if you just want to vent.  Salinger does a great job in accurately portraying the pure anger and despair every teenager has sometimes experienced in his/her moody world.  But don't take this novel lightly.  Salinger didn't write this book merely to sympathize with the teenage world.  Rather, he has some crucial themes relating to a world that is unsympathetic and the power of healing and moving on. <br /> <br />Holden believes that the majority of what's going on in his life is on the verge of being worthless.  His happy life the way that he knew was shattered when his younger brother died of cancer.  The Caulfield family was destroyed.

This is my first chance to have enjoyed this novel. In fact, I'm glad I didn't read this at a younger age. I doubt I would have appreciated it as much.<br /><br />Some of the reviews here seem to concentrate on Holden's age, as though these are typical teenager feelings that Holden expresses. I think it's a bit more than that. In my late twenties, I can wholly relate to Holden's story. It's less, in my opinion, about a teenager coming of age and struggling with issues, thoughts, and feelings typical and common in that age group, and more about struggling with change. It's simply that at Holden's age is when we typically start this life long struggle. It's something that we all can relate to, it's entirely ageless. I'd wager that typically, the older we get, the more we can relate to Holden's internal struggles. The older we are, the more we've struggled with the same and find more and more to connect with in Holden's story.<br /><br />Take a look at the way Holden views his younger brother. In his mind, he was near perfect. He didn't change; he was exactly as he always had been in his memory, suspended in time. But everything else in Holden's life was in a whirlwind, even his sister. At one point, Holden even felt he hated her.<br /><br />Holden's vision of himself, the catcher in the rye, seemed a fitting expression of wanting to keep things as they are, safe and stable. He felt as though he was standing on the precipice of that cliff and was powerless to keep himself and everything around him from falling away. At Holden's age, everything around you starts to change dramatically. From your understanding of the world, your outlook, people's expectations of you, even your body, the list goes on. The world seems different because it is different through the eyes of an adult, and from there on out, it just keeps evolving. You just keep falling over the edge.",2007-06-09

Salinger <br /> <br />What exactly is The Catcher in the Rye?  I suppose it's a not-quite-coming-of-age novel, an exploration in alienation, and a post-Freudian experiment.  It's also a collection of ramblings from an unreliable narrator.  But the digressive and repetitious nature of its language often reads like poetry, not prose; the cadence of the narrative has chips on both its shoulders.   <br /> <br />I've read some reviews referring to The Catcher in the Rye as \\""dated.\\""  There's some truth to this.  For example, today's teens may not be able to relate to a world populated by phone booths.  I know when I read about Holden Caulfield wearing a shirt and tie, I think of some fantasy America before my parents were born.  But the themes are not dated.  Last I checked, teens still have hormones and are in a constant search for alcohol.  They still have problems with girls/boys and with their own emotions.  They often feel dark and do dark things.  The props might be different, but the teen's world hasn't changed much in fifty-six years. <br /> <br />Perhaps the most dated aspect of the book is its great writing.  There isn't much edge and style to popular writing today.  Harry Potter has taken over the minds of far too many kids, young adults, and adults.  Yet if you were to compare the quality of the writing in The Catcher in the Rye to that of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, you would find the latter laughable.  At least, I hope you would. <br /> <br />For me, the best aspect of The Catcher in the Rye is its sustained style.  When I read it, I feel a master of language at work.  When I read a contemporary bestseller, I am often entertained, but I'm rarely challenged.  I consume these books and then discard them, never to look at them again.  With The Catcher in the Rye, Salinger has done something unprecedented and fresh.  He shows his readers that new writing is still possible, that writing is a craft to be honed and studied.  When entertainment and craft come together as well as they do in The Catcher in the Rye, literature is born and reborn.  That's what makes this book an indispensable classic and not a disposable piece of genre fiction.",2007-05-31

The book is deceptively simple due to the believably juvenile narration of the protagonist, 16-year-old Holden Caulfield. I immensely enjoyed the flavor of some of the retired teenage lingo of days gone by and felt as though the book was in fact an entertaining--if not long-winded--story told aloud around a campfire by the teen himself.<br /><br />There are several predominant themes integrated into the teen's ranting and wanderings which give depth to what some might perceive to be a shallow and boring tale about an angst-filled teen and his mundane existence at a college prep school in the mid-twentieth century. The most interesting of these to me, and what seemed to me to make his character convincing, is the somewhat hypocritical yet passionate stance Holden takes against what he calls \\""phonies\\"" throughout the story. The duplicity he observes in the people around him irritates him and arouses in him a kind of self-righteous distain, even though the faults he condemns are blaringly evident in his own life. I can relate to this speck-in-your-brother's-eye kind of vision of the world. More than anything though, it seems that Holden in justified in his cynicism because he recognizes his faults and condemns others more for their self-deception than for their phoniness.<br /><br />Holden also has a sensitivity to the true meanings of over-used words and phrases, which I find appealing. He condemns the use of the word \\""grand\\"" as excessive, and the wishing of \\""good luck\\"" ill-fated. He is a lover of the truth--even in his own delusion--and words to him should say what they mean. I agree, and his insight made me empathize with his struggle and love him as a character.",2007-04-17

His settings are wonderful and conjure up a NYC not quite in touch with itself, just as Caulfield found.

You can see why so many people who have felt troubled at all relate to him so dearly.  I read in wonder at points as it felt the character had stolen some of my own thoughts, decades before I was ever born.  His conflict with the world not living up to what one would hope, or people being \\""phony\\"" as he would put it is a comforting notion to the disenfranchised person, making one sense that they are not alone in the internal conflict presented by such a issue.<br /><br />Of course, Holden also seems to conflict with himself, which is another classic issue of youth.

The allure to Salinger's classic, then, is in its contrary mood and anti-establishment tone.  Holden has little patience for most anybody and can pick up a phony on his \\""radar\\"" from a mile away -- a gift many teenagers share when it comes to the adult world.<br /><br />Readers tend to fall into two camps regarding Holden.  One camp, the majority, holds him as an endearing rebel with a regrettable depression problem that grows as the novel unwinds.  The other camp, an admittedly sizable minority, holds him as an annoying whiner who complains about everything and gets nowhere in life (as you'd expect).  Clearly Salinger intended readers to tune into the former, and if you embrace Holden in that spirit, you will personally gain something from his travels through New York and realize that, deep down beneath all his cynicism and sarcasm, Holden really does care -- too much, in fact -- and has a code he not only lives by but judges others by.<br /><br />While there are no end to the characters Holden criticizes, take note of those he respects as well.  Old Jane Gallagher with her kings in the back row (checkers).  The nuns at the sandwich bar.  The little girl with the loose ice skates.  Phoebe and Allie.  For readers feeling hostile to Holden (or to a teacher who has assigned this book and thus changed it by putting it under a microscope or assigning pop quizzes about it), I suggest going out of your way to look for these positives.  You'll see that Holden is incredibly sensitive and ethical, can be sentimental about others, cares about women and girls, and understands right from wrong.<br /><br />Read in that spirit, the book can't help but be viewed as a modern classic saying as much about the world as it does about teenagers.  If you've ever caught yourself wondering about some really strange (and unique!) things like where the ducks in Central Park go in the winter, then you'll identify with this lost soul in search of life's meanings.<br /><br />This is Salinger's best in my opinion.

It depicts a frustrated and confused boy, nearly a man, who is at that pivotal point in his life where he must decide to either enter adulthood and participate in society, or turn his back towards society and live exclusively in his own mind.   <br /> <br />Holden Caulfield has just been expelled from school for failing his classes and decides to wander around New York instead of tell his parents the news.  The reason he failed isn't that he's not capable of passing his classes --he is a very intelligent boy -- but that he doesn't want to pass them.  He is frustrated at everyone around him, particularly the \\""phoniness\\"" he observes in their interactions with each other.  Holden is an extremely perceptive teenager who criticizes nearly everything he comes in contact with.  At first, I chuckled at his observations and I could easily relate to them as my own, however, as this consistently critical attitude continued to play out throughout the story, I found myself becoming more and more annoyed with them.  I started to realize that this boy was dealing with more than just some minor annoyances in his life, but that he was dealing with depression, loneliness, and a debilitating outlook on life.  He was a loner, and the more he chose to listen to his \\""inner voice\\""; as opposed to his teachers and mentors that try to help throughout; the lonelier and more isolated he becomes.    <br /> <br />There are many issues that Holden is dealing with in this book from his confusion as to \\""why are people the way they are?\\"", to his desire to just give up and isolate himself from humanity, to the distress he feels at the loss of his beloved brother, to his longing to preserve his sister's innocence so she won't have to face the realities of life.   As the books progresses, I found myself feeling more and more sympathetic towards Holden.  I began to understand his frustration and anxiety about leaving adolescence and entering the surreal world of adulthood.  Towards the end of the book, there are several moments where you realize he knows the severity of his decision; the decision either to find out who he is (find out \\""what size mind he has\\"" as one of his teachers said), or to fall into oblivion, never to be heard from again.  <br /> <br />There is no wonder why \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" is one of the most read books of our time.  This little book packs inside some of life's most important lessons and is told in assessable and relatable terms.

Everyone will have an ah-ha moment when you realize it, which makes it feel like the character has changed, even though he hasn't. <br /> <br />Holden, the main character, views himself in one light.  He aspires to be a savior or at least lead a life that preserves some kind of innocence or humanity in the world.

Every adult or peer is a \\""phony\\"" in one way or another, and only children still have that innocence.   <br /> <br />The other characters in the book view him in a different light.

Holden tries to hide his youthful innocence as he mirrors the habits of other adults, going to bars, drinking, and purchasing prostitutes. However, his bickering and sarcastic attitude suggest a hidden desire to stay young, a desire he stubbornly buries beneath his new, mature lifestyle.

Holden Caulfield is lonely and does not belong to any particular clique. He deals with a vanishing childhood that leaves him unhappy and depressed. Through his critical and often times cynical sarcasm he comes across many experiences that teach and mold him into a more mature individual. He is forced to leave behind his childhood and juvenile ways. After being kicked out of Pencey Prep Holden is sucked into the adult lifestyle. Because he is tall and portrays an older imagine Holden is able to blend into his new surroundings. Though he might seem like a delinquent, he still has loving and caring feeling towards his sister and dead brother. Irony plays a great role in this book because Holden accuses many of the people he encounters as \\""phonies\\"", but he himself is a phony at heart. As the story unfolds, Caulfield is faced with many hindrances he must overcome. His interest for the opposite sex grows as he matures, though he is unable to be with the girl he desires. Holden must learn that criticism is just another form of self doubt, because one can only be content with themselves if they are first satisfied with their others and their environment.

I tell you \\""g dam\\"" is everybody's favorite word in this book. Anyway, my tongue in cheek review would become tedious, so I'll play it straight.    Despite its popularity, The Catcher in the Rye was never a book I had to read in high school or college. So, I took it upon myself to read it for pleasure simply because I enjoy reading.     In the beginning I thought I would hate Holden Caufield. He is vulgar-mouthed,  and at times, a silly guy. You can tell very early on there is something \\""off\\"" about him. But there are a few things that make him endearing to me: he has a heart; he is unintentionally humorous; he despises phonies and cruelty; and he craves a return to innocence. Like me, he is disgusted by the actions and ways of humanity. He sees the world as a trivialized, bull-sh-it world, and I have to agree with him. In a word, he's a misanthrope; but is he a justified misanthrope?    My problem with Holden is in my realization that he is a nonconformist because he can afford to be. If Holden were a minority and/or poor, he would have to play by the rules of the world in order to simply SURVIVE. But because Holden is a white male in the Fifties, and has a rich corporate lawyer father, he has the luxury to be lazy, uninterested, and detached from the world around him without suffering any serious consequences.     This reality makes Holden less of a hero and more of a spoiled brat whose problems are trivial and whose outlook on life would be very different if he could trade places with someone less fortunate than him for a couple of weeks. Instead of cheering him for his nonconformity, we should jeer him for his blatant stupidity. There is an obvious difference between refusing to conform to rules that hurt you and refusing to conform to rules that help you. Ifeverybody is wearing blue and I show up in orange, I'm being a clever nonconformist. But if my nonconformity includes flunking out of school and damaging my chances at leading a successful life, then I'm simply an idiot.    But he is an idiot we can still empathize with and even root for. This is a sign of great characterization. Of course, we spend the entire book with Holden, so there's really no excuse for not knowing/liking him very well.    Bottom Line: A good, breezy book that I would put on the same level with To Kill A Mockingbird. Like Mockingbird, the love people have for it is more explanatory of its popularity than its actual technical greatness. It's a book that may still speak to many, but it's not necessarily a mind-blowing literary achievement. But, hey, it's Winona Ryder's favorite book (for whatever that's worth). And if you've seen Heathers, then you know underlining passages from it can be a sign of suicidal tendencies.",2006-11-01

Perhaps the fact that nothing like this had ever been written before was what made it intriguing, but nowadays, when teenage angst is splattered all over the internet, that's not particularly interesting or drawing. When you look a little deeper into the book, you find that Holden is a troubled teenager. The book, in all honestly, simply follows him around for a few days, gives us an image of what sort of person he is, and then ends. It follows through him trying to be an adult, trying to be a child, and then moping around for a bit. Any 15 year old could say the same.<br /><br />If it was simply angst, it still might be okay, but unfortunately, where Salinger could have saved this book, he destroyed it. There's absolutely no plot! It's a day in the life of a horny teenage boy who doesn't know what he wants with his life. While, yes, Salinger added some \\""pretty\\"" and meaningful parts (the title comes from one such moment where the book feels thoughtful and reflective, but really has no point, though it is a rather nice moment), and while perhaps Salinger is a good writer (this is the first book of his I've read, and to be quite honest, I don't feel any inclination to read another), \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" is neither truly well-written, nor is the plot good enough that I could call it good through that road.<br /><br />I didn't actually find \\""Catcher\\"" dull, as many other people do.

Okay, fine. It's in there. I laughed a couple or three times, and I even recall a good belly laugh. Good. And obviously there is Salinger's gift for spoken language and keen insightfulness regarding social peccadilloes and irritating manners. Most folks can identify with Holden's exasperation and frustration toward those who adapt to and adopt those \\""socializing\\"" manners and peccadilloes as they transition to adulthood. Holden seeks to resist that polluting influence, which is admirable, right?    Only, there's a problem. In spite of his recognition of the problem(s) in others, he is part of the problem himself. He candidly admits that he has a variety of personality quirks and negative behavioral characteristics. But he also has irksome and annoying behaviors that he doesn't recognize, and so his conduct contributes to the same noisome and spoilsome social corruption that he laments in others.    This book has a tremendous fan base. It is beloved as a cultural and literary artifact. It is also praised for its dialog and characterization, and rightly so. The story is skillfully presented, no doubt. Superlatives are tossed about (notice the terms \\""genius\\"", \\""master\\"", and \\""brilliant\\"" in the gushing spotlight review dated July 21,2000) when this novel is discussed. I understand why this is so, but I find myself tending to agree in sentiment with the tone of the one-star review below by Michael Atkins. This book is over-hyped. While Caulfield's character may ring true in both voice and observation, the result is a confection that is light in substance. Holden is a study in sweet angst, yes. So?    The theme of the book isn't related to the word picture captured in the title, contrary to the regurgitated observations made below. The theme is that humans are broken, and while they may be able to see what is wrong, they aren't much capable to do anything about it. Even if they can act to resolve a problem here or there, they are instigating and engendering their own set of problems elsewhere.    The musician Sting authored the popular song \\""Every Breath You Take\\"" while a member of the band the Police. He has voiced his consternation at the way the public responded to his song, which was #1 on the music charts for some time. Sting points out that the song is not about sweet, devoted love at all, but is rather about an obsessed and ugly jealousy that is controlling and disturbed. The public was happily and haplessly ignorant of this, naively not picking up the clues in the song or the video, even though the high-key, low-fill lighting used in the video gives a classic noire, deep-shadow depiction of a character with a dark side. Sting has often confessed his exasperation with the public's inability to recognize the song for what it is, and he finds the song's great popularity as a wedding song shocking and shallow.    The same is true of The Catcher in the Rye. As the other spotlight review by Jack from Des Moines illustrates, readers typically tend to identify with Holden Caulfield. Jack's statement is sterling: I AM HOLDEN CAULFIELD. \\""The number of readers who have been able to identify with Holden and make him their hero is truly staggering,\\"" claims the SparkNotes.com website. The ironic fact is that Holden Caulfield is one of the most pathetic and self-deluded characters in English-language fiction. He is, in his own wrecked way, as much a phony as any of the other characters upon whom he appends that label. Holden is everything he despises, despite his limited recognition of his own failings. For any reader to make the choice to happily identify with Holden Caulfield is to embrace in oneself the personification of foolishness. It is nothing less than gleefully claiming to be a phony. Look again at that SparkNotes quote above, then go figure.    My two-star rating is probably more a function of my reaction to the story's popularity, a la Sting, than my reaction to the humor and craft of the story itself. I would probably give the story three or four stars (3½ maybe?) based on those qualities. I would be willing to give the story five stars for it's superlative depiction of the inability of humans to recognize their own shortcomings while they so easily dwell on the failures of others, except for one thing: the evidence suggests that Salinger failed in making his point. In a tremendous irony, one perhaps not unexpected, readers on the whole appear to be incapable of recognizing the true theme and purpose of the story. It seems that hardly anyone learns from the novel, they just LIKE it. Reviewer Damon Garr, in his 5-star review below, even mourns that he wasn't quite as cynical when he was a teen as Caulfield manages to be in the story. How utterly bizarre!    Yes, people are Holden Caulfield...and what a sad, pathetic, shameful, and repulsive situation that is.

It has also been reviled, refuted, and banished from school reading lists since its publication in 1951.  So what's the big deal? <br /> <br />It's understandable that by 1950s standards this book may have been controversial, given its profanity and sexual underpinnings, although that is mild by today's standards.  However, these give the book an edge, and an extra dimension that helps catapult this book to the top of the list of classics.  Salinger presents the story of an adolescent, Holden Caulfield, and his alienation from the world he lives in.  Although there is little action, Salinger convincingly paints a portrait of a tortured individual struggling with irreversible changes in his life as he grows into an adult. <br /> <br />Although Holden is a privileged teenager from Manhattan, his life is anything but privileged.  Although he convinces himself that the world around him is full of \\""phonies\\"", his total self-isolation serves as a protective barrier against the world whom he loathes.  As he falls deeper into the abyss of self-pity and loneliness, it becomes apparent that a root cause of his present state of mind may be the death of his younger brother, Allie.   <br /> <br />Holden looks longingly back at his childhood, and is determined to preserve the innocence of his younger sister, Phoebe, the only one whom he truly cares about.  Indeed, his dream job would be a \\""catcher in the rye\\"", one who catches children as they play in a rye field before they fall over the precipice.  Symbolically, this is the precipice that separates childhood from adulthood, and the one that Holden is refusing to confront.  For once he descends into adulthood, he knows that his childhood is gone forever, and his memories of Allie will become distant. <br /> <br />There is a good reason this novel has become a staple of high school literature classes.  Although it is an easy read, it is also deep and profound.  And nearly all of us could relate to at least some aspects of the story. <br />",2006-06-14

I can see this point but I think this statement fails to indicate the multiple levels on which this amazing book plays.  The book follows the journey of the confused and disillusioned 16 year old Holden Caulfield from his expulsion from prep school to his journey home.  Along the way Holden meets a variety of characters which Holden discusses in his sarcastic worldly tone, which only serves to illustrate how innocent and confused Holden (and every adolescent)truly is.  Through the eyes of Holden, who is caught between his childhood and manhood, J.D. Salinger captures the moment in an adolescent boy's life to which almost every boy or man can relate.  But the purpose of this review is not to praise a book which has been  praised up and down but to recommend a book which can capture a teenage boy's imagination and interest where other books may fail.

He's going to a prep school and the name is not just meaning the name of the school. In Holden's eyes everyone is a fake, prep, or jock.     In the beginning of the story, which is from Holden's point of view, Holden is explaining how he's leaving the school because he has failed 4 of his 5 subjects. He goes to visit his aging teacher and meets up with his room mate. Turns out that his slimeball of a room mate is going on a date that day. On a date with a girl Holden knew from his past. He thinks about how he's is known as a player in the school and he worries for the girl.    In the end, after Holden leaves the school he takes an 'interesting' journey through the city. He meets up with some shady characters, while he's thinking about getting home to see 'Old Pheobe' his younger sister. He also thinks about his younger brother who had died. Along the way he seems to talk to himself, but in turn is really trying to have a conversation with his brother. His brother was the genius of the family and always seemed to know what to do, unlike Holden's older brother who has gone off to Hollywood where, in Holden's opinion, all the fakes live.    In the end this story is thought to be about a lot of things. Some people think that it's just the story of a messed up teen, trying to find his way home after getting kicked out of his 3rd school.

Roughly, the people I've encountered seem to put him into three categories: (1) the 'rebel with a lot of teen angst' category; (2) the 'annoying complainer' category; or (3) the 'funny and honest and extremely likable' category. Personally, I put him in primarily in the third category. To me, Holden Caulfield is a sensitive kid who's struggling to deal with the death of his brother while at the same time undergoing the confusing transition between childhood and adulthood. And all the while he's making honest observations that are often hilarious, depressing, or both. Granted, he probably fits into all three categories in one way or another, and on the exterior he definitely has a \\""who cares?\\"" attitude. But underneath it all I think he's motivated more by grief than by angst: he literally aches to connect with others, and he treasures the few moments when real connection becomes possible. Just look at the way he ends his story: \\""About all I know is, I sort of miss everybody I told about. Even old Stradleter and Ackley, for instance. I think I even miss Maurice. It's funny. Don't ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody.\\"" It's little glimpses like these that make Holden Caulfield one of my all-time favorite fictional characters.

First, a book you should have probably read in high school at some point.  Secondly, a classic by the nefarious recluse J.D Salinger.  Thirdly, a book that has been found on many a famous assassin or serial killer's bookshelf.  You buy The Cathcher In The Rye and some secret government agency puts your name on a list of possible homicidal maniacs or communist sympathizers or something.  Hmmmmmm.  Well.... I gotta tell ya, I never got around to reading Mr. Salinger's grand epic in high school, so I picked it up out of the sheer pleasure of reading another previously missed classic.  With mixed emotions, I began to read about the life and times of one Holden Caulfield.  Since it was originally published in 1945, 1946 & 1951, I caught onto the controversy right away.  People just didn't write books with a lot of swearing in them at that time.  Holden calls everthing goddam.  Holden has been ejected from Pencey prep school for flunking out of all his subjects except for English.  He is a rebel.  He is perhaps some sort of deviant loner.  He's definitely got some depression issues.  Bottome line, Holden Caulfield is a weirdo.  End of story?  Not really.  Holden mystifies his readers with his inane analysis of everything from phony people to little girls to jock roomates and life itself.  Moving?  Stiring?  In places, maybe.  He doesn't snivel and he doesn't want us feeling sorry for him, but all the same, you can't help but being just a little annoyed with his semi-retarded antics.  He smokes like a chimney.  He drinks like a fish.  He sneaks into his parents house to talk to his little sister Phoebe, who seems like a smart, but perhap strange little girl.<br /><br />Overall...The Catcher In The Rye is a readable book.  Nothing spectacular.  I'm sure the scholars would rebuke these statements, but I gotta tell ya, it wasn't anything special.  J.D. Salinger rambles on like a lunatic half the time and I'm sure it was not all for the mere literary effects.  Ho hum in places, but still managing to keep the reader interested.

Salinger captures the bitterly confused mind of a youth who hates the whole world not because the world is worth hating, but because he's frustrated at his own inability to get along in that world, with such crisp reality that it shocks far more than any fantastical American Psycho.  <br /> <br />Reading over the negative reviews on Amazon, I can't help but wonder how and why so many people are so unable to get it. The Catcher In The Rye is among the, if not the, most tangibly realistic looks into the mind of a disaffected, disillusioned youth suffering from depression (and a touch of the bipolar). The way Holden Caulfield's mind works is incredibly true to form - the contradictions, the hypocrisy, the confusion, the brief moments of sheer clarity followed by stretches of irrational thought. He thinks he's better than the world, and he thinks he's the lousiest person in the world at the same time. He wants everyone to go away and leave him alone, and he can't bear anyone, not even some schmuck he really dislikes (with good reason), to leave him. He's nothing but hypocrisy and contradictions and confusion. Salinger captures this in an amazing way. <br /> <br />People criticize the book because Caulfield is totally unlikable, a guy who rails against phonies when he himself is something of a phony ... but that's part of the point. Holden throws off all the signals someone in his situation actually throws off in real life, and just like real life, they're almost always ignored. Clearly this was a very, very autobiographical work for Salinger.  <br /> <br />There are several moments when Caulfield, narrating in the first person, mentions offhandedly that he began to cry, he didn't know why, he felt like dying, and suddenly it went away and he felt invigorated with energy. It rings remarkably true. Who wrote this stuff with such honesty in 1951? Who tackled these issues, and in such a manner, in the 1950s? <br /> <br />The reason this has impact, though, is not simply because of the subject matter, not because of what Holden Caulfield is going through, and not because of the context of its time, but because Salinger never plays it for melodrama. He doesn't talk it up with purple prose or romanticize Caulfield's mentality or beat you over the head with ham-handed messages and platitudes. He neither makes Holden's mentality seem \\""cool\\"" nor does he preach against Holden's attitude; he just says, \\""This is what it is.\\"" By presenting it in such a matter-of-fact manner, all in the first person, as if the narrator is simply telling you a story while having a few drinks, the whole thing is rooted in a very tangible, and therefore very disturbing, reality. <br /> <br />You and I KNOW Holden Caulfield. We've known that guy. And in The Catcher In The Rye, you get to peer inside his mind. <br /> <br />Even with dated references and slang and phrasings, I don't know that J.D. Salinger's The Catcher In The Rye will ever cease to be relevant and important.",2006-03-24

Salinger, was a book unlike any other book that I have read before.  This book has gained the attention and respect of many readers during the last few decades and there is no doubt that the book is famous.  Many people have claimed that this book has changed their lives and that it is a \\""must read\\"" for every teenager.  I, however, would like to disagree and I don't understand what the big deal is about this book. <br /> The book follows Holden Caulfield's life for a couple of days.  The story takes place in the short time period of less than a week and it starts off with Holden getting kicked out of another school.  Holden's brother had recently died and his life was changed forever.  After the death if his brother, Holden becomes more careless and adopts an \\""I couldn't care less\\"" attitude.  Holden pretends to talk to his dead brother and he must work out his very emotional problems and find his true identity through his careless, teenage life.  Holden doesn't care about his future or his life.   \\""Oh sure I feel some concern for my future, but not too much I guess,\\"" he said.  He spends his time drinking, swooning women and calling up prostitutes.  Not to mention his crude language. <br /> The other characters in the book where almost nonexistent.  Two main characters would be a stretch and every time a new character emerges, he is quickly tossed and forgot about by the next chapter.  Holden also has a habit of calling people phonies.  He really doesn't like the phonies in the book and sees them as degraded.  However, it never even occurs to him that he, himself, is a huge phony. <br /> Holden's true character emerges throughout the book.  \\""I'm quite illiterate, but I like to read a lot,\\"" he said.  Holden, at the end of the book, is quite a different Holden then at the beginning.  I guess I am not one of the people whose life has changed after reading this book.  It had bad language, butit was written in first person by a teenager, so it was easy to read.  However, by the end of the book, there were many questions that needed to be answered.  A main character, Jane, whom Holden is in love with, is well known throughout the first couple of chapters, but the book ends with no mention of Jane's whereabouts.  It was almost as if J.D. Salinger got tired of writing the book, so he decided to end it abruptly.  Holden's character totally transforms in the last couple of pages and it ends with Holden saying \\""That's all I'm going to tell about.\\""  The ending got me angry and the book had no plot.

The main character of this book is named Holden. The setting of this book is at Pencey, a boarding school that Holden attends. He describes the place to be very much like a modern day college. The school has dorms just like a college would. Pencey seems to be a very laid back place because the kids are allowed to go basically where ever they want, all they have to do is sign out. <br /> The Author of this book either new what people wanted to read about, or was very troubled. The characters in the book are very realistic. The author chose that the story would all be told through the eyes of the main character. Holden seems very normal at the beginning of this book. He thought much like any other teenager would think. As the book goes on Holden gets harder and harder to relate with Holden. He also gets very annoying in the book. He likes to describe things that don't normally get described down to the very last detail. Then things that you would like to read more detail about are slightly mention. This can make the reader very frustrated at times with the main character. Holden is also a very negative person and likes to talk behind everyone's back. Nobody really likes Holden, and everyone seems to be annoyed by him. Its easy to be annoyed by Holden, but he is a great character for this book. <br /> This was great and easy read. The book is all about Holden, a teenager who has flunked out of so many schools, and is now flunking out of his current school. He is very worried about telling his parents just like any other teenager would be.

He runs away to New York which is not to far away from his boarding school and has some strange experiences. This book is a very good book from cover tocover.

Also keep in mind that this book takes place in the early 1920's. Therefore the customs and ways of life are way different than they are today. The book is about a boy who doesn't really understand himself or anything that is happening in his life. It's about a teen that goes against his morals and values to try and figure out who he is. Through out the book the teenager experiences a lot of different situations. <br /> Holden is the main character in this book. In the book he is the one who narrates everything. He explains everything in great detail. You would think that being the character that he is, that detail wouldn't matter to him. Holden is a teenage boy who drops out of a school called Pency Prep. He decides to run away for a while, that way his parents can get over the shock of him leaving the prep school. Holden would have gone home, but this wasn't the first time he had dropped out of a school. <br /> Stradlater, Holden's roommate at Pency is a jock who Holden doesn't stop talking about. Stradlater seems to be the kind of guy who really likes to use girls. He goes out on a date with a girl named Jane, who Holden knew from his past when he used to live in New York.  <br /> Jane is the girl that Holden talk about a lot in the book. Jane and Holden used to be next door neighbors with each other.  Holden and Jane used to play checkers with each other in the summer.  <br /> The theme of this book is showing how an unmotivated teenager develops morals and values by finding himself through out the book. By figuring out what he wants to do and what he cares about, Holden finds himself.  <br /> Through out the book Holden travels to a lot of places. He is really confused and is embarrased and afraid to go home, because of what his parents will think. Holden tired to figure out who he is, and along the way he makes friend and he looses some. There are times in the book where he does care about things but then there are other times where it seems that he has no dignity and that he doesn't care about anyone, sometimes not even himself.  <br /> What really makes Holden change at the end of the book is that he goes home when his parents aren't there and visits his sister Phoebe. He talks to her and she tells him that she wants him to come home and stay home. Holden doesn't know what he wants to do. Phoebe makes a big impact on Holden at the end of the book and he makes a decision that he has to live with. But I think it's a pretty good one. <br /> At the end of the book things are solved but it doesn't really say what happens to the characters.  The author ends the book by having Holden say that he doesn't want to say anything else and that he doesn't want to tell you the rest of what happens.  <br /> I really disliked this book. The narration was really bad. I think that having Holden always contradicting himself made it really hard to understand what he did believe in. I also didn't like it, because the ideas in the book were really random. Holden goes from leaving his school, to getting drunk, to finding a prostitute, and then going to a museum with his younger sister. I think there were too many ideas in the book. So many that it almost made the book misleading. And another big thing was that there was too much swearing that occurred. There were nasty words that were said on almost every page in the book. I was told that this book was really popular, and still is, but I don't understand how a book that has really no ending to it could be called a classic. <br />",2006-03-14

Salinger took place in a very different setting then that of my life but some people may be able to relate to this.  New York in 1950 was very different from the world we know today.  Drugs were one thing that was looked upon differently.  The main character Holden smoked a lot, and he wasn't the only one.  Many of his friends smoked as well, and they're all around sixteen years old.  I couldn't believe even his parents did not care that his little sister had been smoking.  \\""I just lit one for a second.  I just took one puff.  Then I threw it out the window\\"" (177).  She doesn't even get in trouble for it and she is so young to be smoking. I think it's crazy how some people have no direction in life and they do not do anything about it.  It's almost as if they've given up in life already.  I think a lot of this book is about choosing a direction or path to take in life.  \\""Anyway I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all.  And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff.  What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff\\"" (173).  This is Holden talking about what he wants to do when he grows up.  Honestly I think you have to be mentally unstable for you to come up with this as your dream job.  This story doesn't really fit into a main genre of novels, but it could be considered inspirational, or uninspiring depending upon how you look at it.Holden is a very boring person, he leads a somewhat odd and interesting life in the way that's it different from mine and probably most other people.  He drags out his life though and he talks about the boring things in life and not what really matters.  Like for example \\""I got bored sitting on that washbowl after awhile, so I backed up a few feet and started doing this tap dance just for the hell of it.  I was just amusing myself\\"" (28).  Then he keeps going on about it for a whole page.  He complains about everything, he hates everything, and he is completely miserable.  The whole plot is about him running away from the things he hates.  There's no action and nothing exciting about the plot at all.  This book is sometimes difficult to read because it goes off on tangents about the oddest most worthless things that Holden thinks about.  He's always complaining as well, and it seems to give the book a sort of annoying feel to read.  Often times it was not an exciting story at all.  Actually to be honest it was never exciting to read.  The book gets the point across well but not in an entertaining way.  I really didn't enjoy reading this book.",2006-03-14

Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye is a story of an underachieving young man's coming of age after he is kicked out of a private school in Pennsylvania. The story's setting changes from Pennsylvania to New York in the mid 1940's, although Salinger doesn't focus on the setting as much as the main character, Holden Caulfield. Holden is a peculiar young man trying to find his place in life. He is extremely judgmental and over-analytical to almost everyone, and everything that he runs into. As soon as he meets someone, he automatically passes judgment on them. Although all of us do this to a certain extent, Salinger has him ramble on for pages and pages about seemingly pointless subjects. He does this to such an extreme it almost becomes funny. Holden often refers to people as \\""phony\\"". Usually these people are conventional, average people, who conform to the boundaries of society, something that escapes him. Holden is not at all an average boy, and he seems to be disturbed in his mind, and has serious trouble following any rules, or being like anyone he thinks to be phony. He is afraid of growing up, and just being another boring adult. Holden seems to be hyper-sensitive to the hypocrisy and ugliness of the world around him, and within himself, making him an extremely disturbed and depressed person. I kind of feel sorry for the kid, he just cant seem to find his place in the world, even though he has failed out of four different high schools, he hasn't really found a place where he feels like he belongs. <br /> Salinger uses a very realistic writing style in Catcher in the Rye. Most of the vocabulary he uses is very typical of a 16 year old boy, using a lot of profanity and making you really feel like you are in the midst of young people having very genuine discussions. This  drew me into the story, really painting a picture in my mind, and helped me  relate to the characters. Reading Salinger's writing can get a bit aggravating though. Reading Holdenramble on a baseball mitt for three pages can get irritating, but when you finish the book, you realize those long lectures really meant something. <br /> Overall, I think that Catcher is a great read, and in the end, you really start to feel sorry for Holden. Catcher isn't your average novel, because it really has no ending. But it really makes you think about this young man's method of thinking and if he is crazy or just opens his eyes wider than the rest of us. I can see why this book is a great American novel, soI recommend it for anyone looking for a good laugh and a different perspective on the world. <br />",2006-03-13

Salinger, you should keep in mind that it takes place in the late forties. Customs and the way people go about things were very different than they are now. Or, maybe it's just the way Holden, the main character, reacts to the events in his life. <br />        The Catcher in the Rye is about a seventeen-year-old boy, Holden, who drops out of prep school, without telling his parents. This leads to him hanging around New York City in the days preceding Christmas break. He is your typical rebelling teenage boy. He tends to use lots or crude language and enjoys rather large amounts of drugs and alcohol. Some common phrases Holden uses are: \\""For Chrissake\\"", \\""Wuddaya mean what the hell am I doing?\\"", \\""Jesus! What the hell happened to you!\\"", \\""That depressed the hell outta me\\"", and \\""Goddamnit!\\"". Although, when faced with the opportunity for a prostitute he takes it, but when she arrives, he can't bring himself to commit the act. That seems to be the only real commendable thing about Holden. The only other thing that I liked about this book was the relationship Holden had with his younger sister, Phoebe. Here is a quote that shows how Holden cares for Phoebe. \\""I'm going with you. Can I? Okay? Please.\\"" \\""No. Shut up. You're not going. Now, shut up.\\"" This is the part where Holden decides he is going to go out west and Phoebe wants to go with him, but he won't let her. This caring feeling that Holden has for Phoebe also comes through in other parts of the book.   <br />At the end, problems are solved, but not in a reasonable or logical manner. <br />I didn't get much of anything out of this book at all. There's really no lesson learned, point or objective and not much of a happily ever after either. Personally, this book could and should have lasted much longer. The author could have spend more time really getting to the bottom of Holden's problems and telling more about how things turned out for Holden. It just seems like he got tiredof writing the book and took the easy way out. The last chapter: \\""That's all I'm going to tell you about. I could probably tell you about what I did after I went home, how I got sick and all, and what school I'm supposed to go to next fall, after I get out f here, but I don't feel like it.

Salinger, told a story about how it is hard for a teenage boy to live on his own in NYC. Catcher in the Rye is an adventure book. It is an adventure book based on the aspect that Holden runs away and lives on his own in NYC. He goes to many places and meets new people and sees people he already knew. <br />J.D. Salinger had a very unique writing style for this book. J.D. writes as if he was a teenage boy who has a lot of trouble in school. He swears a lot.

I think that it was a good style of writing for this book. <br />  The book is about a kid named Holden Caulfield. Holden is a teenager who goes to a prep school called Pencey prep. Holden is the kind of kid who doesn't like school much. He doesn't get good grades because he doesn't care enough about school. Holden had already been failed out of some other schools before so it didn't come as a big surprise to him when he failed out of Pencey. Holden didn't have many good friends at Pencey that he liked anyway. He was a roommate with a kid named Stradlater who he thought was conceded and the only other kid that he was friends with was a kid named Ackley. According to Holder Ackley was an annoying kid who lived next door. In the book Holden says \\""about eighty-five times a day old Ackley barged in on me\\"" (pg 19). When Holden got failed out of Pencey he runs away. He decides to take the money that his grandmother gave him and to go stay at a hotel. Holden decides to go to a nightclub before he goes to the hotel. He tries to order a soda and some scotch but the waiter wont get it for him because he wasn't old enough. Holden get a scotch and soda. He just drinks and listens to conversations around him. He thinks that all the people there are \\""phony\\"". Then Holden sees Lillian Simmons, one of his brother's old girlfriends. When Holden talks about her he says she's \\""strictly a phony\\"" (pg 86). Lillian invites Holden to sit with her and her boyfriend. Holden says that he was just about to go. The Holden leaves and goes to the hotel. On his way up to his room the elevator boy, Maurice, asked Holden if he wanted to prostitute for $5. Holden says yes. When the prostitute comes all Holden wants to do is talk to her. Then when the prostitute leaves she asks for $10. Holden only gives her five. Then she leaves very upset. In the middle of the night Holden hears a knock on the door. It is Maurice and the prostitute. They say that Holden owes them five more dollars. Holden wont pay them so Maurice beats Holden up while the prostitute takes five dollars. Then they leave. After this Holden says that he wanted to commit suicide, but he didn't. <br /> Holden goes on in his adventure meeting up with many people including his old teacher who gives Holden a new impression of him.

Salinger's Catcher in the Rye was an interesting account of one point in the 17 year-old Holden Caulfield's life during the late 1940's. Holden is incredibly smart and witty character, who also has a soft sentimental side. Holden felt disinclined to apply himself in school and wanted to be independent. He was flunking out of Pency Prepatory in Angerstown, Pennsylvania and they finally kicked him out. He didn't like anything that went on at Pency so he really doesn't care that he gets kicked out. Then he desides to get on a train and go to New York. He spends some time in New York and discovers so much while he's there. He took a cab and went to the Edmont Hotel and got a room. Holden doesn't like this room at all. He discribed it as crumby. After deciding his room wasn't anything to stay in he goes down to the lobby and dances with some girls. The next day he checked out and snuck into his parent's apartment to see his siter Phoebe. He arranged to meet her in front of the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art. After seeing how upset she was that he was leaving he couldn't leave. In the end, Holden stays at home knowing he would be sent to another school in the fall. I really enjoyed this book because J.D. Salinger's writing isn't like any other. He gives Holden a really good sense of humor which is what I enjoy the most in a book. One thing in particular that bothered me was the fact that the setting wasn't really talked about but most of them were self-explanitory. The Catcher in the Rye is a great novel to read, espically if you are interested in American culture in the late 1940's. <br />",2006-03-08

The more I researched him, the less I liked him. <br /> <br />Is his writing very good? Not really. One of his college professors named him the worst writer in the history of the school. It's a very repetitive style. I give him credit for at least having a unique style - that plain, to-the-point narrative - but in my opinion, his short stories are FAR better than \\""Catcher in the Rye.\\"" <br /> <br />\\""Catcher\\"" is rather simplistic, and like \\""American Psycho,\\"" its point can be gathered within five pages. I prefer \\""Psycho\\"" simply because I find Ellis' similarly repetitive narrative more humorous and unpredictable - I liked the character Patrick Bateman even though I simultaneously despised him. I didn't like Holden at all. There has to be some kind of connection, and there isn't. <br /> <br />Salinger had a yearning for his own childhood. He experienced a lot of terror once he reached adulthood (including losing friends in WWII) and he idolizes childhood as a state of naivety and innocence (as seen in stories such as \\""A Perfect Day for Bananafish\\""). Unfortunately \\""Catcher in the Rye\\"" - his ode to his own childhood and the destruction of innocence - is a masturbatory effort that gathered a reputation for being controversial, and like many novels (yes, also \\""American Psycho\\"") elitist critics jumped on the bandwagon and began hailing it as an underappreciated American classic.

Salinger, truly took on the part of a troubled teenager in the book called The Catcher in the Rye.  The Catcher in the Rye is a very well known book.  It is enjoyed by many, but personally, not that much by me.  Salinger really made you feel what the troubled teenager was feeling.  This troubled teenager called himself Holden Caulfield.   <br /> The book starts off with Holden getting kicked out of school.  This is not the first time that he has been kicked out of school.  At the current school that he goes to, he dorms with an interesting character named Stradlater.  In the dorm next to him is a friend of his named Ackley.  Holden finds him to be even more interesting than Stradlater.  Holden said, \\""He was exactly the kind of a guy that wouldn't get out of your light when you asked him to.\\""  After he got kicked out of school, he went to his old history teacher.  This teacher appeared to be very wise and knowledgeable about the world around him.  He also cared a lot about Holden's future and questions him about what he is doing with his life.  He asked him, \\""Do you feel absolutely no concern for your future, boy?\\""  Holden thinks that it is just a phase that he is going through.  He said, \\""I'm just going through a phase right now.\\""  This \\""phase\\"" that he is going through doesn't stop any time soon. <br /> Holden decides that since he has already been kicked out of his current school, that he might as well leave.  This is where the true adventure begins.  Holden decides to travel to New York for awhile.  The thing  he doesn't realize is that he will find out a lot about himself on this trip and meet a lot of interesting people along the way.  Holden seems to always want to depend on someone throughout the book, but he ends up being independent.  Throughout the book you see him always wanting to talk with someone.  I would consider the book to be an adventure. The theme seemed to follow what a troubled teenager goes through. <br /> The Catcher in the Rye was an interesting book.  I liked how the author got into the part of Holden. You could really feel the troubles that Holden was going through.  The only problem was that at times the book seemed to get tedious.  Overall I didn't like the book too much.  At times the book hit a climax and got very thrilling, but for the most part it was boring.  I do think that the author did a good job, but the book didn't appeal to me.  <br />",2006-03-03

The most troubling part of this book is that Caulfield's thoughts both repeat and contradict themselves; this makes the prose style difficult to read. <br /> <br />I admire Salinger's ability to turn out a stream of conscious narrative of this type.  Few authors have this ability.  As a coherent novel, it works well, despite the jerky narrative (a hallmark of any true stream of consciousness novel).  The secondary characters seem brighter at times than Caulfield, a nice touch; I particularly liked Phoebe. <br /> <br />There is plenty of art to be dissected and meaning to be squeezed from this novel.  However, I would say that its full impact would likely be felt in the more tumultuous teenage years, rather than later as an adult.

This novel describes the period of everyone's life, when a teenager becomes an adult and begins to realize that the world is very far from perfect.  The main character, Holden, is from a rich family, which is trying to get him a decent education, but he does not understand the importance of an education and tries to live a dream life, not really thinking of the outcome. Holden has just dropped out of another college and goes to New York, to wait before his parents get the news. He basically wanders around the big city, trying to pass the time, and thinks about life. The author portrays New York in great detail, to add to the reader's understanding of what makes Holden different from the rest of the crowd.  <br /> Salinger describes the main character with surprisingly realistic accuracy by using word choice, and mainly the use of slang language. His carefully chosen words and phrases make the reader become a part of the book. Throughout the novel, the reader worries about Holden's future, and thinks about what would need to be done better in that situation. Also, Salinger uses examples from everyday life to show how the main character feels about each event; like going to the ice rink or to the movies or just walking in Central Park.   <br /> Overall, the book shows the reader that life is not just a bowl of cherries, and neither are the people in it, but not much can be done to fix it. It suggests that it's better to concentrate on making your life better instead of trying to fix others. This book can be read in about a week or less, and highly recommended as a must-read classic.",2006-01-10

Somehow I escaped that requirement and never read the book in high school, but I recently picked the book up for something to read on the long train ride into work each morning.  It turned out to be a good choice, and a book that I really enjoyed, though it took awhile for me to get into it. <br /> <br />The first problem was my own fault.  Somehow I had confused the book with \\""Lord of the Flies\\"", (which I also escaped from having to read in high school), and I kept waiting for Holden to somehow get stranded on an island in the Pacific.  Needless to say, the story of a confused teenage boy flunking out of college and reluctantly having to go home and tell his parents seemed a strange and slow start to the story of a bunch of boys stranded on an island.  When I finally got myself straightened out, the story started making sense, but it still seemed slow and monotonous.  Hearing this boy complain about every little thing was not grabbing me at all.  I wondered if making the book boring was done on purpose... to mimic the dullness of someone always complaining. <br /> <br />From what I've said so far, you would think that I hated the book, but slowly the plight of this young man began to touch me.  Beneath the constant grumbling and complaining was a kid feeling disillusioned, and not really knowing where to go with his life.  I was actually becoming interested in what was happening to this boy, and how he saw it.   <br /> <br />Catcher in the Rye is an odd book.  On the surface, the story can seem quite boring, yet some people really connect with it from the very beginning.  Some people don't seem to connect with it at all.  And for some, like me, it takes a little while to connect with the book.  I think those who do connect with the book, whether right from the start or after having read a ways into it, are those who recognize either now or somewhere in their lives a feeling of being lost or disillusioned...a confusing mix of apathy, bitterness, regret, anger, fantasy... feelings commonly felt by teenagers as they enter the world of adulthood, but feelings that anyone can feel at any time.  For those who connect with it, reading Catcher in the Rye is like a little light illuminating a part of us that we probably don't often see or wish to recognize, and in which one can learn to feel sympathy towards others (or ourselves) in such a place of emptiness. <br /> <br />If you decide to read this book, my suggestion is that you give it a chance.

The episode was about book burning and censorship in general. Catcher in the Rye was one of the books that was mentioned by name as inspiring hatred in some groups of people (along with Slaughterhouse Five, and a certain editions of the Dictionary which contained \\""dirty\\"" words).  Rossie (one of Lou Grant's star journalists) picked up Catcher in the Rye out of the pile and said he couldn't believe anyone would want to ban it, and that book helped him survive his teenage years.  Naturally after seeing the episode, I went out to the local Library to try and find and read all of these forbidden books for myself, to see what was so bad about them. <br /> <br />I read it at age 13, and just did not get it at all.  I mainly didn't understand what a \\""phoney\\"" was in the context that Holden Caulfield was using that word, and didn't understand how a person of his age could have so much freedom (to stay in a hotel on his own, wander around New York City on his own) and still do nothing but whine and complain. <br /> <br />We were assigned to read the book in my Sophomore year in high school, and even with the benefit of being two years older, I still didn't appreciate the literary value of it.  Holden was just a insufferable whiner in my opinion, and I couldn't identify with him whatsoever.  I decided it must be a baby-boomer thing. <br /> <br />It wasn't until I read \\""Less Than Zero\\"" by Brett Easton Ellis in the late 80's that I got a clue to why baby boomers loved Catcher in the Rye so much.  One of the reviews of Less Than Zero quoted on the back cover said \\""... this is a Catcher in the Rye for our time...\\"".  Less Than Zero was one of the most raw, shocking, disturbing books I had ever come across, and it made me think that maybe in the early 1950's when The Catcher in the Rye was published, it was raw, shocking and disturbing toaudiences at the time.  If that's the case, then I can understand why it holds a special place in the heart of baby boomers, and people from that generation. <br /> <br />Even so, Holden Caulfield will always be an insufferable whiner as far as I'm concerned.",2006-01-03

Although the book can be considered a tragedy (an underachieving adolescent's descent into mental collapse), the mood of the story is endearing and comical.<br /><br />Through Holden, Salinger captures adolescence at its most vulnerable and righteous. With Holden's untethered idealism comes a provocative cynicism that makes Holden my most beloved character in any novel ever. Holden's stream of consciousness dialect makes this book a masterpiece beyond any other \\""coming-of age\\"" story. Prone to hyperbole, Holden views everything in universals and extremes. He has a sense of idealism that has not been comprised by the sophistication of adulthood. Although he is quick to see hypocrisy in everything, he is not so quick to see dissonance in his own thinking. He challenges the authenticity of everything although he is the one searching for his own meaning. The result is a warped sense of righteousness that leads to his loneliness and subsequent breakdown.

Salinger that is a well known and loved story about a boy who is facing many hardships and problems as a 16 year old growing up in the 1950's.  What makes this coming of age book so popular even to contemporary readers is its characters and conflicts that can be easily related to by many. <br /> The story starts out with the main character Holden Caulfield being expelled from his fourth school after failing four of his five classes.  The trek back home 2 days before his family was expecting him starts his adventure of wandering the streets of Manhattan.  There he encounters a variety of people from old girlfriends to a prostitute before making it back home too ashamed to admit to his parents of being expelled. <br /> What makes The Catcher in the Rye such a good book is the character Holden and how the author portrays him.  He is easy to relate to in his troubles with life, sex, and personal conflicts, but what makes him unique is how he approaches situations.  For example, early in the book when Holden is on the train home to Manhattan, he is approached by a woman who had a son that went to school with him.  Though he didn't care for her son at all, Holden makes up stories about the boy of how well liked he was at their school just to see her reaction and to possibly make her happy though they were all lies.  He is quick to point out the hypocrisies of adults, and the people in which he viewed as \\""phonies\\"" all the while secretly wishing to retrieve the lost days of his childhood. <br /> The Catcher in the Rye is a book that all must read and experience.  It is better suited for an older audience, who can better relate to Salinger's words, and shouldn't be read just once.  It is a book that should be appreciated for its depiction of its characters and outlook on the world.   <br />",2005-10-31

That's what gets it two stars instead of one.  The descriptions approach stream of consciousness almost to the point of Kerouac's On the Road.  Unlike other forms of art, however, I believe a truly great novel should not just rely on uniqueness to become famous, but also has the responsibility of paying the reader back for the time invested in the reading.  The problem is that the story that follows does not have the strength to hold us the unique perspective because there really isn't much story at all.  Rather, it's a description of consecutive events over three days in the life of Holden Caulfield, who I never really found a reason to care about.   <br /> <br />Salinger, in my opinion, never really strikes any chord with the reader to make them care about his main character.  Sure, he's going through coming of age events, but so what, who doesn't?  The repetitive use of foul language and degenerative thoughts becomes very tired as we quickly get the point that Holden is a rebellious youth going through tough times.  It's too bad Salinger never does much with it.  It's like one of those long movies that you want to quit watching, but you're sure the director is about to make a point soon, so you keep watching.

Salinger creates a masterpiece about a 17 year old boy, Holden Caulfield, who has just been kicked out of a prep school and spends 24 hours in New York City.  J.D. Salinger's characters are well thought out and are probably some of the most complex and intriguing characters that I have ever come upon in my 12 year stint as a young man capable of reading.  Most everyone can relate to many of the feelings that Holden experiences during his stay in New York. <br /> Holden, a troubled young man who has an extreme compulsion to lie, has become my favorite character that I have ever read about.  As a seventeen year old myself, I can relate to many of his thoughts and actions.  As he takes his stroll around New York, he runs into many different people, most of which he does not seem to care for.  Many times he can be seen criticizing the people he runs into.  Salinger must have put much thought into Holden, in order to create such a picture perfect image of a teenager who is unhappy with the world around him.  Holden is compassionate and caring, yet he has many exterior resistances.  He does not want to become part of the crowd. <br />Holden is on the verge of adulthood, as am I, yet does not wish to become an adult.  He sees the corruption that has become New York and does not approve of it.  The world is full of liars, cheaters, and phonies; and he wants none of it.  I, myself, see much of the world like this and do not want to become a cog of the machine that is the corrupt world. <br /> Salinger's sense of symbolism is exceptional.  The main title of the book is a metaphor.  Holden is the catcher in the rye, and he wants to save innocent children from falling over the cliff at the end of the rye field into a world of hatred.  The title expresses the theme of the book, innocence must be saved.  Salinger makes you see the world as it really is, although his viewpoint is very cynical, I agree with it for the most part.  Salinger vividly expresses this theme throughout his book through symbolism, imagery, and other literary devices. <br /> Another symbol in the book is Holden's goofy hunting cap.  He uses it as a shield to protect his innocence.  He puts it on when he gets uncomfortable with the world around him.  There are many symbols in the novel that intrigue me. <br /> I would recommend this book to anyone, especially teenagers, as they will understand the reasoning of Holden more than any others.  Salinger creates a great piece of literature in the Catcher in the Rye, through his nearly perfect characterization and outstanding symbolism.  Holden has become my all-time favorite character.  I see him as almost a mirror image of me. <br /> <br />",2005-10-20

Native New Yorker Holden Caulfield didn't do much sleeping when he was there unannounced to his parents in December 1949 after getting thrown out of his preparatory school, in Pennsylvania. J.D. Salinger brings Holden's many personalities to life, as Holden slips slowly out of sanity in a matter of days which seems like an eternity to the reader. <br />  <br />Holden Caulfield is without a doubt the life of The Catcher in The Rye. So much so, it seems that his psyche is almost projecting the story onto a giant screen for all to see. Throughout the novel Holden always remains a constant. Other characters come and go and maybe be mentioned before and later, but it's Holden's account. This is what makes the book so great. It's written so that you can imagine what it's like to be Holden. Your perspective is enhanced because you're watching him as described by him, rather than from another person's point of scrutiny. <br />  <br />The novel starts out with Holden recounting everything while at the same time giving the reader important background info. Holden Caulfield is one of four children in the Caulfield family. Besides him there's his older brother D.B. Caulfield who he now regards as a \\""phony\\"" because of D.B's career choice in Hollywood. His younger brother Allie is one of the sources of his mental anguish. Allie died several years before the start of the novel and Holden often misses him. Last but not least is the youngest Caulfield Phoebe. Phoebe's the only sibling still at the family house in New York. Holden trusts Phoebe and is one of the few people he doesn't regard as a \\""Phony.\\"" Holden's interaction or non interaction with his family is something that you'll have to read about, and I can assure you it won't be boring or trivial.   <br /> <br />I think the best way I can describe this book's pace and level of excitement is by saying that Holden's adventure is always moving and never really seems to take a boring turn. Life as described by Holden's former teacher at Pency Prep. \\""Life is a game, boy. Life is a game that one plays according to the rules.\\"" Holden, as you'll see, lives up to that quote and plays his game to the fullest but struggles at the same time to control it.  <br /> <br />Like most other great novels. The Catcher in The Rye has its themes, symbols and consequences for actions taken by the characters. This book happens to have a lot of symbols such as Holden's red hunting hat which plays a major part in the story and helps define the book. In my opinion the true theme of this book is debatable and can be decided upon the individual reader's discretion. I thought an important theme is Holden's psyche and how through his trials and tribulations, he often is confused and angry but can't control everything that he wants to. That is probably what frustrates him the most and drives him to do all the things that he does throughout the whole book, good intention or no. <br /> <br />This book is without a doubt a classic piece of American literature. As classic as it may be, this book never ceases to ever lose any of its fire. Through reading The Catcher and the Rye I got a clear picture of what Holden was going through and the scenery and environment in which the setting takes place.

It well depicts the life of teenagers today, capturing and well expressing how ignorant and impulsive behavior only leads down a very narrow and steep path to the hard reality of life, felt by the main character Holden Caulfield.  <br /> <br />Holden, the novels protagonist and narrator is extremely ignorant, hard headed, unmotivated and jealous, who puts down everyone and everything around him. Holden seems to be obsessed with picking out the faults of everyone around him, calling anyone he who doesn't see things his way \\""phonies\\"". He also seems to believe that people are all liars and have alternate agendas to stab him in the back. He is so obsessed with the actions of everyone else around him; he doesn't stop to realize how immature his own actions really are. The character Holden Caulfield well relates with many teenagers growing up; confused, ignorant, and, self centered. <br /> <br />The novel also expresses Holden's constant struggle with the preservation of childhood to adult hood. He feels that growing up in today's society will corrupts the growing children of tomorrow's future even though he would never admit it. Holden very confused, is only able to relate with his younger sister named Phoebe, she is Holden's salvation and is the only person that is able to get Holden to think straight. <br /> <br />The author well captured high school ignorance in its prime, making this a book that all high school students should read. Catcher in the Rye a piece of reality mixed in with a little bit of Salinger's creativity, creating an intense, yet heart felt novel about a young boy alone in a big world with almost no one to turn to. I fell this novel would be appealing to people who enjoy watching reality television shows, and for anyone else looking for a good science fictional novel.  <br /> <br />Ultimately, this novel only covers three days of Holden's life, with no real conclusion leaving it open ended and perfect for a continued novel. I felt it as enjoyable, and a good read, excellent for anyone who feels like the weight of society is unbearable, because Holden Caulfield and the Catcher in the Rye might just be the three worst days you've ever read about.  <br /> <br />",2005-09-15

Nobody'd move...Nobody'd be different.  The only thing that would be different would be you.\\""     This quote can sum up a lot about the book.  Holden Caulfield wishes he could live a life as simple and idealistic as those of the museum's displays.  However, he realizes that even though they haven't changed, he has.  He likes the fact that he can judge one of the displays, an Eskimo, and it will never judge him back.  He only really likes the museum because it is completely opposite from what real life is like.     Holden Caulfield is a 16-year-old who has a long record of getting expelled from schools, so when he is kicked out of Pencey Prep, it comes as no surprise.  The only subject he ever did well in was English, but he always seemed to flunk out of every other class.  Even though he had a few days until he had to return home, he decided that he'd had enough of Pencey and left for Manhattan.  Instead of going home right then though, he stayed at a hotel and decided not to tell his parents that he was back.     During the three days he had until he was supposed to be home, he paraded around New York City going to the park and bars.  He was constantly trying to act older than his real age.  He used his height and the select spots of \\""gray hair\\"" that he had to pull it off.  Too many times do teenagers try to do the same thing today.  Especially when trying to act tough or that they know it all, when really, they don't anything.  They haven't lived long enough to understand that they are trying to grow up too fast.  Holden obviously tries to act much older, but most of the time, fails.  However in the some parts of the book, his youth sometimes shows.     It is said that some of the events are somewhat autobiographical.  The author, J.D. Salinger, was born in New York City and went to school in Pennsylvania, just like Holden.  When The Catcher in the Rye started gaining notoriety, Salinger retreated to Cornish, New Hampshire.  He continued writing novels there, but he did not publish them.      This book is considered a great depiction of teen angst, and with good reason.  Every teenager who reads it can relate in some way to how Holden feels about certain things.  It is simply put down into words from his thoughts in a way that almost everyone wishes they had the ability to do, minus a few cuss words, of course.  I would recommend this book to anyone being that everyone is a 16-year-old at one point in their lives.

Deemed as one of the first books written both for and about teenagers, which ultimately resulted in the \\""young adult\\"" genre, \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" was banned in most schools and still is in many cases. The protagonist is the sixteen-year-old Holden Caulfield, who narrates his own life experience of New York in the two days after he is expelled from his school. Filled with swearing, slang, teen angst and an awkward sexual encounter, the character of Holden similarly comes across as angry, embittered and frustrated, who despises \\""phonies\\"" and hypocrites, cannot help exaggerating and lying, and has very low tolerance levels toward those who annoy him - basically he hates everything. The darkly funny irony is of course the plight of all teenagers - they are constantly infuriated with other people's behaviour whilst completely oblivious to their own immature attitudes.<br /><br />Yet despite Holden's angst and frustration, he still comes across as an intelligent, introspective and ultimately understandable character. Whether or not you'd like him in real life is up for debate, but for the length of the novel he serves as an interesting narrator, a voice for the teenage state of mind and a mirror to our own selves: contradictive, confused and more than a little lost.<br /><br />So what is at the core of Holden Caulfield's confusion and anger? In a pivotal moment Holden's sister Phoebe asks him what it is that he *likes*. Though he momentarily struck dumb (teenagers like him don't like *anything*!) he eventually comes to a conclusion. He misquotes a poem by Robert Burn, \\""If a body catch a body coming through the rye\\"" and shares his fantasy of being this `catcher in the rye' (thus the book's title) - the individual responsible for catching children who stray too close to a dangerous cliff. It is this crucial passage that reveal the inner mind of Holden - as a teenager who longs to stay in childhood and furthermore to keep others there in a state of innocence.<br /><br />Such is Salinger's theory as to the nature of youth. Is this longing to stay young and resentment of the requirement to grow up the reason behind most teenagers' attitude problems? It's true that childhood is considered the \\""golden age\\"" of life - no responsibilities, no money-concerns, no career; whereas adult life is plagued with all these things and more. It seems reasonable that the adolescent years - the transformation from child to adult - are filled with uncertainty and anger.<br /><br />Of course there's more to it than this; as Holden is removed from the state of being an 'ordinary' teenager due to the death of his younger brother Allie who he reminiscences about constantly. Holden's obsession with death is also dealt with throughout the course of the novel, from his pathetic essay on Egyptian mummies to his grotesque fascination with aged people.<br /><br />Salinger constantly plays with words and meaning; which should be explored fully by the individual reader, but I can't help but share my favourite. Because Holden is preoccupied with the onset of adulthood he is likewise drawn to the ideas of sex and the inevitable passage of time that goes with it.

It is December 1949, a few weeks before Christmas, and the Pencey prep school has just expelled Holden.  He is accustomed to that; two other prep schools have thrown him out.  He's not a bad boy, though.<br /><br />Holden tells us the story of what he did during his last day at Pencey and the few days afterwards.  He gives us glimpses into his past.  He tells us a little about his oldest brother D. B., about his younger brother Allie who died when Holden was thirteen, and his kid sister Phoebe.

This is because I had heard a lot about this book, being a classic of its time and considered it as essential reading.  <br /> <br />I like reading books that are interesting and informative if not motivating and inspiring.

The book is almost akin to listening to the ramblings of an unsure teen.  Second, the relationship between Holden and his little sister Phoebe is developed in a delicate way and is at times touching. Third, Holden's occasional observations are occasionally reflective of the unadulterated insights teenagers are capable of having before formal and structured college education takes over their minds.  <br /> <br />While one can see how people may relate to the insecurities of a teenager, I for one could not and do not relate in any way and am therefore unable to recommend this.  <br />",2005-07-25

I can understand why it might have been popular when it first came out in an era where people strived for a \\""wholesome\\"" atmosphere but now this book is just 200+ pages of garbage! There are several things wrong with this book.  <br /> <br />First of all, there is the repeated swearing. I'm not usually bothered by this. Stephen King uses quite a bit of cursing, for example, but his stories are still interesting. This book, however, swears so much that the book would probably be twice as short if you took them all out. Every other word seems to be \\""g-dd--n or a variation of it.  <br /> <br />There is also the repitition of the phrases \\""____kill(s) me\\"" and \\""phony\\"". Now, this wouldn't seem so bad at first. But believe me, you have NO IDEA how incredibly annoying that gets after a while. I actually started to cringe whenever those phrases were coming up, and I'm not exaggerating. Take out those two phrases plus the swearing, and this book is reduced to about 1/4 of it's actual size - maybe less.  <br /> <br />Next there is the movement of story. The Catcher in the Rye does not go anywhere! There are a few mildly interesting, new occurences here and there but the majority of the story is about the main character,Holden, getting kicked out of his 4th school and going away to New York before having to face his parents with another rejection. During his stay in New York and once he goes home, he does basically the same, average things every day and this book - from beginning to end - is just one huge pessimistic opinion about everyday life. The story ends much the same way it began with no elevation or climactic events anywhere in between. In other words, boring. I had to force myself to finish it.  <br /> <br />Finally, there is the never-ending and annoying whines of Holden himself. Halfway through this book I was pissed off and annoyed with Holden. All he does is whine and complainabout every little thing around him. Not only is it incessive whining, it's rambling. He cannot simply state his dislike and reason for that dislike for something. He goes on and on about what he dislikes, why, the events that trigger it, what it reminds him of, and a million other things not even related to his topic. That is all this book really is - a load of complaints at absolutely everything including the harmless, meaningless things/people around him. This book does not so much give me an insight to a troubled teen's life so much as it makes me want to scream at him.  <br /> <br />There was one thing I did really like about this book. Salinger writes very well in first-person dialect. I felt as if Holden was actually talking to me in a casual conversation. It also allows the reader to figure out for themselves, why Holden acts the way he does through what he tells you and his actions. However, this conversational attitude towards it is vastly overshadowed by the swearing, lack of movement, and overall annoying-ness of Holden. Even if it is conversational, it doesn't matter much because the person having the \\""conversation\\"" with you is someone you wouldn't WANT to talk to in the first place! The purpose of this book would've been much better if it had just been a short characterization story or maybe a psychological analysis, rather than trying to pass it off as a novel that will thoroughly hold interest. The Cather in the Rye created a disillusionment of society for people in the 1950's, thus the wide-spread interest. That disillusioned fascination has died down since then, and this book should too. <br /> <br /> <br />",2005-07-22

Salinger's The Catcher In The Rye (1951) is the timeless, hugely popular blueprint for all coming - of - age novels that followed. The book's 16 - year old protagonist and antihero, Holden Caulfield, is not a rebel as many believe, but a petulant, emotionally - injured, and insecure teenager who is fluent in outrage and at odds with almost every conceivable aspect of being alive. Unlike Fitzgerald's eager, amoral, and dashing Amory Blaine (This Side of Paradise, 1920), who delights in embracing and manipulating the shiny new worlds that open upon adulthood, Holden, who is grieving the recent death of a beloved younger brother, is a prematurely gray, lanky, and disgruntled loner belatedly stuck in the awkward years of adolescence. The privileged, somewhat spoiled son of a wealthy Manhattan family, the self - loathing Holden finds himself continuously surrounded by a web of other people who are obstructing embodiments of his own worst and most reviled qualities.  <br /> <br />Informatively, the Catcher In The Rye opens and closes with hazy manifestations of homosexuality. The first goes unrealized by Holden, but the second is conspicuously realized and causes a full - blown panic attack. In the first, Holden nudgingly provokes virile prep school roommate Stradlater into a symbolical rape, a rape that leaves the ostensibly defenseless Holden bloodied but unsatisfied.  <br /> <br />The charismatic, footloose Stradlater, who is nonchalantly used to getting his way with others, is, in Holden's eyes, \\""pretty handsome\\"" and \\""very sexy,\\"" has \\""very broad shoulders,\\"" and is the type of young man Holden believes his own parents would find admirable; Holden comments repeatedly on the beauty of his roommate's golden hair. Unable to resist Stradlater's orbit, even while Stradlater is using the bathroom, Holden, a man obsessed, grabs his roommate in a headlock while he is shaving and bare - chested, and goes so far as toperform a spontaneous, effete mock tap dance for him. Crying out \\""It's the opening night of Ziegfeld Follies,\\"" Holden makes it clear that the role he is enacting in this courting ritual is one of a respectable citizen falling from grace by exhibiting his true, no - longer deniable inner nature. When the ignored Holden, who is a virgin, briefly backs away, Stradlater, \\""in just his damn shorts and all,\\"" gets \\""very damn playful\\"" in return, and the two fall into a briefly blissful wrestling match on Holden's bed. Since during this episode Holden's irrepressible behavior -- and anger -- is ostensibly the result of Stradlater's \\""giving the time\\"" to a young lady Holden covets, the narrative makes it clear that the atmosphere in their room is sexually - charged and haunted by displacement. A careful reading of this scene reveals that Holden, who reasonably lacks full self - awareness, is angry not because his roommate has had sexual intercourse with the young lady in question, but because Stradlater hasn't \\""given the time\\"" to him. Afterward, Holden describes their violent fight -- which ends with Stradlater kneeling on Holden's chest, their drooling faces inches apart -- as a \\""tiff.\\""  <br /> <br />Holden's combustible encounter with Stradlater is also partially a self - inflicted if failed initiation into manhood: \\""You never saw so much gore in your life. I had blood all over my mouth and chin and even on my pajamas and bathrobe. It partly scared me and partly fascinated me. All that blood and all sort of made me look tough.\\"" Is the bloodied Holden symbolically no longer a virgin? Does Stradlater's beating represent a provoked if less than fulfilling violation? Has Holden now become more of a man, or less of one?  <br /> <br />After the series of disastrous episodes that compose the balance of the story, some of which involve transvestites and \\""flits,\\"" as Holden calls homosexually - inclined men, the exhausted young man briefly finds false hope in the company of former teacher Mr. Antolini, one of the few adults for whom he has any respect. Comforted for the first time in the book by his teacher's wisdom and concern, Holden (\\""a very, very strange boy,\\"" Antolini calls him), \\""shaking like a madman,\\"" bolts from his mentor's apartment in well - realized homosexual panic when he awakens to find the married Mr. Antolini patting his head in the darkness. Is the wise, sympathetic Mr. Antolini molesting Holden or genuinely expressing anxious regard and tenderness?  <br /> <br />\\""I know more damn perverts, at school and all, than anybody you ever met, and they're always being perverty when I'm around,\\"" Holden now reveals. He has already conveyed that \\""Sex is something I really don't understand too hot. You never know where the hell you are. I keep making up these sex rules for myself, and then I break them right away...sex is something I just don't understand. I swear to God I don't.\\"" What rules has Holden set for himself and then broken? Holden has been told that \\""half the married guys in the world were flits and didn't even know it,\\"" and is subsequently \\""waiting to turn into a flit or something.\\"" It may be that Holden, who despises \\""phonies\\"" above all others, suffers profoundly from being an unconscious or semi - conscious phoney himself. Throughout the narrative, Holden's wishful associations with women prove to be more like sibling relationships than romantic or erotic attachments.  <br /> <br />Controversial in its day, The Catcher In The Rye shocked the American reading public with its coarse but realistic language and its sympathetic depiction of the morose, angry, often hilarious Holden, who was an explicit example of every \\""good\\"" family's worse nightmare. Today's readers will relate to Holden as all honest readers did then and have since, since Holden is only a vulnerable, frightened, perceptive everyman searching for a single validating role in life, and one who is temporarily a little more lost in the world--and within himself--thanmost find desirable.",2005-07-17

Have you ever felt sick when living in a world of formality?  Why should people always be like phonies and not express their true feelings?  J. D. Sanlinger used a boy, named Holden Caulfield, to sharply point out the sickness of the society by his keeping swearing in almost all his sentences.  Also because the protagonist is a teenager, Holden has truer mind to himself than the adults who only follows the regulations so to achieve a successful career.  Frankly speaking, he is merely a boy and he is very rebellious that his sarcastic words leave a big room for readers to ponder upon. <br /> <br /> The book is about a boy who was just kicked out of his school by flunking all the subjects except English.  Because he was so fed up with the people around him and the world, he went to New York for a three-day vacation.  In fact, he lived the craziest days of his life in those days.  While in New York, he met his old friends and his young sister.  Many of them depressed him and made him felt like to cry.  With his journey went on, he developed an idea to be the catcher in the rye, the one who leads people back to the right direction of life.  And he did.  Not in the fictional world, but in the real world to the readers. <br /> <br /> This book is a page-turner, but never a fast-read joyous book.  It tells the reality in a sad way.  Sometimes it is too sharp to make the reader making a reflection right at the moment.  Personally, I felt sick of myself when I read some particular parts of the book.  In this book, Holden keeps criticizing the fakeness and weakness of humanity such as being phony or corny, shooting craps and so on.  He feels that he is so lonely, but senses that he cannot live alone so that he keeps calling his friends even if they are the ones that he considers as phonies.  This is one of the saddest things in the world.  No one really jumps out of the world or the society and no one can really be alone.  There is an unwritten rule, the laws of nature or humanity, which human beings or other creatures must follow.  Even if many of they know something is not right or vicious, they do it anyway for the advantages of it or something else. <br /> <br /> This book is highly recommended to read.  The readers can judge the reality Holden swearing about to adjust their attitudes toward the world.  Just like Holden who did not leave for West, we stay in the world of reality by finding a decent way to live on that the catcher in the rye direct us. <br />",2005-07-02

Liked it, but didn't really get into it. Then, like any other hot-blooded, cynical, somewhat awkward and introverted youth, the onset of teenage depression and angst promptly arrived. Without really realizing it, I picked up Catcher again and re-read it. This time, something, somewhere in the brain, clicked. The feeling was analogous to suddenly being able to see three-dimension in a two-dimensional drawing, or being able to suddenly spot intricate pattern in an otherwise ordinary cloudy sky. Since then, I must have read and re-read Catcher all the way through high school and college for what seems like a thousand times. Catcher provided me an outlet, a voice, and a listener for all the raging teenage emotions. After college, the passion for Catcher has somewhat dissipated over the years. But occasionally, I flip through the book before going to bed. Gone is the intense empathy with the story and the narration. Instead, a wave of nostalgia washes over me every time I flip through the pages. It's amazing how a simple little book can capture, catalog, and evoke so much feelings and emotions that are associated with growing up. In my opinion, Catcher in the Rye is quite possibly the ne plus ultra of the genre, even Salinger himself could not outdo. Funny, melancholy, and quietly moving, if this is not great literature, I don't know what is. The only books I've read since then that call to mind Catcher and definitely worth checking out by fellow Catcher-philes are \\""Bell Jar\\"" and the graphics novel \\""Ghost World\\"".

But that's not what it is.  It is the bittersweet tale about a young man struggling survive and understand his world.  Being close to Holden Caulfield's age in the story, I liked his way of thinking, but I also related to his emotions.  He is overly sensitive, even if he doesn't realize it.  I think that's an issue with many (if not all) teens.

We can't help it.  <br /> But I don't know. I could describe my take on this book for hours and hours and it still might be all wrong.  It is, very simply put, an ode to growing up.

Salinger's 'The Catcher In The Rye' (1951) is the timeless, hugely popular blueprint for all coming-of-age novels that followed. The book's 16 year-old protagonist and antihero, Holden Caulfield, is not a rebel as many believe, but a petulant, emotionally injured, and insecure teenager who is fluent in outrage and at odds with almost every conceivable aspect of being alive.<br /><br />Unlike Fitzgerald's eager, amoral, and dashing Amory Blaine (This Side of Paradise, 1920), who delights in embracing and manipulating the shiny new worlds that open upon adulthood, Holden, who is grieving the recent death of a beloved younger brother, is a prematurely gray, lanky, and disgruntled loner belatedly stuck in the awkward years of adolescence. The privileged, somewhat spoiled son of a wealthy Manhattan family, the self-loathing Holden finds himself continuously surrounded by a web of other people who are obstructing embodiments of his own worst and most reviled qualities.<br /><br />Informatively, 'The Catcher In The Rye' opens and closes with hazy manifestations of homosexuality. The first goes unrealized by Holden, but the second is conspicuously realized and causes a full blown panic attack. In the first, Holden nudgingly provokes virile prep school roommate Stradlater into a symbolical rape, a rape that leaves the ostensibly defenseless Holden bloodied but unsatisfied.<br /><br />The charismatic, footloose Stradlater, who is nonchalantly used to getting his way with others, is, in Holden's eyes, \\""pretty handsome\\"" and \\""very sexy,\\"" has \\""very broad shoulders,\\"" and is the type of young man Holden believes his own parents would find admirable; Holden comments repeatedly on the beauty of his roommate's golden hair.<br /><br />Unable to resist Stradlater's orbit, even while Stradlater is using the bathroom, Holden, a man obsessed, grabs his roommate in a headlock while he is shaving and bare-chested, and goes so far as to perform a spontaneous, effete mock tap dance for him. Crying out \\""It's the opening night of Ziegfeld Follies,\\"" Holden makes it clear that the role he is enacting in this courting ritual is one of a respectable citizen falling from grace by exhibiting his true, no longer deniable inner nature.<br /><br />When the ignored Holden, who is a virgin, briefly backs away, Stradlater, \\""in just his damn shorts and all,\\"" gets \\""very damn playful\\"" in return, and the two fall into a briefly blissful wrestling match on Holden's bed. Since during this episode Holden's irrepressible behavior--and anger--is ostensibly the result of Stradlater's \\""giving the time\\"" to a young lady Holden covets, the narrative makes it clear that the atmosphere in their room is sexually-charged and haunted by displacement.<br /><br />A careful reading of this scene reveals that Holden, who reasonably lacks full self-awareness, is angry not because his roommate has had sexual intercourse with the young lady in question, but because Stradlater hasn't \\""given the time\\"" to him. Afterward, Holden describes their violent fight--which ends with Stradlater kneeling on Holden's chest, their drooling faces inches apart--as a \\""tiff.\\""<br /><br />Holden's combustible encounter with Stradlater is also partially a self-inflicted if failed initiation into manhood: \\""You never saw so much gore in your life.

All that blood and all sort of made me look tough.\\"" Is the bloodied Holden symbolically no longer a virgin? Does Stradlater's beating represent a provoked if less than fulfilling violation?

This is the only word that I was able to say when I started reading \\""Catcher in the Rye\\"" and when I finished reading it. I could never take my eyes from this book when I first started reading it because of the way it was written. It was so different from the novels I had read before. It was special. Unlike other stories which use big fancy sophisticated words with complicated and twisted plots this book was very casual, making it easy to understand and relate to. This novel was so interesting and humorous that I could not take my eyes away from it until I finished reading the whole thing. <br />  <br />I think I loved this book because I was able to relate and connect with the main character. The way the high school student Holden Caulfield is afraid of change and growing old reminded me of myself a lot. I too am a high school student who is afraid of growing up, graduating school and entering the harsh adult world where there is indeed hypocrisy and falsehood like Holden describes. While reading this novel and looking into the society through the young teenager's eyes, I felt like he was the extreme side of me.  <br />  <br />This book was really interesting in the way how it was so easy to read, yet containing a deep view about reality and society. The content portrays reality in a somewhat exaggerated and humorous way and it is great how most of the readers are able to relate to this story since most of the readers have experienced the age of sixteen once in their lifetime.  <br />  <br />Overall the book was amazing: In the end I really hope Caulfield resolved all his pessimism and problems toward the world and lived a better life than what he had lived before.  <br />",2005-05-17

Salinger. There were things about this book I enjoyed, but there were also things I wish I could've changed.  <br />The main character in this book is named Holden Caulfield. Holden is sixteen years old and had trouble finding his place in society throughout the entire book. This part of the book I enjoyed. There are a lot of teenagers who are still trying to find their identity and feel like they don't quite \\""fit in.\\""  <br />Another interesting part was to see how many different things happens to him in just a short span of four days. The part of the book I wasn't too fond of was the flashbacks. It seemed like a large portion of the book was narrated in the form of these flashbacks. It's hard to remember if he's talking about the past or if he's talking about the present because it switches so rapidly. The beginning of the book takes place in December before his school closes for Christmas break. He ends up getting expelled from Pencey Prep School. This happens to high school students. So this made it realistic and believable. Another part of the story I felt was a little far-fetched was when he was in New York City trying to get a prostitute to have sex with him. At age 16 looking for a prostitute seems highly unrealistic to me as a reader.  <br />Throughout this whole book he tries to fine a degree of understanding. He tries to find his place in the world. From all of his encounters from the various people he meets in the city, he along with the readers, realize that he is very different from other people. Another thing I didn't like about the book was how depressing it was. It created a very dark and gray picture in my mind. I'm not sure I'm into the whole depressed side of the story but I really enjoyed wondering what was going to happen next.  <br />I thought it was weird for his younger sister, Phoebe, to question his negativity when he finally came back home to his parent's house.

The characters are so well developed I felt as though I could picture them in real life.  J. D. Salinger did an amazing job with this book.   <br />At the beginning of the Catcher in the Rye, you are introduced to the Narrator and main character of the book.  Holden has been presented to you with no limitations on his expectations or thoughts on any specific topic or item.  He for the most part hates everything around him.  Holden often makes references to people being \\""bastards\\"" or \\""phonies,\\"" I think this shows his dislike for people around him.  I think he does not like these people because he is not very self-confidence about himself.   He has some background with different topics that have greatly influenced his life and make him the person he is.  The death of his brother, his love for his sister, the resentment he feels for his parents and a relationship he once had with a young girl all make up the personality of Holden. <br /> The story line of this book is very interesting.  Overall, the whole thing takes place in 3 days but because of the detail used in the book and all of the flashbacks it seems like it is happening over a longer period of time to me.  The setting is described in such detail that I can visualize the boarding school bathrooms and the nightclub Holden goes to very easily in my mind. <br /> I think this book is an example of excellent writing.  It is a fast read and very enjoyable, as long as you have a sense of humor and remember this is how a lot of teenagers think and feel.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is at least a freshman in high school or older.

Many might read this book and simply write off Holden as a classic sociopath, I know I did at first, but one must really evaluate what goes on with Holden's choices and rituals and continual rebellions to the endeavors and situations of a much intimidating elder world.  Catcher in the Rye relates somewhat well to a very intriguing book entitled The Perks of Being a Wallflower.  However, the main character in Perks seemed much more open to society and acted in many more positive ways.  His attitude too, preferably appeared to be significantly less depressing than Holden's attitude certainly was.  Catcher in the Rye was very well laid out, very well written, extremely easy to understand, very relative to a teenagers life, and immensely intriguing.  However, the underlying negative, depressing tone seemed somewhat agonizing after the first 150 or so pages and other books exist in the world, that deal with the same sociological topic, which are not so incredibly dismal and disheartening.

Set against the nostalgic backdrop of World War II as it was winding down, CATCHER presents a series of flash backs from the 17-year-old protagonist, who is housed in a mental facility in California.   Holden Caulfield at 16 is hardly a heroic type; rather he's a poor little rich kid who's just been expelled from his 4th boarding school.  The entire 213 pages consist of Holden's non-stop personal revelations about himself, his family and his fellow students.  Rarely requiring sleep or even sustenance, this whacked-out kid rambles during 100 pages to recount just one 24-hour period, leaving readers somewhat bewildered and breathless. <br /> <br />    For various reasons Holden decides to leave Pencey Prep several days before their official Christmas break starts-thanks to cash from a generous grandmother.  Taking a train to NY City-where he was raised-he tries to make it on his own for four days, before shamefully returning home to admit yet another academic debacle.  During this time, when he drops below the parental radar screen, he experiences a series of social and physical adventures-most of which prove unsatisfactory or unsavory.  His fertile brain spews out unceasing commentary on Life, plus those kids and adults who crossed his path; he dips ever deeper into flash backs about his previous schools.   <br /> <br />     Salinger's style of verbal gushing is easy to read-chatty and conversational, in fact--but the frantic pace can exhaust his readers.  The way Holden abuses his body results in several bouts of illness for him, but his deepest wound may prove the death of his brother during the war.  Were it not for the loyal devotion of his little sister, Phoebe, Holden might not be able to hang on his sanity as well as he almost has.  He wonders if he needs faddish Psychoanalysis.  Shrinkage is what he eventually gets, but is that the only path to the fullrecovery of his delicate psyche? <br />     <br />    In the mid 80's one Ferris Bueller took a Day Off-- perhaps inspired by Holden's mid-Forties private break with reality.  Contemporary teenagers may not sympathize with his anguished pilgrimage to escape the phonies of this world.  CATCHER proves a grim roller coaster ride through the thought processes of a disturbed youth, who makes a point of honor to be NOT HOME-alone. <br />",2005-01-25

Salinger <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Catcher in the Rye is a about a teenage boy from New York who expresses his feelings and thoughts as he struggles with problems in his life.  Holden Caulfield lives at school in a dorm but he had been in and out of four different schools.  He had a brother who died of leukemia.  He has parents and a younger sister, Phoebe.  He looked up to his brother, D.J, who was a writer. <br /> <br /> In the Book The Catcher in the Rye I could relate to some of Holden's typical days.  For example, Holden spent a lot of time in his dorm room at Pencey.  He was not into sports and liked to be alone.  When he was in his dorm an older classmate would come in, not invited, and get on his nerves by picking up his personal stuff.  Holden did not do well in school.  He did not have ambition or think about his future.  I could relate with him about this because when teachers and parents lecture me about grades and my future, it is hard to always do my best.   Sometimes my mind is thinking about other things.  Like Holden, I am not into sports, and it does not bother me to be alone.   I like to listen to music, play drums, and spend time with my girlfriend.  Holden knew girls but did not have one particular girlfriend.  It was sad to read about his trouble with girls.  <br /> <br />This book helped me realize that many teenagers go through hard times.  Holden did not like phony people.  For example, when one of Holden's headmasters met parents, he would pick and choose which ones he would talk to.  The others he would just shake their hand and give them a phoney smile.  This made me think about phony people.  For example, if one of my \\""friends\\"" greets me in a friendly manner then asks for a favor this upset me. Another example is when people say they will hang out with me and they decide not to show up.  Another reason how I relate to Holden is when he would get upset when guys would always lock their dorm doors and not let certain people in.  He thought the guys were mean but kept it to himself.   <br /> <br /> Also The Catcher in the Rye helped me realize that you can still make it through hard times because there is always someone else to talk to and that there is always someone else who has or had a harder life then you. When I read about Holden's thought about what he wanted to do with his life as a catcher in the rye.  It did not make much sense until I gave it more thought. My thought was he only wanted to have a simple job.  A job with only one responsibility where he would catch the falling children if they went over a cliff.  I think what Holden was going through as a teenager was too much for him to handle so when his sister asked him what he would like to be he choose one simple thing. <br /> <br /> <br />",2005-01-21

Holden deals with Pencey Private School, were he encounters, Stradlator, a ladies man that is totally full of himself, Ackely, a pimplefaced loser. And many other people that he would just consider phonies. The story is more tied together when dealing with title, Catcher In The Rye. The actual poem, about a child near the edge of a cliff. And later in the book, we learn that Holden believes he is a catcher in the rye, to save that child from falling from the cliff. The cliff described in the poem to Holden is the evils of society. Thats why Holden always acts cynicilly toward society. He sees nothing bad in everything, except his little sister Phoebe whom he loves all lot. She herself is a representation of the child in the poem. Holden believes his purpose in life is to a sort of savior to children from society. He wants to keep there innocence. In one sequence in the novel, he is outside Phoebe's school and he sees the phrase F*** Off! penned on the building. He tries to clean it off.

I related to his feelings and identified with so many of his comments that I was enthralled in the book for two days and did little else but read it. <br /> <br />However, I am not sure if I see what all the hype is about. I wasn't aware that feelings and comments like Holden's were all that uncommon, so why is the book so controversial?  Sure, it came out at a time where society was significantly less open about certain topics, but by now, with all the crap we allow to infiltrate the media, it should be old news that teenagers are cynical and irrational and hate everyone, even the people they love, if that makes sense. <br /> <br />Am I wrong in saying that I found absolutely nothing wrong or unusual about his thoughts or behaviors?  Thus I also did not understand why he was apparently in a mental hospital at the end of the book.  I was under the impression that it was pretty much accepted that the entire world is full of \\""phonies,\\"" and, yeah, it sucks, but you just kind of have to learn to deal with it in your own way, right?  Holden was not mentally ill. <br /> <br />I think it is interesting that Lennon's assassin was carrying a copy of the book when he shot him, so I guess he thought Lennon was a \\""phony\\"" and that was his way of dealing with it?  Also, in the movie Conspiracy Theory, Mel Gibson's character buys a copy of the book every time he sees it, but he's never read it.  The book didn't seem to be all that relevant to the movie, in my opinion, but it is another interesting incedent in which this book appeared. <br /> <br />Honestly I really liked this book because I really like Holden and related to him, but I fail to see what the big deal is.",2005-01-13

However, I didn't really find that I related to Holden all that much. I mean of course there are many similarities between him and every other reader (most people like to think they're genuine and would share Holden's particular dislike of \\""phonies\\""), but I don't agree with a common thread I've heard about the book that it's this classic for growing up and everyong should read it and will totally relate to it. In a very interesting scene in Six Degrees of Separation, the con artist analyses this book and its relation to violence. Perhaps Salinger did not want everyone to exactly relate to Holden. <br /> <br />What I found best and worst about the book was something else - it really creeped me out. It felt like a combination of the film Stand by Me with the novel A Clockwork Orange - bittersweet coming-of-age coupled with psychosis. The fact that Holden felt to me more like a 12 year old trying to act like an adult than a 16 year old, his obvious deep-seated depression and the way topics like sex were treated in many scenes (very interesting when you consider that the book was written in the 50s and looking at it from that perspective changes a lot) made it seem like a nightmare. But that's one of the best strengths of Catcher in the Rye - it will challenge you and get you out of the comfort zone. For me, it showed that societies that attempt to be wholesome often aren't, but rather contain many deep recesses of everything that is uncomfortable and harmful - and Holden found himself in one of those recesses. <br /> <br />A great work that will make you think, and a special treasure if you like debating about the meaning of books.",2005-01-08

Holden shifts from the adult reference of \\""sexual intercourse\\"" to the slang of  \\""giving it to her\\"", and Adley defend his \\""goddam religion for Christssake\\"".  Both boys employ verbal irony unintentionally showing their place between adolescence and adulthood.  Holden hears the incorrect lyrics of \\""If a body catch a body comin' through the rye\\"" instead of the correct  \\""if a body meet a body comin' through the rye\\"".  He would like to catch and genuinely help children in a field of rye as they run toward a cliff, as he has admires in the nuns he encountered.  Ironically, Phoebe, whom Holden loves and respects, presents the reality of the lryic and error in Holden's compassionate desire. She tells him it is \\""meet\\"" not \\""catch\\"" and therefore the phoniness of those who seek to be attractive and impress, the Stradlaters and Sally Hayeses, are what is real.  Holden repeatedly refers to himself as yellow, yet he has the confidence to flirt with many older women, order drinks, and insult Stradlater and Maurice, the elevator operator. Mr. Antolini's home initially is a place of refuge for Holden.  He respects Mr. Antolini and feels safe with him until Antolini makes homosexual advances and once again Holden fears his environment.  Holden wonders what the ducks at a pond in central park do in winter.  Though he cannot function in his own world he compassionately chooses to be concerned with the ducks.

D. Salinger's \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" has assured its place in the literary cannon. Dealing with issues that were too hot for the 50s --like adolescents talking so openly about sex, and drinking and smoking-- the magnificent novel faced some negative critics by that time, but after the 60s it started to be regarded as it deserves to.<br /><br />One of facts that made \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" so popular is the fact that Salinger tap into the emotions on the readers in a way it had never been done before. And in the 60s --with the counterculture --, the book was seeing as the story of an individual's alienation within a heartless world. By that time, the novel's protagonist, the unforgettable Holden Caulfield, represented young people all over the world who were dissatisfied with the political and cultural moment.<br /><br />As the plot of the novel is widely known, nowadays it is much more interesting to review and comment it rather than simply summarize. To begin with, the main character, Holden, is a person who cannot connect with other people -- that's why he is always moving from one place to another. The only supporting character who has two different moments with him in the novel is his youngest sister Phoebe -- all the others appear and disappear only once, like his schoolmates, a girlfriend and a teacher.<br /><br />This absence of connections seems to run in the Caulfield family for a little while -- since the youngest son Allie died. This death, alongside with the suicide of one of Holden's schoolmates, has an important resonance in the protagonist's life and attitude towards the world and other people. It seems that he has always been let down by others (parents, friends, siblings...) and he (un)consciously decide to stop connecting with people.<br /><br />Moreover, he is very judgmental of everything and everybody. But this peculiarity makes of Holden a very human figure. Most adolescents behave in this way. He is always criticizing and philosophizing about people who are boring, insecure or phony (like he says all the time). Probably this kind of behavior disguises his own fears and insecurities. He is hardly close to any adult. The only one who tries to establish a tie with Holden is a former teacher, Mr Antolini (who, by the way, happens to be the most human adult in the novel, but it is normal, since Holden is narrating the story). However, using a lame excuse, the boy fails to establish any emotional tie even with this man. As a matter of fact, he cannot have an emotional tie with anyone even with his little sister, who he claims to be \\""little too affectionate sometimes\\"", when she tries to embrace him.<br /><br />Therefore, Holden is the kind of person who usually victimized himself -- as he says to an old teacher, he feels on \\""the other side\\"" of life. However, the more we learn about him, the more we know that this alienation is a way of protecting himself. The connection -- or even interaction -- with other people confuse and overwhelm him, and his cynical sense of superiority serves as a type of self-protection. But this alienation turns out to be the main cause of his pains.  He needs love and contact, but he can't deal with them when he has them.<br /><br />Probably Holden's loneliness is the main motif in \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" -- that in the end is a bildungsroman, a novel that shows the growing of a young man into an adult. His lack of structure to connect to others haunts him throughout the whole narrative. This problem results in his absence of having intimate relationships and even close friends. It is so clear to most readers, but Holden himself can't see it. It feels like when we are in the center of the problem we cannot see the solution.<br /><br />Reading \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" is an unforgettable experience to any reader, be he/she and adolescent or an adult.

In his own words, \\""I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy\\"".<br /><br />The plot is quite simple, mainly what happens when a particularly sensitive teenager gets kicked out of school, and decides to travel alone a little bit instead of just telling his parents what happened. However, even if the main premise is common enough, the way it is delivered is what makes this book so special that it has become a classic. Salinger makes us get to know Holden, giving  the reader interesting insights into his musings, likes and dislikes (yeah, generally mostly dislikes).<br /><br />You want some examples?. For instance, and regarding teachers, he says that \\""You can't stop a teacher when they want to do something. They just do it\\"". Or when he starts to think about the things we say over and over again, without giving them any actual meaning: \\""I'm always saying `Glad to `ve met you` to somebody I'm not at all glad I met. If you want to stay alive, you have to say that stuff, though\\"".<br /><br />Holden's views are interesting, and different readers will interpret them in diverse ways, specially if their age isn't the same. To teenagers, Holden  reflects the highs and lows they have to deal with, and their struggle with the \\""phony world\\"" of adults that sometimes seems so weird, so wrong. To adults, Holden is a part of themselves that they somehow lost with the years, the innocence and the shock before things they have grown accustomed to with time.<br /><br />There are quite a few symbols in this book, but you will able to understand it even if you don't know a thing about symbology (or aren't interested in it). Despite that, I'd like to share with you a specially important symbol, the catcher in the rye that gives this book its title. Holden wants to be the catcher in the rye when he grows up: \\""Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around--nobody big, I mean--except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff.

He seems to have a sadness inside of him that affects the way he looks at the world, and even though he does things that should be considered bad, you end up not seeing them like that at all, because he does them almost without meaning to.  <br />I say this book is sad, meaning that in its own way the narrator transmits to you a sadness without the actual content of the book really being sad.

It got a brief mention in the introduction of \\""A Clockwork Orange\\"", when someone was comparing Alex to Holden Caulfield (the teenage protagonist of \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\""). I never had to read the book at school but I knew some who did. Apparently a lot of girls make their boyfriends read it. I also learned that it was Mark Chapman's favourite book. (Mark Chapman was the guy who killed John Lennon, in case you're wondering.) Chapman's enthusiasm for the book would more accurately be described as an obsession, as he seemed to base his life entirely around the mind set of the angry young narrator. <br /> <br />Last week I finally got round to reading \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"", which I really just bought on a whim. Personally, I quite liked the book, it made a change from the kind of literature I normally read. Although I couldn't relate to Holden Caulfield  completely, certain things did strike a chord.  <br /> <br />Like many teenagers, Holden is plagued by a crisis of identity, a sense of nihilistic self-pity, an unshakable belief that adults are all phony, everyone sells out and society is superficial.  Is this just self-indulgence? Well, yes, but that is one of the luxuries of being an adolescent: to be convinced that everyone except you is a moron. Holden even concedes that he himself may be a madman, so he's not completely pig-headed. While Holden see double standards and hypocrisy everywhere, he too admits to being a huge liar. Hypocrisy is not a uniquely adult condition, it's just as prevalent in childhood. No one can have a frame of mind completely free of contradictions and inconsistency.   <br /> <br />Set in the 1950s, the story takes place over a couple of days in New York, with Christmas approaching. Holden, who has just been kicked out of yet another school, lets us in on his cynical world view. Like the typically confused and \\""sensitive\\"" rebel, Holden seems to be disillusioned with everything, a listless soul with no real sense of direction in life. Two or three other characters try to help him but their advice goes in one ear and out the other. If there is one person Holden truly loves and admires, it is his younger sister Phoebe. She seems to be the only character in the book that hasn't let Holden down. She still has her innocence. Sadly, this can't last forever. She too will grow up, and it's just possible her outlook too will descend into cynicism.  But for now we see Phoebe as a ten year old girl with ideals. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the kind of uncertainty Holden contends with doesn't necessarily fade away with the onset of adulthood.  Since Holden was a teenager in the 1950s, it would be interesting to know what he would be like today as a middle aged man, assuming he survived the turmoil and angst of adolescence.  Would he have straightened out? From what we read in the book, one can only hope he has. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />",2004-12-19

Holden Caulfield knows the world is full of phonies, and even if he lies a little himself, that's part of life too. <br /> <br />On the surface, this is a story about nothing.

He doesn't want to tell his parents, so he gets a cheap room and spends a few days drinking, smoking, and catching up with old friends. <br /> <br />What that doesn't tell you is that Holden is on the verge of a moral and emotional collapse.

I started the book without knowing anything about it, and I was pleased to see that it wasn't the same as most of the other books I'd been required to read.  Holden, the main character and narrator, has a colorful vocabulary, and he's not above dropping a few verbal bombs.  He is also very genuine, telling things exactly as he sees them.  This results in a rough, perverse book, that turns some readers off.  However, the book needs to be this way.  Throughout the novel, Holden constantly denigrates phonies and phoniness.  If Holden told his story without his constant swearing and pessimistic attitudes, then the book itself would be phony.

Although he is very smart, Holden has a history of getting kicked out of school for not trying hard enough in his classes. The story takes place at his current school Penecey, where, once again, he's gotten kicked out. He decides he shouldn't go home right away because he doesn't want to be there when his parents receive the bad news. As Holden gives his parents a few days to get the letter and cool off, he spends his time roaming around New York, having one small misadventure after another. Throughout the story Holden goes from staying at swanky, posh, hotels, to getting robbed by a prostitute and her pimp (the bell boy). He later decides that running away is what he really wants to do. Over time, through visits with his sister and meetings with other friends and teachers, he realizes home is where the heart is and starting over is always an option. <br /> <br />Author Biography: Jerome David Salinger was born in New York in 1919.When he turned 18 Salinger spent five months in Europe in 1937. From 1937 to 1938 he studied at Ursinus College and New York University. Salinger began his writing career, writing short stories for magazines in New York. Of his early work, a story called \\""A Perfect Day For Banana Fish\\"" stood out. The Catcher in the Rye, his first novel, was published in 1951. Salinger later published Franny And Zooey (1961) and Raise High the Roof-Beam, Carpenters and Seymour -- An Introduction (1963) as well as other short stories. After the literary fame of The Catcher in the Rye, Salinger became an outsider and a loner. He moved from New York to New Hampshire where he continued to write novels but did not publish them.  <br /> <br />Evaluation: The Catcher in the Rye is about a young teenager, Holden Caulfield.  <br />Holden epitomizes the growing pains every young high school student. After he gets kicked out of school he decides not to go home rightaway and spends his time roaming around New York having little adventures. This is a story of a boys journey of figuring out himself and the world around him. <br /> I really enjoyed reading \\""Catcher in the Rye\\"". I enjoyed the main characters sarcasm and how you could relate to how he felt. The story of how Holden decides to deal with his issues is funny, witty, and poignant. Although I haven't gone through what he has, I could relate with how he felt slightly lost at times, and how he got so wrapped up in his crazy ideas. A really important part of the story, I thought, was how every time he went to do something crazy or had some wacky idea, sooner or later, there was always someone (whether is was a teacher, friend, or his sister) to snap him back into reality and make him realize that it wasn't a good idea. But I also thought it was sad that he had a support system all along but never realized it. I thought the book was extremely well written and was tremendously funny. The book reels you in with it's witty style, and gives you the wonderful feeling that everyone, at one time or another, goes through the awkwardness of being young, and the satisfaction that everything will turn out okay in the end. <br />",2004-11-05

I'm not an avid reader and if a title doesn't catch my eye, I am usually not too enthused about the book. However, I am glad that I stuck it out and read the whole novel. I think it provides a new insight to life and really makes you think about the world around you. <br />The book is a coming of age tale about a young man named Holden Caulfield. Holden is expelled from Pencey Prep School. He has struggles within himself and many minor conflicts with other characters. For the most of the book Holden is talking to himself and to the reader in his head. <br />You can tell that he is different emotionally and mentally than most people his age. He has a superior outlook on human behavior but overanalyzes many things about life. Holden goes on and on about what he would have done to a guy who stole his gloves. He lays out a scene like it actually happened, but instead of pretending to beat the guy up, Holden acts like he would in real life even though it is his daydream. After Holden argues with the guy back and fourth in his mind for a while he says, \\""It could go on like that for hours. Finally, though, I'd leave his room without even taking a sock at him.\\"" <br />J.D. Salinger has a very unique style that made me connect with Holden on a very deep level. Even though Holden is kind of a burnout I still cared about him because of the way that Salinger portrayed him and showed his emotions. In one instance where he was watching his sister play, his emotions really come out. \\""I was damn near bawling, I felt so damn happy, if you want to know the truth. I don't know why. It was just that she looked so damn nice, the way she kept going around and around, in her blue coat and all. God, I wish you could've been there.\\"" Throughout the whole book you really feel for Holden and his situation even though you might not have ever experienced anything that he goes through in the book.  <br />The storytakes place back in the early 1940's of New York. Holden jumps around from school to school because he can't stand the phoniness of the people around him. He doesn't have much respect for adults, but he really likes kids. This is apparent through the way that Holden speaks of children, and the way he is afraid to act like an adult.  <br /> I thought that the plot was slow moving, and there was not much action to the story. If you want a fast paced book that keeps you on the edge of your seat, this is not the book for you. If you want a book that can teach you a lesson about life and appeal to your emotions, then this is definitely a book that you should read. <br />",2004-11-05

This book explains his last couple of days before Christmas break.  He attended an all boys' school named Pencey Prep, which he left.  He then went into New York City for a few nights.  He tells this story as though it is a monologue.  Holden is in a mental facility as he recalls these past experiences. <br /> It all started one night with his roommate Stradlater.  Stradlater became interested in one of Holden's female friends.  Holden didn't like the idea of Stradlater and Jane Gallagher together.  He expressed his anger in the only way he knew how, fighting.  This was not a good idea, because Stradlater ended up getting the best of Holden.  This whole incident makes Holden decide he is going to leave his school, and he leaves in the middle of that night.  <br /> Holden then travels to New York on train.  His family has lived there his whole life.  He checks into a hotel, and has many interesting things happen to him.  He gets involved in unimaginable predicaments.  After two days, he decides to go sneak and see his sister Phoebe, and after all of the bad things that have happened to him this makes him feel better because he has always been able to communicate with her.  He told her he is going to move out west, but this never happens. <br />Holden never really talks about his condition, or why he was hospitalized.  That is left up to the reader; I personally think it is because he had a severe case of depression.  He was always a very lonely person, with no real ambition or drive in his life.  He is sort of a lost soul.  It seems as though he matured, and began to see the world with a wider perspective, and became more understanding towards the end of the book. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this book for a couple reasons.  I think that the book focused too much on one single character, I would have liked it to expand more on other things.  The book is not all bad though.  Phonies, lies, imagination, and innocence are portrayed quite well in this book.  Holden focuses a lot on people being phony, and all the phony things in the world.  However, I really enjoyed how this book makes one think.  Holden brings up many interesting points about life, and if you look behind the words, it will make you think also.  Although this book did have some good points to it, I would not recommend this book, I think that it can become redundant and at some points boring.   <br />",2004-10-27

Salinger was the first book in my life that i have actually enjoyed reading the entire way through. Usually kids find books relatively boring, but the way Salinger's imagination takes off in this book is just astounding! <br />I found the main character, Holden very similar to myself. There for could probably relate to many kids who read this novel. <br /> I have never read a book where you have to think so deeply about life. The odd thing was i understood everything that Salinger was talking about. The symbolism is all through the book. Trying to link things together to better understand them was such a fun aspect of reading it. For example his obsession with the ducks in the central park pond symbolizes Holdens' purpose in life and where he's going with his life. The whole book is like this, symbolic meanings are everywhere. The title of the book is the largest symbolic meaning, and also the most important symbolic meaning; but you'll have to read it to find out. <br /> Holden is a seventeen year old boy who is very confused about life. His rebellious attitude toward everything is quite funny actually. I enjoyed how he called everyone a phony except for his own family and one girl who he liked. He thought if someone was very talented at something they were phony because they were \\""too good\\"" at it. I couldn't help but laugh at that. <br /> Although I laughed at Holden's rebelliousness, there were times where I felt where he was coming from. The \\""dont care about anything\\"" attitude I could really relate to. Holden doesn't care about anything but his family in this book. He's getting kicked out of Prep school in New York City, because he failed 4 out of 5 classes. It's not even that he doesn't care about his education rather than he's so opinionated that he thinks school is a waste, because its preparing you for a phony life. <br /> Holden is the most opinionated and spontaneous character i have ever imagined.

These pages cover the exploits of one Holden Caulfield, a cynical teenager in 1950s America. If I had to describe the book, I'd say it is one prolonged moment covering ~200 pages. The style is reminescent of Jack Kerouac's On the Road, but I feel Catcher in the Rye is a far superior book.     I guess the common chord this book strikes with everyone is that fragile innocence of childhood. The world started out kind and simple for everyone under their parents' wing, but somewhere along the way - 'Bam!' - we're protesting the government, fighting wars and cursing out bosses under our breath. The journey between those two points is often bewildering and confusing, with qualities lost and gained in the transformation. What makes Holden particularly tragic is that he sees this loss of purity coming. In the end Holden shares the same longing of innocence heralded by William Blake and embodied by Peter Pan. Never grow up. Protect your purity. Don't sell out.    Unfortunately, it's a doomed endeavor. We all get older and more cynical as youth crumbles to adulthood. But Holden holds on, and I guess what happens to him in the end is only a natural result of his efforts. Life can be very unkind if you don't play along. Some books teach, while others forecast.

I first read the novel in High School like many, I'm sure.  The book covers the story of the young and innocent Holden Caulfield in his search for something genuine.  The novel discuses the life of the typical teenager, but with more truth than others are willing to admit.  The author does this by letting the reader in on Holden's personal thoughts, thoughts that in reality most people come to know.<br /><br />  Holden comes from a well of family, which does not in return make his life easier.  His family seems to ignore the heartbreaking event of the death of Holden's older brother, which Holden is then left to deal with completely on his own.  He comes off as a rebel by not doing much in school and not seeming to care much for others, but he is revealed to be quite intelligent and friendly in his own way.  Throughout his family and friend relationships Holden begins to find positive characteristics in which society contains.  Holden struggles to look beyond the phoniness of his society in trying to simply find something genuine.  The author J.D. Salinger contradicts some of Holden's actions, which may seem like an accident, but it was an intentional accident.  Salinger does this to aide in revealing life lessons taken in by Holden and the reader. Throughout reading Holden's thoughts, you come to pity him and even empathize what he's going through.  In the end the reader learns that Holden does truly have good intentions, which is revealed in his admiration and caring for his younger sister, Pheobe.<br /><br /> One negative side could be that the novel seems a little wordy at points, but this factor is instantly over ruled once Salinger concludes the point he was trying to illustrate.<br /><br /> This is one novel that will ever grow old.  The author, J.D. Salinger brings up issues dealt with by Holden that can simply not be ignored by not only teenagers, but the by the rest of society too. Every one should read this book.

The main character Holden tells his story of growing up in the world at the young age of sixteen.  Holden is immersed in the pains of growing up, and fed up with all the \\""phonies\\"" of the world.  When kicked out of Pency Prep School, Holden spends a couple nights in New York.  There he is surrounded by the pointless ideas of society, which everyone seems to believe and go right along with.  Holden does not hold his feelings about this \\""phoniness\\"" back at all.

I've been especially reading those who disliked the book.  Most comments are that Holden is a complainer, or that there is no plot.  And the only thing I can say is that those people need to look deeper into the text.  Trust Salinger.  Everything in that book happens for a reason.  This book isn't about some angry teenager who hates everyone, it's Salinger showing us the loss of innocence in the world.  Throughout the book Holden  shows a extreme hate for \\""phonies\\"".  Adults who live to make money.  The headmaster of his school(s), people who produce movies. etc.  And yes, Salinger shows us how Holden is phony too at some times.  Basically, Holden dislikes most adults, because let's face it, for most adults these days making money has become a large chunk of the day.  Too large, according to Salinger.  This is why, I think Salinger retired from public life, and why he is now writing stories no one else can read.  But back to the book.  Holden shows frustration for most adults who have been corrupted by their surrounded materialistic world.  And then there are the children, particularly Allie and Phoebe, the two people in the book Holden shows a strong liking for.  They are also the only children Holden knows closely.  Unlike the \\""phony\\"" adults, Allie and Phoebe were still innocent, and pure.  They were protected from the world out there that's about making money, and \\""getting the most miles per gallon\\""  etc.  This brings us to teh title of the book.  \\""The Catcher in the Rye.\\""  the guy who catches children who fall off \\""some crazy cliff.\\""  That's what Holden wants to be.

There are a lot of great \\""modern classics\\"" that I somehow missed out on in school - for whatever reason I was never required to read them - so now that I'm in college I've been trying to catch up on my own. \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" is the latest of these that I've completed, and while it didn't stop me in my tracks, it was certainly worth the time spent. The story follows one weekend in the life of sixteen-year-old Holden Caulfield, who is disillusioned and depressed by the \\""phoniness\\"" of the world, but is at the same time unable to escape and finds himself playing the same social mind games he is so disgusted by. Every time he tries to \\""break out of the mold,\\"" so to speak, something else goes wrong in his life.<br /><br />Holden's descent into what can be seen as either madness or simply severe manic depression (the latter seems more likely) begins when he is kicked out of Pencey Prep, yet another school in a long line of high-class institutions where his family has placed him. Not wanting to go home early and inform his parents that he has once again been booted out, he decides to find a hotel in New York City and wait out the last few days of the term. Left alone with far too much time to kill, Holden's mind focuses more and more on the seemingly pointless societal affectations performed by everyone he meets, and which he must play along with himself.<br /><br />Though the story takes place in the 1940s, Holden's disillusionment is very similar to what many teens of today go through at some point or another while growing up. If Holden were a teenager of today, a doctor would probably put him on antidepressants post-haste. He's not the kind of person one would probably like if one were to meet him in person. But by reading Holden's inner thoughts, the reader comes to pity and, perhaps, empathize with him. Even though he despises so much of the world, Holden has good intentions throughout the book. He keeps track of the things that really matter most: he defends a former girlfriend from his predatory roommate, even though all it earns him is a bloodied face; he maintains a fond remembrance of his dead brother Allie, and keeps Allie's old baseball glove close at hand; he makes a donation to a pair of nuns he meets in a cafe; he sneaks home to visit with his kid sister, Phoebe, and is filled with real joy just by doing things to make her happy; and when he sees lewd graffiti on the walls of Phoebe's school, he does his best to rub it out, for fear that one of the children might see it and be introduced too soon to the world he himself is struggling with.<br /><br />Perhaps most heartbreaking of all is Holden's answer to Phoebe's question, \\""Name something you want to be. Like a scientist. Or a lawyer or something\\"" (pg. 172). All Holden can think of in the way of a reply is that he'd like to spend his time watching children playing in a field, and be there to catch them if any of them should fall. He doesn't want to grow up and get a real job, and take on the responsibility of adult life - he just wants to be \\""the catcher in the rye.\\"" This is perhaps where the greatest number of people will identify with Holden. The fear of growing up and facing real responsibility is something that nags at the corners of nearly every young mind.<br /><br />The book's first-person narration reads just like something a sixteen-year-old would actually write. The slang is, of course, a bit dated, but Salinger has achieved a style that rings strikingly true even today when compared to the workings of a teenage mind. And yet it is still easy to follow. It is ironic that the only subject Holden was not failing at Pencey was English, and perhaps Salinger deliberately crafted his character this way in order to ensure that something written by Holden would be coherent to his readership. The writing is simple, and conveys the not-yet-polished style of a teenager, butat the same time makes for very easy reading.<br /><br />Though I did not read \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" in high school, now that I've finished it I honestly wish I had. It is a work that certainly should be read and contemplated by all teens and young adults. Holden's story can be seen as many different things - social criticism, a satire on teenage life, a cautionary tale - and it is probably a bit of each all rolled into one. Every reader will likely take something slightly different from it. Some readers will identify with Holden, some will pity him, some will feel threatened by or disgusted with him. Some will feel a little bit of everything about him. And the end of the story is somewhat ambiguous. There are hints of what happens to Holden, but we are not told outright, and so it is left up to the reader to reach a conclusion.

I have read great books that I've enjoyed that were written better and plotted better, but don't touch me quite the same way because I didn't connect with the characters. <br /> <br />The book has a strong stream of consiousness feel.

The first face is the most typical teen type. A general, unrational, and frivilous hate directed at anything and everybody that irks him. The second kind is the educated kind. He can put into rational words why he is angry at something. <br /> <br />The example that comes to my mind first is his distaste of the oral presentation class. Holden verbalized how he got constantly frustrated when speakers who went with their passion and strayed from the topic, but gave great heartfelt speaches, got low grades.  <br /> <br />In a way, this book is like a photograph. It's a snapshot of a certain period of time in a person's life. Not everything feels resolved, but it's like a picture of a pitcher throwing a baseball. You see the pitcher's throw, but you don't see the result. Was it a strike out? Did the batter hit a home run? All we know is that a pitch was thrown.

I am, of course, loathe to criticize a classic, but frankly I don't see what all the fuss about, for a number of reasons.  <br /> <br />Holden Caufield is an immature teenager who runs away from school and curses. A lot. The Catcher in the Rye follows Holden's journey around New York after he spontaneously decided to leave his prep school early after being kicked out for bad grades. Holden spends his time wasting his money and having run-ins at several seedy establishments. The book isn't, however, so much about things happening as what Holden thinks of them. Holden constantly bemoans the phoniness of almost eveything and everyone. He seems to dislike everyone except his younger sister, Phoebe, and he sings the praises of his dead younger brother, Allie. <br /> <br />The Catcher in the Rye is a coming of age novel. By the end of the novel, Holden begins to show some semblance of maturity, and talks about going back to school rather than running away as he had intended. Throughout the novel, Holden's complaints about 'phoniness' of almost everything are key to understanding the themes of the novel, as is his conversation with Phoebe about being 'the catcher in the rye'. Holden mistrusts the adult world, and though he doesn't ever admit it, we can deduce that he wishes to stay in the carefree world of the young where nothing ever changes. <br /> <br />Whether a person enjoys The Catcher in the Rye depends largely on whether they appreciate the character of Holden Caufield, as he is the narrator. Holden drove me nuts. Halfway through the book I wanted to strangle the kid for being so irresponsible. I found Holden hard to believe. In my personal experience, I have never met someone, even at Holden's age, who displayed the utter lack of common sense that Holden does.  <br />Read The Catcher in the Rye for an interesting perspective.

Wry, cynical and strangely touching at times, this book is a look into the confusion and turmoil of a young mind.<br /><br /> Holden Caulfield has just been expelled from a prep school for failing almost every subject he was studying. And he couldn't care less -- after all, it's full of phonies. Over the weekend, Holden wanders the streets of New York, thinking about the school, the teachers, the phonies, and his nebulous family -- especially his brother Allie, who committed suicide.<br /><br /> Fearing the repercussions of going home and telling his parents what has happened, Holden just keeps touring New York in his peculiar cap. He meets a girl he once liked, a teacher who is sympathetic to his plight, but Holden always ends up pushing others away. And when he does go home, his temptation to run away is changed irrevocably.<br /><br /> Remember the disaffected anti-hero of &quot;Igby Goes Down,&quot; who flunks school over and over, and runs away to hang out in New York? Igby has Holden to thank for his existance. &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; catches teen dissatisfaction and dreams of freedom, making it seem almost painfully realistic.<br /><br /> Most classics don't include the anti-hero sputtering four-letter words on the first page. But Salinger's style for &quot;Catcher&quot; is an unusual one. Through Holden's eyes, it's a bitter and very straightforward style, peppered with wry observations. The biggest flaw would be the handling of Holden's own &quot;phoniness,&quot; since it's obvious he can be as phony as the people around him. It's subtle, but too subtle -- to less discerning readers, it seems like Holden is just a bitter hypocrite.<br /><br /> Holden Caulfield is a surprisingly nuanced character -- at first glance he just seems like an unusually obnoxious young boy who hates everything. But as the book unfolds, we see that he cares for genuine things, especially the innocence he no longer has. And he lacks the ability to connect with other people. None of the other characters really come to life... but they don't really need to. This is Holden's story.<br /><br /> &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is a bitter pill to swallow, but it's definitely worth it.

(...the time that is, not the money)","I don't understand how anyone can list this book part of their favorite books. The books is boring--and I don't find that many books boring; in fact, just this one. The language of the book is boring, simple, and highly informal. The plot is simple, linear, and boring. The protagonist is a boring college drop-out who hates the whole world but is too afraid to do anything about it. So nothing really develops from the beginning to the end; just some guy ranting and then getting over it! And the story...THERE IS NO STORY! I can almost see J.D. Salinger with a huge smirk on his face as he's writing the last page. It's just a phony book.      I don't know. I'm just comparing this with some other novels I've read.     Take Albert Camus's The Stranger for example. The story is somewhat similar to this one--some depressed guy's typical day in Algers.... But Camus makes it interesting--and I don't mean interesting as in humorous or erotic; rather, Camus brings out the human experience, the emotions and feeling. These are all lacking in this book.    And, of course, my favorite up 'til now: To Kill A Mockingbird. That...I just couldn't put down. This one is like asking your friend how his day has been and having him tell you how boring his day has been: how he's gone to the town; watched a movie he didn't really wanted to see, and how much it sucked; called up all his friend but none of them were home; watched another movie just to kill time; called all his friends again (with the same exact details as the last time he called them); finally got a date with some girl he barely remembers; tried to hit on the girl but she freaked out; how he felt depressed; and how he finally got over it--and of course having someone write everything he says down (exactly as he says them) and publish them in a book.

Any book/story/movie that deals with teenagers' coming-of-age angst has undoubtedly been influenced by Salinger's dual portrayl of the troubled Holden, at once insanely immature; at the other, wise beyond his years.<br />&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; gives us a weekend in the life of its main character, a troubled sixteen-year-old who has just been thrown out of another school for failing all subjects, except English because he is a master at writing compositions.  He also credits himself to be a master at lying and always finds himself spinning wonderfully impossible yarns to strangers.  Holden is disaffected and somewhat emotionally withdrawn.  Through his flashbacks to the past, we learn about the death of his brother Allie and his experiences at other schools.  Allie's death has affected him more than even Holden realizes and he finds himself unable to connect to anything or anyone permanently.  And when he finds himself kicked out of school again, he fears having to confront his parents at home so he goes on a whirlwind trip to New York City, which only enhances his feelings of loneliness and isolation.<br />Salinger has created a prototype character with Holden Caulfield.  He is witty and wise, but at the same time foolishly naive and over-sensitive.  Yet his insights into the adult world and the phonie ways that people behave are bitterly correct.  Holden knows at once what he doesn't want to do or be, but couldn't tell you what he wants to do.  And when he realizes what that is, it truly is one of the most eloquently written pieces of dialogue in American literature.",2004-07-10

The novel begins with Holden, a boy in his late teens who has experienced a life with many mishaps and unjust occurrences. Pencey was the school he attended most recently, being one of many schools he had dropped out of during the past few years. He left school, ventured out on his own in the busy, chaotic city of New York. There, he met up with many acquaintances, experienced the truth in his life, and learned lessons to help improve his future. He faces the decision of what he is to do with his life, and ends up making a predictable pick. The main difference bettween either HUCK FINN or MOCKINGBIRD is that while those novels were rural, CATCHER IN THE RYE is set in New York.  Still, it's amazing to see the smilarities in the two; the way all adolescents have to make decisions. There were many educational, enjoyable scenes in CATCHER IN THE RYE. One that kept me on my toes was when Holden was first beat up by his dorm mate, Stradlater. It was suspenseful, and the way he handled the situation helped reveal his personality. Another exciting part was when Holden met up with a fellow student's mother on a trolley. He told many lies to her, and ended up regretting it after he found out she was a genuine, generous woman, much unlike her own son. When the prostitute arrived at Holden's hotel room, something rotten was bound to happen. The description of this chapter kept me reading. I enjoyed reading about the way Holden described his everyday surroundings, and what he liked, disliked, which was obvious, because he was such an open character. There were many aspects that vexed me, because he was repetitive with his attitude. He seemed to despise nearly everything, all of the time. Even cheap luggage would make an impact on his judgment of a person, and he had many other prejudices along with that. At times, the writing style seemed dull and boring because he irritated the reader with meaningless remarks. Many topics that were discussed seemed quite pointless, and Holden lacked alot of common sense as a character. I would recommend this novel to readers 14 years and older. Some material is inappropriate for younger people. The book is easy to get into, and mostly keeps you interested. The main characters are complicated and easy to both adore and abhor. The book taught me a lot about life alone through the eyes of a teenager. Because of his peer pressure, he had to make many decisions that hurt him and hurt people he loved. The novel expressed bravery and a boy able to forgo his past and attempt to start a new life. <br />Also recommended:  HUCK FINN by Twain, THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE by Crane, and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD",2004-07-04

Salinger's, The Catcher in the Rye, is an exceptional portrayal of the problems and situations that teenagers experience in their lifetime. Holden Caulfield, a seventeen-year-old boy, writes about his previous expulsion from Pencey Prep. He tries to cope with the death of his younger brother, his obsession for lying, and the problem relationships with his peers and teachers. Before Holden came to Pencey Prep, he lived a hard life. His father is an obsessive businessman, and his mother has yet to recover from the death of his younger brother, Allie. Holden fails in school, tends to get drunk and uses vulgar language. Throughout the rest of the novel, Holden encounters other students and teachers that just don't understand him and give him a hard time. Mr. Spenser, his history teacher tries to be sympathetic to Holden's problems, however he fails after a while because it is sometimes frustrating communicating with Holden. The headmaster asks Holden to leave the prep school as he is failing four of five classes and not applying himself. Holden returns home, borrows money from his ten-year-old sister, Phoebe, and leaves for the night. After that night, Holden decides to leave home, for good, and head west. Phoebe begs to leave with him, but Holden refuses. He remains confused about returning to school. The novel ends with Holden in a mental institution. <br />I thoroughly enjoyed The Catcher in the Rye because of the complex problems that Holden faces throughout the novel. Not all plotlines have to portray perfect lives of people. It is nice to have a different and unique plotline for once. It relays real-life experiences that teenagers still face today. Although this book was written 50 years ago, it remains a good lesson for children and young adults to learn today. This book kept me on the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen next. I read it all in about 3 hours, and I usually don't like to read books, however this book was different; I never wanted to put it down. Just remember, like Holden, be true to yourself, but don't overdo it and waste your life failing out of classes and getting drunk. The first step to success is succeeding in yourself and knowing who you are and what you have to do to succeed.",2004-07-04

But this is what disturbs me: there are sublte things throughout the narrative that are disturbing. Holden is always depresed and angry, cowardly and actually, impotent. He has a problem,. And no one ever points this out. Afterall, we learn that our Holden is telling his story from the lawn of a mental instutution and ends his story there. Still, no one ever comments about this.Cute as he is, the kid is really not well. He seems heterosexual, alright, but when a prostitute offers her services to a hormone-drenched teenager like Holden, how does he react? Depressed and he ends up thinking of Pheobe--his little sister. A few years ago, the author, Joyce Maynard came out with a stunning work called: 'At Home in the World'. I wish more adult fans of Salinger would take the time to read this important work to find out about the disturbed, pedophilic author, J.D.Salinger.

The way in which Salinger shows Holden Caulfield going through depression is phenomonal. The things I truly liked about the book was the accuracy of teenage bitterness toward the world. This bitterness is shown by Caulfield's sarcastic views on his school and his surroundings. The phoniness in Caulfield's life and his hypocritical outbursts of phoniness in an effort to be happy as his peers are truly makes a connection to teens everywhere. The way which Caulfield views things that are happening in his life really makes you feel for Caulfield while also almost coming to hate him. Caulfield's character deals with a self caused anger at the world and needs to somehow get over it. He seems to point out everything that is wrong with the world and nothing that is right. Caulfield goes through a list of girlfriends who almost none he truly seems to like. He also seemingly has no friends with the exception of a younger sister who seems to connect to him while also noticing that his depression is caused within himself. Caulfield seems to know this throughout the novel and his actions speak loudly about the way he feels. THE CATCHER IN THE RYE is an absolute must read for teens everywhere.

In his derisive, frustrated, bored slang, Holden Caulfield complains about anything and everything in the space of a few hundred pages. This novel has been praised as original and capturing what it is to be a teenager. It was maybe original in its time, but this is not a realistic portrait of adolescence. Most teenagers are not bored whining rich kids who hate everybody. <br />The book mostly fails because the main character is not likeable. the book could just as easily be titled &quot;Holden Caulfield's gripes and complaints against the world&quot;.

This is a wonderful read that speaks as clearly now of the experience of youth as it did when it was written 50+ years ago.<br />This book was J. D. Salinger's only novel; his other &quot;books&quot; are actually collections of short stories.  Yet, The Catcher in the Rye, by its very brilliance, has put Salinger on the list of great (even if eccentric - he went into seclusion) authors of the 20th century.<br />In short, Caulfield is what one would now call a &quot;troubled teen&quot;.  He refuses to focus on his schoolwork, is constantly in trouble for acting out, has the mouth of a sailor (on a bad day, for that matter) and, at the start of the story, decides that he is going to simply quit going to school and take an early - and extended - winter vacation.  Here the book begins.<br />The importance of the story, however, is not the actual development of the plot - his failed attempt with a prostitute, his looking up an old girl friend, his visiting his sister - but is, instead, the thought life of Holden; Salinger portrays him sympathetically.  Amidst all his cynicism, Holden shows himself to be a naive optimist, and the holding of these two things in tension is what gives Holden his dynamic.  &quot;If a body catch a body, comin' through the rye&quot;, he sings to himself: he wants to save the world.<br />The question by the end of the book, however, is whether or not Holden can do so or if, instead, he will &quot;die nobly for some highly unworthy cause.&quot;  One of Holden's old teachers, in a scene with a strange bit of homoeroticism, tells Holden that he fears he will end up as a quasi-martyr; Holden himself, in his very desire to save the young from the cliff that he himself stands so close to, confirms this fear as being a realistic one.<br />Yet, by the end of the book, Holden is almost &quot;saved&quot; by the simple love of his sister who worries about him and wants to help him out but at the same time cannot grasp the complexity of his situation.  The real gift she gives Holden is her own simple and loving trust.<br />We learn by the end of the book that Holden is going back to school with what seems to be a clearer sense of direction than he had previously.  For me, it's a fairly unfulfilling conclusion, but it serves its purpose in that it diverts attention away from what *might* be Holden's future and returns it to the focus of the book: Holden's time playing hooky, running from his problems, not finding himself so much as being found in being touched by the love of his sister.<br />It's a beautiful work that I highly, highly recommend.",2004-06-12

In New York, Holden runs into the 1950s jazz scene, prostitutes, homosexuals, and ample opportunities to drink himself to oblivion. Told from a first person viewpoint, THE CATCHER IN THE RYE depicts a young man's painful journey toward a coming of age. <br />I won't try to deconstruct the symbolism in this novel. Perhaps Holden's red hat refers to his attempts to lose his virginity and his expensive lugage is a Freudian symbol for the female. Perhaps his name indicates the need to hold onto something (certainly his dream of becoming the 'Catcher' does. Certainly sex and death underlay the entire novel. Holden attempts to confront his sexuality by picking up older women, flirting with nuns, dating a school-girl contemporary, and watching his young sister sleep. At the same time, he seems fascinated by homosexuality and fights off a homosexual encounter with an older man. <br />Anyone who has survived the teen years will identify with Holden's concern that he be cool even if it means not being able to enjoy music, the movies, or the company of the women he spends time with. His introspections on his brother's death are moving and further justify Holden's alienation from society. <br />CATCHER IN THE RYE is a modern literary classic.

The phoniness in Caulfield's life and his hypocritical outbursts of phoniness in an effort to be happy as his peers are truly makes a connection to teens everywhere.  The way which Caulfield views things that are happening in his life really makes you feel for Caulfield while also almost coming to hate him.

Caulfield goes through a list of girlfriends who almost none he truly seems to like.

Salinger's, The Catcher in the Rye, is an exceptional portrayal of the problems and situations that teenagers experience in their lifetime.  Holden Caulfield, a seventeen-year-old boy, writes about his previous expulsion from Pencey Prep.  He tries to cope with the death of his younger brother, his obsession for lying, and the problem relationships with his peers and teachers.  <br />Before Holden came to Pencey Prep, he lived a hard life.  His father is an obsessive businessman, and his mother has yet to recover from the death of his younger brother, Allie.  Holden fails in school, tends to get drunk and uses vulgar language.  <br />Throughout the rest of the novel, Holden encounters other students and teachers that just don't understand him and give him a hard time.  Mr. Spenser, his history teacher tries to be sympathetic to Holden's problems, however he fails after a while because it is sometimes frustrating communicating with Holden.  The headmaster asks Holden to leave the prep school as he is failing four of five classes and not applying himself.  Holden returns home, borrows money from his ten-year-old sister, Phoebe, and leaves for the night.  After that night, Holden decides to leave home, for good, and head west.  Phoebe begs to leave with him, but Holden refuses.  He remains confused about returning to school.  The novel ends with Holden in a mental institution.   <br />I thoroughly enjoyed The Catcher in the Rye because of the complex problems that Holden faces throughout the novel.  Not all plotlines have to portray perfect lives of people.  It is nice to have a different and unique plotline for once.  It relays real-life experiences that teenagers still face today.  Although this book was written 50 years ago, it remains a good lesson for children and young adults to learn today.  This book kept me on the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen next.  I read it all in about 3 hours, and I usually don't like to read books, however thisbook was different; I never wanted to put it down.

He is a moderately intelligent boy who doesn't apply himself at school, so he keeps flunking out.<br />At his most recent school, Pencey Prep, Holden was surrounded by kids that he didn't like.  For example, Holden's roommate, Ward Stradlater.  Stradlater is a stuck-up, handsome kid.  He thinks he can get any girl he wants, and he's probably right.  But he thinks he can walk all over everyone.  A boy in the next room over, Robert Ackley has many flaws.  First of all, he's completely unsanitary.  He never brushes his teeth, and he's always popping his zits in public.  Secondly, he is completely obnoxious and can't take a hint when people want him to leave.  Finally, he is always lying about having had sexual intercourse.<br />So because he's tired of being surrounded by morons and phonies (and because he's flunked out) Holden runs away from Pencey.  He is loaded with cash, so he decides to take a train into New York City and stay there until he's ready to go home.  The rest of the story recounts his adventures in the City.<br />For example, on the train to NYC, Holden runs into the mother of the biggest jerk at his school.  She is a nice, pretty woman.  Holden gives her a fake name and lies through his teeth about the boy.  He tells her that her son is the most popular kid in the school, and that the rest of the student body at Pencey wanted to nominate him for president, but he was too modest.<br />After having a few more adventures of the like, Holden decides to visit his nine-year-oldsister Phoebe.  His family doesn't know that he got chucked out of Pencey yet, so he has to hide from them.  Phoebe is quite a talker.  From the moment Holden gets there, she doesn't stop talking.  And she's so smart.  She realizes all of a sudden that Holden got thrown out, and she is angry with him for the rest of the night.  This is the climax of the book, because this is the first time you see the sensitive side of Holden, and because his relationship with Phoebe is very important to him.<br />If you want to read a book with interesting characters, sophisticated writing, and exciting plot, then The Catcher in the Rye is the book for you.  Holden, Phoebe, Ackley, and Stradlater are all colorfully depicted in this eloquently written novel.  J. D. Salinger's  writing matches the speech of a teenager in the fifties perfectly.  Holden's adventures in the Big Apple will keep your eyes glued to the page.",2004-05-08

I can't imagine another book nearly as real, original, or subtly humorous as Catcher in the Rye.

The funny thing is that Holden suffers from chronic lying and a personality only his sister Phoebe and a few teachers can stand.  He fits the stereotypical teenage loner type with his hatred of Pency teachers and jocks, an apathy towards schoolwork, and his need to get alchohol.  This characterization is balanced by Holden's ideals, his inability to grasp the concept of change, and his sincere love of his siblings(sister Phoebe, late brother Allie, and brother D.B.).

There are few characters that can claim to be as memorable, as iconic, as Holden, let alone be the kind of partner in pain to all of us that Holden has become. The only two people that could possibly be equal to what Holden has become are James Dean and Kurt Cobain, and those two aren't even involved with the world of literature. Holden Caulfield is indeed mroe than just a great character; he has become the voice of pain to all of those people are depressed for no reason, the disgruntled teenagers going through their troubled phases, the people who think that the world is full of phonies, the people who just can't fit in or become a part of society. Holden Caulfield is a symbol.<br />We all know the plot; nothing. And this is one of the things that I have noticed that people dislike about the book, the fact the book is virtually plotless. And I have to say, I laugh at those who are so narrow minded that they can't even accept such a &quot;drastic&quot; branch off from normality as a book that is more like a series of connected events rather than a plot. I can't wait till you get to read Finnegans Wake.<br />But, as I've already stated, the book is &quot;plotless,&quot; more like a series of events then a story, and that just contributes all the more to what the book is. The book is just a window into a mind that has come to symbolize the eternally unhappy. And what an eternally unhappy mind it is; everywhere he goes Holden calls people &quot;phonies,&quot; talks about the things that bother him, the things that sadden him, attacks the word &quot;marvelous&quot;-just pretty much Holden's stream of conscience. And as the novel goes on we follow him wherever he goes, from his professor's home (can't remember his name, or even if he was his professor) before he leaves him boarding school (can't remember that either,) to his room where he meets his roommate that he just hates, to a New York hotel, to a club, to a rendevous with a prostitute, to just about everywhere else. And through the novel we peer into his eternally unhappy mind, watch him make all sorts of observations about what's going on around him as well as life, just watching him live and exist.<br />Hopefully, you'd think that this novel'd be for everyone. I really do doubt that there are many of us here who feel exactly the same way about exactly the same things as Holden. But there are however, many of us, millions of us, the majority of us even, who do feel for Holden. There are countless observations of his and feeling sthat went through I personally couldn't help but know, one example being the lonely depressed walk that eh takes through a New York park. And there also many among us who do feel there are at least a few &quot;phonies&quot; in the world, Holden's trademark. And if you don't feel any way in relation to Holden, not even to a minal degree, then chances are that you are one of those people that Holden attacked.",2004-04-24

I had moderate optomism about the book. The Catcher in the Rye is about the misadventures of a young teen named Holden, who just go kicked out of his forth private school. I automatically thought about a rebelellious teenager whih grabbed my attention. He goes from one location to another, from school to NYC, to a mental hospital where he tells this story. Many people respect and appreciate this book and the work of the skilled author, J.D. Salinger, but they also say that you either love the book or hate the book. As much as I can respect this book, I have to say I can't stand the story.<br />Salinger does write the book in a style that I like. The scenes and descriptions described in the book are so vivid and realistic that I can easily picture everything in my head, detail to detail. The characters that Holden encounters have the same detail put into them as the settings and situations, from their looks, to attitude and demeanor, to even their bad habits.<br />However, as good as the detail is in the books, the story itself is the root of any good novel. This is where this book's quality plummets badly and my optimistic attitude therefore plummited dramitcally. First off, this novel is lacking a large element that puts a good book together: plot. I read the book, beginning to end, and there is none. There is not a single thing that would show that the story has a plot or a task at hand. Most would say that the task for Holden is to get home after being kicked out of school, but a large chunk of this book is all side treks, diverting away from the main situation at hand, resulting in a novel about nothing. This really makes the book very boring and pointless. I then found myself wanting to put the book down quite often after only reading a few pages.<br />The second element to a good book is a good protagonist, or main character. The main character in this book, Holden, is a kind of protagonist that many just don't like. He is your stereotypical rich snob, coming from a wealthy family who can afford to send him from one school to another. He also has a snotty, pessimistic attitude about life, other people, and himself. To all the people around him, they're all &quot;phony&quot; and he's better than them, but when he thinks about himself, he degrades himself also. I was able to relate holden tomany people in my school which once again showed the detail of this book. I beleive this is very hypocritical, but he admits that in the book. He also gets very depressed easily, so you don't really see a happy side to this person, or any side that would say he's motivated to do something, or anything for that matter. He just brags about his sister, drinks, treats women poorly, and spends a ton of money, all while under heavy depression. Holden is the kind of person you either feel sorry for, or just want to smack in the face. Both feelings are not feelings a reader should have about the protagonist.<br />The overall mood of this book is the final element that makes me want to put the book down after a few pages. Holden's attitude gets him into lots of trouble and lots of bad situations. From one encounter to another, it all ends in sadness and depression. Imagine having to read one depressing story to another, in perfect detail. The only good thing I can say about the mood is that the author writes it very well. However, when I read this book, I always had to stop myself from getting myself depressed after reading all of Holden's misadventures.<br />To summarize, imagine sitting in front of a rich pessimist and hearing him ramble on and on and on about everything. There would be no point, no happiness, and no end. Imagine having to hear the rambler for a grade. Can't stand it? Neither could I. Sorry Mr. Salinger, but please put your writing skill to better use. As much as I respect the quality work of this author, I couldn't stand reading this book....",2004-03-28

While Holden is a whiny, unambitious teenager, his observations on life and the world around him suggest a sadly wasted intellect.  As a teacher, this is the aspect of the novel that draws me to it.<br />In the beginning, Holden is telling his story from an unnamed place, where he claims he &quot;came out here to take it easy.&quot;  He confesses that he doesn't want to share his life story, but rather a few interesting days in which he was expelled from a prep school and made the concious decision not to return home, to roam the streets instead.  He cleverly describes that day as &quot;that kind of crazy afternoon, terrifically cold, and no sun out or anything, and you felt like you were disappearing every time you crossed a road&quot;(5).  And so Holden's misadventure begins.<br />One of the most common complaints involving this novel is its negative language.  This is simply a reflection of Holden's pessimistic and negative outlook.  Regardless, he is surprisingly insightful.<br />Perhaps the most outstanding scene of the book is when Holden has discovered graffiti at his sister's school, the &quot;f-word&quot; in fact.  He is angry, thinking of his sister discovering it.  Holden rambles in his own way about how nothing is sacred:  &quot;That's the whole trouble.  You can't ever find a place that's nice and peaceful, because there isn't any.  You may think there is, but once you get there, when you're not looking, somebody'll sneak up and write &quot;F--- you&quot; right under your nose.  I think, even, if I ever die, and they stick me in a cemetery, and I have a tombstone and all, it'll say &quot;Holden Caulfield&quot; on it, and then what year I was born, and what year I died, and then right under that it'll say &quot;F--- you&quot;(204).<br />In spite of Holden's whiny, negative personality, it is the spark of hope and wasted intelligence in him that gives this novel its life.

I like the straightforward way that Holden tells the story; to me at least, it wasn't hugely emotional or descriptive, he just sets these observations down (some of which are very funny.) <br />His excuse for not sleeping with the hooker was that he didn't think he could \\""ever do it with somebody who sits in a movie all day long.\\"" And fair enough. I think he really loved Jane, too. If you read Ghost World (it's not long at all) Enid says the same sort of thing about not wanting to sell goofy gus to a guy with a trendy hairdo. These are honestly, -at least in my experience- the kind of things you think when you're younger. It's not so much being chicken, but I think it's following your heart, and trying not to compromise (even with little things.) I'm still wondering what kind of place in the world kids like Holden and Enid would have.  <br />Holden seems to adjust his behaviour for different sorts of people, as if it's just to gauge them. He's observing them. I watch my younger cousin do this all the time at parties and it's really interesting. Holden sort of goes here and there, meets people and gets along with anyone, but he's perceptive and can see all this \\""phony\\"" stuff that's going on. I don't really think he's being arrogant, because a lot of young people -the age group he mostly hung out with- want to be different. On top of that most people have to act phony for jobs. It's a part of life, sadly.<br />I read through this in a day or two. It's easy to get into. Words like \\""classic\\"" slapped across a book don't really mean a lot to me, and I even was a little wary of it because of all these great reviews, but I really enjoyed it. <br />My favourite time in the book is when he is with Phoebe, it's very sweet.<br />The only thing I didn't like about the book was some of the old phrases and bad language, but that is really minor.",2004-03-25

I thought that the main character Holden Caulfield is very arrogant and opinionated. He knows that he is mentally loose, but he goes on through the story without getting any help. Anyone who has different beliefs than him is a phony. Anytime he is socially insecure about himself he makes a wrong decision, like when he blows the smoke in the nuns face. Holden is especially uneasy about his relation ship with girls. In my opinion all he really needs is to lose the attitude and to listen to someone that can help him.   <BR>The part of the novel that I did enjoy was when Holden finally went home to visit phoebe. Holden has a true appreciation to her innocence. This is the final reason on why he stays home and does not go out west. I also liked the fact that the story began and ended in the mental hospital, which helps to explain some of Holden's mental trouble. Holden uses some language that shows his instability and why he has failed out of three schools. <BR>I think that Holden feels that he has to keep up to his fathers' standard as his two brothers did. In my opinion part of the reason for his mental breakdown is due to the death of his brother Allie. He references Allie several times in the novel when he is asked what makes him happy. Again this relates to the loneliness and depressing attitude of the story.

I've heard numerous references to it through the years. Before killing John Lennon, Mark Chapman, who read and re-read the book many times - to the point of believing it was his own biography, asked Lennon to autograph his copy before gunning down the musician. John Hinckley, attempted assassin of Ronald Reagan, was another devotee of the short novel, as was Robert Bardo, killer of Rebecca Schaeffer (star of &quot;My Sister Sam&quot; on TV). There may be countless other criminals and stalkers who have identified with the book's main character, Holden Caulfield.  In Mel Gibson's movie, &quot;Conspiracy Theory,&quot; his character has an obsession with the book and must buy a copy every time he sees one.<br />I finally had to pick up a copy and find out what all the fuss was about. Was the book about stalking and murder? Not exactly - but rather the motivating factor behind such heinous crimes of obsession.<br />Caulfield, in his late teens, is a misfit in a world that doesn't tolerate misfits very well. His younger brother, who he dearly admired for being so likeable and genuine, has died of cancer. His older brother, D.B., lives in Hollywood, writing stories for the big screen, which is a loathsome thought for Caulfield.<br />Caulfield is an introspective youth who hates being around fake people (who doesn't?), but doesn't try to get to know people well enough to find out whether they are really phony or not. He stumbles through life with his arms crossed in defiance, believing he's one of the few genuine people in the world.<br />Growing up in an affluent home, being shuttled from one prep school to another, Caulfield finds himself ensconced with phonies and it makes him sick to his stomach. His refusal to acclimate results in him being kicked out of one school after another. The novel opens with his narrative of how he has been kicked out of Pencey, his latest prep school, and how he doesn't want to face his parents until they've gotten the news and calmed down a bit.<br />He heads up to New York, getting a room in a fleabag hotel, then running from bar to bar, trying to find something that won't bore him. He's obsessed with avoiding boredom at all costs.  He's constantly finding himself in situations where he fantasizes about killing people, but never defends himself because, he explains, he's &quot;yellow.&quot;<br />His inability to focus and attempt to express himself makes him frustrated and angry, finding contempt and hate for just about anyone for any reason, even those he loves.  The story takes the reader on a rollercoaster ride of 2 and a half days as Holden Caulfield searches for meaning in his life, but finds only emptiness. The only thing he can seem to hold onto is the fantasy of building a cabin out in the middle of nowhere, where he never has to be around phonies again... he'd rather be alone, than lonely in the midst of crowds of phony-baloneys.<br />After reading the book, it's easy to understand how such misfits as Hinckley, Bardo and Chapman used this book as their personal anthem and almost as a proxy, felt the need to act out in ways that Holden Caulfield was unable or unwilling to do. To the sane reader, Caulfield's character is a study in sadness and loneliness, not a character worth admiring - albeit his search for the truth in life is a noble cause.<br />The book doesn't condone or condemn Caulfield, but rather states Caulfield's thoughts as they come to him. The sane reader can't help but want to reassure Caulfield that this is part of growing up and everything is going to be ok, and wonder where such people were in the lives of the famous stalkers who never had anyone reach out to them and slap them with some reality.<br />As someone with ADHD, I found the book a fairly easy read. Parents should know that the book is wrought with foul language and sexually suggestive narratives. As a minor, Caulfield smokes, drinks and attempts to procure the services of a prostitute, among other things... so this is not light reading nor should this be the reading material of a young person not mature enough to separate fact from fiction.

It proves to be a timeless classic to me.  Many times when I try and sit down to read a book I can read it for a while but eventually slip away from it, and never finish what I started.  I found this to be one of those books that kept me interested the whole time though.  The one thing I would compare this book to would have to be the classic sitcom Seinfeld.  The reason for this is simply because they are both very well written and regard things we all relate to in some way, but in the end when all is said and done don't have a major plot to it that really jumps out at you.  Of course I do not mean this in the bad way at all.  I really enjoyed this intricate and groundbreaking way the whole book is brought together.  The book is narrated the whole way through by the main character, Holden Caulfield, starting as he has just recently been expelled from his last school, Pencey Prep.  Pencey Prep is different from most other schools.  To attend the school you must stay in dorms they have like you would for college.  It is also broken into semesters with a christmas break splitting up the 2 semesters. The Catcher in the Rye takes you on Holden's journey as he decides to leave Saturday night before everyone else who will be going home for Christmas break on that next Wednesday.  It follows him as he travels around New York.  He isn't going home yet because he is waiting for his parents to get the letter of his expulsion and giving them time to cool off.  Although it is many people's belief that Holden is, as he would call himself, &quot;a madman&quot;, as I read the book I couldn't help but relate myself to him in some ways.  He really is the epitome of a teenage guy in many ways, just in a way over-dramatized.  It's my belief he really has a good heart.  It's just sad he doesn't see anyone's actions as &quot;real&quot;.  He interacts with everyone the same as mostteenagers really, he just won't see past the negative in people.  It's funny how he creates excuses for things just like any teen would too.  For example he's &quot;never in the right mood&quot; to call Jane, a neighbor of his when he's at home, who you can tell he has a big crush on.  This is really in my perspective just him doing what all of us seem to do by creating an excuse he views as a good reason not to do something that he really wants to do deep inside.  I think he does this because of fear of rejection in some ways and also nervousness.  The one thing he never will put down is his family.  I really like the fact that no matter what other flaws you may see in him u will not see a moral decay when you look at the way he treats his family.  He loves and respects all his family members and is very genuine in his feelings for them.  The book basically concentrates on Holden, the main character, struggling with great depression that's overcome him.  He can't get away from it.  He tries to overcome it by talking with others all the time but keeps turning the people he talks with away for some flawed reason. He's trying to fit in this society but at the same time pushing himself away.  We all can relate to this, especially as teens, when you want to see the reasons behind things we all are obligated to do, such as getting our education in school, but sometimes find ourselves becoming fed up with the way our system is.  I hold this up as one of the best books I have read to date, and highly recommend you read this book no matter who you are.",2004-03-05

I first heard about the book from a friend, and he told me it was one of the most enjoyable books he had ever read.  I was shocked to hear this, because my friend is one of those kids that only reads a book if he has to, and he usually doesn't enjoy anything he reads.  So, I took his advice and read \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" and to my surprise, I wasn't able to put the book down.  The reasons I couldn't stop reading was that I enjoyed the fact that I was reading about a kid who is roughly my age who has a lot of problems and events going on in his life, just like any other teenager.<BR> Holden, who is the main character in the story, is one of the reasons why I liked the book.  Holden is someone who I would say to be a semi-normal teenager.  He is normal in the fact that he isn't sure about the world, and he always wants to experience what others are experiencing.  He constantly feels the need to be sexually involved with a woman, and goes to such extent as to flirt and dance with women that are 3 times as old as he is.  Holden's character is very entertaining, because he is so rebellious.  One way he is rebellious is the fact that he has failed out of three schools, and when the story begins, he has just failed out of his fourth.  He entertained me because, he is always mad about something.  He likes a girl named Jane Gallagher, who he has dated in the past, but his roommate Stradlater is dating her now.  This angers Holden, because Stradlater is constantly teasing Holden about what he does with Jane.  Holden attempts to fight Stradlater, but Stradlater is to strong and the fight ends up with Holden getting a bloody nose, which shows Holden's cocky side.<BR> Even though Holden is going through a tough time in his life, he still has time for his sister Phoebe, who is the one person that makes him happy.  Holden's love for Phoebe is another reason why I enjoyed the book.  I liked the fact that being a big brother to his sister was important to him, it helped show Holden's softer side.  When he got kicked out of school, his sister Phoebe was the only family member that he personally told. He never even told his parents that he was kicked out of school.  That proved to me that Phoebe was very important in Holden's life, and that he was most comfortable around her. <BR> Overall, I would have to say that \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" is a great book.  I was glued to the book the whole way through.  The only aspect of the book that I didn't completely enjoy was the ending.  When the book is concluded, it leaves the reader without a conclusion of Holden's story.  Instead, it allows the reader to decide and predict what will happen to Holden as he journeys to his new school and how the rest of his life turns out.  \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" is a very easy book to read and will be able to keep your attention throughout the whole story.",2004-03-04

One must admire the writing style of Salinger in this book, even if they do not care for the story.  Salinger writes The Catcher as if straight from the mouth of a teenage boy in the 1940's-50's.

Salinger portrayed the character so well that it almost sounded like the book is written vividly through the mind of a 16-year-old teenager.

Wish I had the book in front of me, but to do that I'd have to go back into the bedroom and run the risk of waking my wife.  For Holden, that would be something like &quot;It bugs me when guys are reviewing a book and won't go back into their bedrooms to get it because they are afraid of waking up their wife.

He says it as though it's something that has happened thousands of times over instead of something that just happened.<br />Holden is a lovable, insecure kid who is struggling to &quot;keep it real&quot;, whatever that means.

I really think Holden's struggle in the novel is an authentic one, and it strikes me like my own. Holden is devastated by the loss of his brother Allie. He loved him and the world took him away, and now Holden does not know how to act in such a world. He doesn't know how to be intimate with anyone anymore. He doesn't understand how other adults cope, and he thinks they are phony. Of course, many of them are phonies, and Holden himself has resorted to being one in an attempt to divert himself from the painful realities of living. He would rather project his false self than let his real one be hurt, but Holden, unlike many of those around him, is at least on the way to not being authentic. I think all of his actions throughout the novel center around his struggle with pain. He is either trying to divert himself (with Sunny and Sally) or he is trying to fight through it (with Phoebe and possibly, Jane).

In fact, I would strongly recommend this book to be a must read in high school's across the country due to its extraordinary portrayal of a troubled teen in society. I give this book 4 out of 5 stars.<br />Mrs. Spehar is the greatest teacher in the world!",2004-01-19

This book is one of the most honest and true books I have ever read. Holden, the main character in the book, gives his thoughts about people and everyday life. Just reading about the reality of these thoughts kept me wanting to read more the whole time. You get caught up in his opinions and views and forget that he is only a sixteen-year old boy. It was refreshing to read something and to feel like it wasn't sugar coated or only part of the truth. <BR> The book as a whole did not show an overwhelming amount of love or compassion, but there is one certain area when it did. Holden admits to not liking many people. However, the person to whom he cares most about, in my opinion, is his younger sister, Phoebe. When he shows his feelings for her, it makes the effect greater because he does not do this for anyone else. It provides an escape from all of the negativity and therefore makes you appreciate it even more so. He treats Phoebe with great love and respect, in spite of the fact that she is only a child. This warms you and lets you even more into the heart of Holden. <BR> If you look deeper into the novel, you will notice that it is about loneliness as well as the need of others. Holden's loneliness strikes out at you as throughout the book he continues on his search for a girl. He mentions at several times that he does not like being with a girl names Sally, yet he creates this extravagant idea of them sneaking off and getting married together. This shows how lonely he actually is. I believe it is easy to relate to him because he shows how he is scared of change, and in some ways, relationships. I liked that aspect of the book.<BR> Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading more about thought and feelings over a significant plot. I enjoyed reading it and believe many others will as well. I appreciated the truth in it and how easily it was toapply to your own life at times. Catcher in the Rye is definitely worth your time.",2004-01-16

He was explaining to his little sister, Phoebe, how he wants to protect children from being corrupted by adulthood.  <BR>     Anyone who read this book would agree with me when I say that Holden Caulfield is a very unique individual.  He uses the word `phony' to describe just about everyone around him.  Although I found him to be quite odd, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel.  It was, at times, comical, and exhibits the thinking process of this sixteen year old boy very clearly.  He explains the method to his madness, and how much he dislikes all that is not genuine in this world.  I felt like I knew Holden personally by the end of his story.  He gave such an intimate description of his life from the time he got kicked out of Pency to his return home.<BR>     The way that the book was written exactly how he would have spoken, made it easy for me to read.  I felt like I was having a conversation with Holden. The characters described in the novel were very realistic.  I could just picture his family, teachers, the boys in his dorm, and all of the people he came in contact with while he was in New York.  <BR>     The Catcher in the Rye is an excellent book.

The book is told by Holden Caulfield and the days before his Christmas vacation break. He is a troubled boy with depression problems that will be visible encounter as the book is told by him. The part I thought was interesting is how a person can exclude themselves from the world and become depressed.  Holden attended Pencey Prep, and all boys' school. This would be the fourth school he attended and got kicked out of or chose to leave. I believe if he is already on the fourth school, something must be wrong. I feel bad that this keeps happening to him, but it is also his fault for allowing it to happen. Holden is now being kicked out of Pencey Prep, he didn't apply himself so his grades where really poor and they asked him to leave the prep school.  The major problem that he has with this world is that he thinks that everyone is phoniness. I think he is also phony because there is a guy Ackley who he can't stand but he still talks to and is kind of nice to. Holden decides to leave early from Pencey before Christmas break starts. He and his room mate got in a big fight over a girl.  Holden gathers all of his belonging and catches a train to New York City where his family lives. He doesn't go home to his families' apartment. He decides to spend two days consuming alcohol and loneliness in New York.  I think he should have gone home to get help from his family other then getting drunk and not solving any of his real problems. His problems were still there when he became sober the next morning. Also if he went home he wouldn't be lonely because he would have his little sister and his parents there with him. He decides once his money is gone, nothing can get any worst so he goes back home to his parent's apartment and visit his sister Phoebe. She seems to be the only person he is able to communicate with in the entire book.  After talking to Phoebe he feels better and decides to see an older teacher of his before his parents get home. He visits with Mr. Antolini thinking that it would make him better but really he leaves his house feeling more depressed. He doesn't understand how hid world is so full of phoniness and thinks it is such a horrible place to grow up in.  I feel bad for him because he needs help, his world can be bad but with his problem it is making it so much worst and harder for him to live in.  He all the sudden decides that he is going to move West. The first person he thinks about telling first is Phoebe, he meets her in the park and watchers her with fright as she plays. Holden decides that there can be no catcher, that all you can do is hope kids develop in this harsh world on their own.  Holden is now being hospitalized and recovering from his illness that had taken over him. I hope he comes out seeing the world differently and isn't as lonely, and is able to make a direction for himself. I thoroughly liked this book. It wasn't a happy cheerful book but you got to see inside someone with an illness of this kind. There are so many people suffering with this disease and it is so hard to understand how this could happen to a person but it occurs everyday.",2004-01-16

He then wanders around New York City, avoids going home with the one exception of visiting his sister, and does not tell his parents about flunking out. <BR> <BR>     I liked this book for a number of reasons.  I felt it was easy to relate to his feelings, and Salinger easily shows what is going through this teen's mind.  There were many times in the book where I just couldn't put it down. I wanted to know what would happen next.  With so many twists and turns, the only way to find out was to read on. <br />     However, the negative side of this book also revolves around the thoughts and emotions of Holden. Many times throughout the book, the same emotions are displayed, where Holden says the same reaction about people.  It becomes annoying when he says the same phrase over and over again.<BR> <BR>     Despite those negatives, I enjoyed reading this book and look forward to reading again in the near future.  This book was highly controversial in past years, especially in the late 1960's.

When I first started the book I thought it was going to be another boring classic. But I was wrong. I completely loved the book. <br /> Holden Caufield is the main character and narrator of the novel. He is very cynical which I found amusing. He tells this wild story about 3 days of his life before Christmas break. As I was reading the book it seemed like a lot more than 3 days.<br /> I think Salinger did an excellent job writing this book. He wrote this book and it wasn't really based on anything. It didn't have some huge plot structure or anything fancy. The book just had extremely well developed thoughts and characters. I simply couldn't just put the book down I read almost the whole thing at once. What made me stop was the fact that it was 3 AM!<br /> On some levels I could relate to Holden's despair at being in a world full of weirdo's and wackos. And also highly dislike or hate most of the people around you. But you have to put up with them because they are the only ones around. The Catcher in the Rye is a good vehicle to demonstrate how society was taking a turn for the worse. Like in the one part he keeps talking about how sick it is how he keeps seeing \\""F@%$ You\\"" written all over the wall.<br /> Salinger uses a lot of popular slang consistent with the setting of the story, which made reading tedious at times because I didn't understand half of it.

For instance, in the movie \\""The Good Girl\\"", the angsty youth gave himself the name \\""Holden\\"" and for obvious reasons:  he identified with the cynicism of the character and his adolescent contempt for the world around him.  Problem is, of course, that's not the point of the story.<br />It's humorous and had me snickering like an idiot as I read through some of Holden's observations, but the characters deep flaws are not a celebration in themselves.  That was the impression I had gotten from people over the years:  this guy is great because he's jaded like me.  Not that many of his observations weren't dead-on, but to have held this general outlook and not feel sad in some way is to have missed the point altogether.

I really enjoyed reading the book by J.D. Salinger. When I first started the book, I quickly became attached to the character and the thoughts he had expressed. For example, I felt like I related to Holden in numerous ways. The technique that J.D. Salinger articulated  with Holden, his character seemed so real in my mind. I felt that Salinger described the emotions, actions and thoughts of Holden so well that it gave me the impression that he had gone into the minds of teenagers and described almost precisely how they felt as well as the problems that many had. <BR> I personally don't read novels on my own free will, but I could frankly say I enjoyed reading every chapter of this book. It was unpredicted towards the end. However, the last few chapters of the book started to get dreary. I anticipated something more exciting to happen such as someone getting injured or a twist in attitude. Conversely, I really enjoyed how the book ended and the emotion that Holden had experienced during his expedition through the city. <BR> The descriptions that the author described was easily traced in my mind. With no trouble, I was able to imagine Holden and other characters by the way Salinger had described them. I depicted Holden as a tall and lean male with short brown hair, who could effortlessly pass older than his age. I also pictured Holden with his bright red hunting hat on, walking down city streets shivering. Also, through out the rest of the story, I thought that  Holden complained much about things. In some ways, I could understand his point-of-view on things and the impressions he got from people. I assumed he complained about things because perhaps he wanted to get his point across to make the reader understand him a little bit better. Overall, I really enjoyed this book.

Catcher In The Rye is no different, and upon starting this book, I was unable to keep my nose out of it for days. It's hard to say why, but I think it's the combination of the book's content being timeless, relatable, and original.<br />Holden, a typical teenage boy living in the Northeast, finds himself being kicked out of Pencey (his boarding school) on account of his less-than-impressive grades. He leaves prior to that, however, presumably to escape the dreary school life that seems to have been bothering for quite some time. He decides to go home, but not without encountering two days in the Big Apple. The actual text, however, is much like a live diary of Holden's thoughts as he encounters various people and flashbacks of his foggy past. Of course, the theme sounds a little drab on paper, but Salinger's way of conveying this young character with an impressive wit and intelligence makes the reader addicted to the story. It's so real and timeless that you can often find yourself forgetting that you're reading a book that was written 50-plus years ago. Many of the characters don't stick around longer than a few chapters in the book, but each and every one of them reveals so much of their personality despite the fact that Holden is the only character that sticks around until the end of the book. It's Salinger's way of making things seem so authentic that makes this book so brilliant. <br />It's easy why to see this book is such a staple in American literature; it's trendy, it's classic, and it doesn't waste time giving the reader too much to analyze. It's moving literature without the dreary focus on making EVERYTHING have an underlying meaning (which is the reason why so many teenagers don't enjoy reading today).

Throughout the novel, Holden encounters many different women, for mostly the same reason, and need I say more. The boy is just 16 years old, and has been kicked out of school for his grades/actions numerous times, without his parents really caring or knowing about him and his education. I find that hard to believe that the parents of today's age would allow their child to go through this. Even though this story takes place in the 1950's, i still do not believe parents in that day and age would allow it either. <br /> When Holden Caulfield runs away from school before Christmas break, I find it hard to believe that all of the people of Manhattan, wouldn't question him. Why a 16 year old boy would be able to check into a hotel by himself, and go into a few bars with 30 year old ladies and be served. Correct me if I'm wrong, I beileve that you have to be at least 18 years old to check into a hotel room, and 21 years of age to be served alcohol in New York.<br /> The one part of this novel that I did enjoy was how Holden speculates the people in the society he lives in are so dumb that they would actually write a four letter word, followed by a &quot;you&quot;, on his tombstone. Even though I can't see that happening, I found that very humorous. I also love the fact that he calls everyone &quot;phony&quot;, when really I think he is phony. He seems like he is the person who has a negative outlook on everything in the world, except towards the end of the novel, when he is optimistic about his future.<br /> Overall, I'd rate this 3 stars out of 5, which in my mind isnt too bad. There were many points in the novel that made me laugh and really think about some things. But what brought the score down was, I didn't like how Salinger had the society play dumb in the novel. There are numeroustimes where Holden gets away with things that in my mind, would be shocking if he were to do the same in today's world. If Iwere to recomend this book, I would recomend it too mature teenagers who like fictional stories.

There were also a lot of other funny parts but I remember that one the most because I was at the airport going out to California to see my mom and I only see her once a year.

Most reading this will know the story of Holden Cauldfield and his little oddysey during the Christmas season of 1949.  I first had this book assigned to me by a young lit teacher when I was about Holden's age.  It was my first really serious, critical book report.  What I liked about it at the time was its brevity but I did get a good grade on the report which was held up to the class as the standard for such an endeavor.  It was only during my second reading about ten years later that it occured to me why that teacher had chosen me to report on Catcher in the Rye.  I feel that many read far too much into the story and how it is told.  When it came out in 1951 it was not just controversial, it was considered downright subversive and banned in many places.  Today one can only assume that the four times the F-word is used in the original version was the impetus for such a reaction.  Actually, it is just the story of an intelligent and insightful but troubled teenage boy for whom the pressures of looming adulthood and the recent death of a sibling are too much to bare, leading to a breakdown and the catharsis of this telling.  Sure he is critical of others and of life but he never spares himself in his criticism.  Yes, we can assume that he has in him some of the phoniness that he so vehemently decries.  &quot;Let he who is . . . .&quot;  However, through Holden Cauldfield we can see through so much of the unreality of everday human experience and interaction.

Now Holden did have money that he had saved up so he went to hotels and bars and aventually turned to getting girls weather they were ones he met at clubs, bars or even a prostitute once. He didnt want his family to know that he had gotten kicked out yet again, like any normal teenager, so he decided to only go home to see his sister late at night. He loved his sister, basically because he could talk to her, even if she was really upset that he got kicked out.

Holden went through many money issues and even being manipulated by people of the outside world that he didnt even know. He lived by the day at either hotels or at old teachers houses.

He dosent really tell you what is going to happen in his future maybe because he dosent know. you can tell by the end of the book that he is tired of people asking him questions about applying himself and wanting to go to school and all of that but he dosent know nor it seems like he dosent care what really happens, and teens act the same way, that is why I think that this book is a fantastic book to read if you are a teen.",2003-12-31

Told as a monologue, the book describes Holden's thoughts and activities over these few days, during which he describes a developing nervous breakdown, depression, and odd, erratic behaviour, prior to his eventual nervous collapse.<br />Holden begins by saying that his account will not give any moral message. He will not tell about his &quot;lousy&quot; childhood and &quot;all that David Copperfield kind of crap&quot; because such details bore him.

The book, which came out in 1951, still has a universal appeal to it. It describes the angst, alienation that a 'cynical adolescent' faces. This turns him into a rebel who hates people, judges people and often runs away.<br />The book was banned in America after its publication, which added to its mystique and appeal. The book was considered 'obscene', 'filthy and profane', 'immoral' and has often upset people due to its rebellious views.

There is nothing truly rebellious about him.<br />A classic to me is a book that stands the test of time. This book has certainly failed to maintain its initial relevance over the years. Still, it is not too bad as a regular adolescence book.",2003-12-24

Okay, the plot affects his actions and state of mind, but if you're expecting an ending that wraps everything up in a nice neat bow then you may as well read some trashy murder mystery. <BR>I think this books main problem is the hype that surrounds it. Salinger's fame as a recluse (how can you be a famous recluse?) has certainly led to a cult status for 'Catcher in the Rye' that definitely helps book sales, but I think it may hinder enjoyment.<br />I liked this book a lot. It's not the best book I've ever read, but it is a good book. I can understand people who had a problem with the language use, some of the slang expressions are long since forgotten and have to be deciphered through the context, it is also written how Holden would say it rather than in a more literary way. This just makes him more appealing as a character. <br />Holden is not the nicest of characters, you're not supposed to love everything he does or says (or at least I didn't). He is a flawed person, he has serious mental issues. He has built up a wall in his mind against these 'phonies' and continues to repeat his hatred for these people when he is secretly one of them. If you can tell what he's going to say next, Great! that just proves what a phony HE really is. That's good character writing.<br />This book isn't life changing or genius or anything like that, but it is entertaining and that's all a book needs to be.<BR>It's short, I doubt if there is a chapter more than 10 pages long, and I thought it was really easy to read.<BR>If you just want something good, not too challenging but interesting, to read on a rainy day I'd recommend this book.<BR>If your looking for a book with a hero that, in the end, gets the girl, you should probably do a search for Mills and Boon.",2003-12-24

I thought such a classic and highly regarded book could not possibly be endorsing Holden's meek frustration, ironic arrogance, and outright paranoia. I was waiting for this book to contrast Holden's senselessness with a clear-thinking and stable character, but such a contrast never came. The possibility remains that the author was offering a VERY subtle criticism of Holden, but this book just doesn't seem to carry enough intellectual weight to pull off such subtle irony.<br />The book details three days in the life of it's protagonist Holden Caulfield . It presents him in several situations (some run-of-the-mill and some a little spectactular) and shows how mentally unstable he is. The book then proceeds to blame his mental ills on society, saying that modern society is an alienating place for teenagers. This is true of course, but only for somebody without anything to believe in, somebody cynical, somebody like Holden. The book glorifies Holden's mental instability by making him out to be the victim, somebody who can't help his senselessness.<br />This book would have been great had the author realized that simply detailing sensitive person's alienation is not enough for a good novel. He needs to get to the root of that alientation (Holden's cynicism) and ACTUALLY MAKE A POINT ABOUT IT.

Pencey was the school he attended most recently, being one of many schools he had dropped out of during the past few years. He left school, ventured out on his own in the busy, chaotic city of New York. There, he met up with many acquaintances, experienced the truth in his life, and learned lessons to help improve his future. He faces the decision of what he is to do with his life, and ends up making a predictable pick.<BR>There were many educational, enjoyable scenes in this novel. One that kept me on my toes was when Holden was first beat up by his dorm mate, Stradlater. It was suspenseful, and the way he handled the situation helped reveal his personality. Another exciting part was when Holden met up with a fellow student's mother on a trolley. He told many lies to her, and ended up regretting it after he found out she was a genuine, generous woman, much unlike her own son. When the prostitute arrived at Holden's hotel room, something rotten was bound to happen. The description of this chapter kept me reading. I enjoyed reading about the way Holden described his everyday surroundings, and what he liked, disliked, which was obvious, because he was such an open character. There were many aspects that vexed me, because he was repetitive with his attitude. He seemed to despise nearly everything, all of the time. Even cheap luggage would make an impact on his judgment of a person, and he had many other prejudices along with that. At times, the writing style seemed dull and boring because he irritated the reader with meaningless remarks. Many topics that were discussed seemed quite pointless, and Holden lacked alot of common sense as a character.<BR>I would recommend this novel to readers 14 years and older. Some material is inappropriate for younger people. The book is easy to get into, and mostly keeps you interested. The main characters are complicated and easy to both adore and abhor. The book taught me a lot about life alone through the eyes of a teenager. Because of his peer pressure, he had to make many decisions that hurt him and hurt people he loved.

It's about a boy named Holden who has a nervous breakdown and all of his experiences while this is going on. This book is great, despite the negative feelings that have been formed about it. Let's dive in and see what this book is all about.<BR>This novel is set in New York City during the 1950's.  This New York setting adds lots of excitement and unexpected sights, considering the city holds more than the human eye can see. By doing this, J.D. Salinger allows Holden, the main character to be set in a \\""world\\"" within a world. By this, I mean that the excitement and unexpected sights of the city really adds a fantastic effect and opportunity for the character. This allows Holden to get a sense of an \\""unsafe\\"" place, and an opportunity to meet astonishing characters and be exposed to new situations.     <BR> The book is narrated by sixteen year old Holden Caufield whose experiences form the action of the novel. His history of getting kicked out of schools, the death of his brother and his academic failure have caused him to hate the \\""system,\\"" and the world. These events all lead to his noteworthy emotional breakdown. <BR> Something that I really enjoyed about this book is Holden's language.  Salinger writes from Holden's point of view, using colloquial speech, and a few key terms. By doing this you're able to see what comes out of Holden's mind which gives you his perspective on things.  It's a good way of connecting the reader to the character. An example of his key terms are the words \\""phony\\"" and \\""naturally\\"". He uses the word \\""phonies\\"" to show his negative tone towards people and things he doesn't like; whereas he uses the word \\""naturally\\"" as filler in his speaking.<BR>Unlike many other books, this one has many little climaxes. The first two are when Holden gets in a fight with his roommate and later, when he fights a pimp. He winds up losing both of these and deals with the defeat by running away. The other three climaxes all have to do with rejection. The first of these three is when he calls this girl Sally and sets a date with her, but in the middle of the date she laughs at him and leaves. The second is when his little sister Phoebe doesn't want to listen to him and is disappointed because he was expelled again and the third is when his teacher Mr. Antolini gives him a talk about his school work, and then touches his forehead later that night, which Holden takes as a sexual gesture, and becomes disgusted with him. These climaxes all stress how Holden is constantly faced with defeat and have no one to turn to. The part of the book that really shows this is when he goes to central park to watch the ducks, but one day finds that they're not there anymore. He can't figure out where they went, but this makes him realize that he needs to figure out his purpose and direction. <BR>The conclusion of this book is when Holden realizes that he doesn't fit in with the world and that he feels defeated. He winds up going to a mental hospital, which you learn that he has been narrating the whole book while he was sitting there telling his story to a psychiatrist. Although this book is thought to be very controversial, it is a great example of a real life situation and was very well written.",2003-12-02

Holden Caulfield has a perspective most of us agree with but seldom express. Especially a feeling among tweens and teens about the world of adults where there is so much disingenuousness and posturing (phoniness in Holden's words) to cover up ulterior motives and advance one's personal agenda.

During the four days he is gone, he encounters several unusual experiences. I did like this book, a lot actually, but certain times during the book it got confusing and sometimes a little annoying because some of the things Holden did, specifically the way he was judgmental of a lot of people before he even knew them. <br />Throughout the book I appreciated the way he was against `phoney' people. He wanted people to be real with him, but it seemed like whenever someone was being real with him, he was always thinking to himself about how that person was a phoney.  I was left wondering what \\""being real\\"" was with Holden, and it was hard to define because the only person he really didn't call a phoney was Phoebe. I didn't really like the ending, either. It was odd because he was kind of building up to the end of the book, and then he just said, \\""I don't feel like telling you what happened next.\\""  It was weird, but at the same time I expected that from Holden. <br />Even though Holden sometimes was arrogant and unpleasant, I believe that is the way the book is supposed to be.

That's the joke. And it's funny. Yeah, it's cute to watch Holden give all those young kids his tips, since he's as clueless as they come about the world around him; or watch Holden admit, just a tad, when he's wrong. He's tremendously likeable to us (even if he must come off as a jerk to everyone in the book not privy to our insider information) because we see all his insecurities; it certainly has a therapeutic effect on the teenage mind that thinks he's all alone in the world, and Salinger mentions this near the end of the novel, of course. <br />You could hardly say the book is profound in ideas -- the closest it comes is that bit about the suitcases -- but it is an important book, obviously, and a good one because, even if we're not in Holden's economic situation (and even if we're not growing up in the '40s and '50s), nearly everything he says stays relevant. (Well, maybe not the part about the frozen fish, but doesn't every teenage brain imagine leaving everyone behind and starting life anew?) All that's changed is the degree of cursing. (What's written on the wall that shocks Holden into anger is kinda funny, seen from today's perspective.) I haven't read Salinger's other stuff so I can't compare, but it strikes me as far too easy to criticize this book for its thin vocabulary -- Salinger lays it on so thick as to become comical and has Holden himself mention it once or twice, for chrissakes.<br />One thing most of us are interested in when we read a novel or watch a movie (not Holden on the latter, I realize, though I wonder what he'd think about Brando in a few years) is to be planted in some other world. Here, the world is sparsely described to us, but it's neat to put yourself -- as I did -- in the shoes of someone of the time. Where words like &quot;flit&quot; were used; or where Holden says &quot;colored&quot; people, which is indicative of the times, and then goes and overcompensates by telling us a white musician could never be as good as a black one because she'd made a song too cute. I get a bit of a thrill when I read stuff like that, a little ahead of its time. Holden even has a reasonably modern view of &quot;flits&quot; for someone his age. (Maybe all that time around the &quot;gorgeous&quot; Stradlater influenced him...)

I live in Los Angeles, land of many \\""phonies\\""--the same type that Holden appeared to be criticizing.  Holden wants to be a genuine human being, one who can actually be himself.  Instead of playing a role in life, Holden wants to live life.  It is quite unfortunate that the life Holden wants to lead is not really achievable.  We all have roles to play, whether we want to play them or not.  Witness the scene where Holden calls up a prostitute -- and, in Holden's character, he does not play the role he's supposed to lead -- where he enganges in sexual behavior with her.<br />Instead, Holden wants to learn about the prostitute.  He cares for her.  He wants to talk to her.  Discuss things.  Isn't that strange?  Totally out of character.  It is not what one would expect.  That's Holden.<br />Perhaps one of the biggest problem, though, is that people who do not want to be a \\""phony\\"" -- those who would prefer to, in Thoreau's words, \\""march to their own drummer,\\"" have a difficult time.  Holden doesn't have many friends.  He seems like a drifter.  Doesn't really do well in school.<br />Is this a lesson to be learned?  Are the bums on the street former Holden's, unable to adjust to reality, drifting to find their authenticity somewhere in the world?

Salinger's lively narrative makes &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; irresistably funny and fascinating, as well as troubling.   Salinger shows a terrific ear for dialogue -- not just spoken conversation, but also the fast-spinning thoughts of Holden Caulfield, the book's 16-year-old protagonist.<br />Caulfied is a teenager overflowing with negativity, sarcasm and cynicism. He seems to hate almost everything, including movies, actors, cheap luggage, guys who shake hands too hard, friends who yawn when asking for a favor, and people who say &quot;good luck.&quot;<br />It might seem that such relentless negativity would drag a book down, but Salinger offers just enough glimpses beneath Holden's bitter exterior for the reader to discover an endearing, but troubled, boy underneath. For example, he takes a curious interest in what happens to Central Park's ducks when winter comes.  Though this book was written in the 1940s, you can't help thinking -- in light of the Columbine shootings and other teen violence -- about how it can help us understand today's troubled youths.   <br />There are two things that keep me from giving this five stars.

Sure, his sister and a teacher both challenge his attitudes in the latter part of the book, but he still hates the &quot;stupid questions&quot; everyone asks.

I'm a sucker for sarcasm, and Holden is full of it.  Second, this is also one of the most touching books I've ever read. The scene between Holden and Phoebe comes particularly to mind.  <br />This book has often been criticized for the hyper-critical temperment of it's protagonist.  This is a shame, and an ironic one, since these reviewers entirely miss the point, like reading the gospels and poo-pooing the crucifixion without regard to the ressurection.  True, Holden, due to his hightened sensitivity, is especially irritable and intolerant, forever chastizing people (though generally not to their faces, as he is an avowed coward; no less critical of himself than of others) for everything under the sun, and in particular, for being phony.  But, the attentive reader will notice that after nearly all of these self-righteous tirades he reflects that the people are somehow not to blame for thier faults, which, ugly as they are, only end by inspiring his sympathy.  It makes a profound point, namely, that the things most deserving and in the greatest need of our sympathy and compassion are, more often than not, the things least likely to inspire them (at least, at first glance). One of my favorite lines, to illustrate this point, is \\""'It's no fun being yellow'\\"".  <br />This was my favorite book when i was younger (later supplanted by The Brothers Karamazov) and i must've read it at least four times.  At one point Holden says that he likes books with a little humor in them, books that, when you finish them, make you wish you could sit down with the author and just shoot the bull for a little while.  There's no one i'd rather shoot the bull with than J.D. Salinger.

I found much truth in it; everyone knows a Holden Caulfield, and Salinger nailed the personality. Some passages I would read and think, &quot;That is so true! That is a true piece of thought!&quot; Too often novelists will have their characters speak to a plot, rather than actually have human attributes. Holden Caulfield comes to life in the book.<br />Although I enjoyed the book and appreciated Salinger's truthful writing, it is not a work of literary genius, much less of the best books I have read. It's mildly contemporary, which can be forgiven. But the main quib I had with the book is that Salinger held to the one personality and ran with it too long. In making Holden come to life, he also ran it to the ground, making him flat. Salinger tried to undo this near the end, but I think it was weak writing. <br />All in all, a great book with many truths, but not a complete portrait of a human.

I imagine that Holden's smoking, drinking, and musings about sex may have been shocking at the time, but it's pretty tame stuff today.  Still, I can't help but like a main character who boasts that he's &quot;the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life.&quot;<br />Much of the book seems to be written in a sort of &quot;code.&quot; Little hints along the way indicate that narrator Holden is not being totally honest with us, with himself, or with both--even though on the surface the narrative should be the truth behind the lies he tells to other characters within the story.  What is Holden's real unsaid truth?  I won't give my interpretation, but will leave that to each reader.<br />In the end, &quot;Catcher&quot; is a classic that still commands our attention.

Of course, one has to play it right. Part of Galileo's initial fame came from the efforts of the Church to suppress his writings--as he stayed in Church-dominated areas, he didn't achieve much fortune.<br />Controversy worked well also for J.D. Salinger (Jerome David Salinger). He was an American-born (actually, New York City-born) author whose only enduringly popular piece has been 'Catcher in the Rye', which continues to sell a quarter-million copies annually.<br />'Catcher in the Rye' follows the tale of Holden Caulfield, a boarding-school truant who critiques society and himself in the course of trying to achieve adulthood, most expressly typified by the typical American rite of passage, that of losing one's virginity. Caulfield is in many ways a typical male adolescent, both naive and worldly in an odd mixture; both passionate and violent without mature ways of expression; sullen, withdrawn, yet yearning for acceptance and love.<br />In many ways it has become an anthem or manifesto of violence against a phoney system. The man who shot John Lennon was influenced by this book, as was the man who shot Ronald Reagan. 'What scares me most is the other guy's face...'<br />Of course, to ban this book is to admit that there is something that needs to be considered and dealt with about youthful, and particularly male youthful, drives and desires. So much of society seems inadequate to the task of giving a framework for this. Lest you think I am decrying modern society in favour of a 'Father Knows Best' world, remember -- 'Catcher in the Rye' was published in 1951.

Lawrence, which could have a more prurient element as the focus of the bans -- 'Catcher in the Rye' is in issues of language and sexual expression in no way untypical of many unbanned books. But, it espouses a critique of society that is uncomfortable while using a base language and subject to do so -- this is a combination, a pile of straws with one straw too many, for many jurisdictions to bear.<br />So, as D.H.

It brought new meaning to 'required reading' and sparked debates like few I had ever witnessed before in a classroom.<br />However, a lot of people don't appreciate the writing style of J.D. Salinger.  Brilliance is not always appreciated or recognized, and of course, everyone is entitled to their opinion.  Many people became irritated at the redundant language, excessive affirmations (&quot;It really was, if you want to know the truth&quot;), intense and long digressions, and overall hypocrisy of the character we know as Holden Caulfield.  The way I see it is that Salinger knew exactly what he was doing.  He did not digress for pages at a time simply because HIS mind was wandering.  It was Holden's mind that was straying and the structure of the book mirrors the content perfectly.  Salinger made conscious decisions in this work regarding language and organization, but these only serve to enhance Holden's character.  Eventually, this DOES get annoying... but for many of us, not to the point where we want to put the book down.  It exposes us to Holden, having a feeling for him (probably frustration) that we can relate to human beings.  <br />Regardless of negative criticism, The Catcher in the Rye will continue to be one of the most popular American books regarding adolescence.  Any character that exposes our own fears, our own insecurities, and shares our observations can win us over easily... and Holden Caulfield is no exception.<br />The bottom line is, the book is incredible...  but it's just too much for some people.

I had never read it until this year (my senior year in high school), and was one of the few that hadn't.  I had always figured that since it was a classic, it would be boring;  many classics have been praised by all kinds of critics, and it seemed to me that half the time, the books [are bad] (i.e. Animal Farm, The Red Badge of Courage, Lord of the Flies).  However, what I like about \\""Catcher in the Rye\\"" is that it is written from the main character's point of view, and the way it is written is basically the way the kid talks.  I thought that helped make the book a good one, because the way I see it, the reader can't identify with a seventeen-year-old kid in a book as well if they don't really feel like the kid is talking to them, and when you read this, it feels like the character (Holden) is actually talking to you; he makes a lot of sarcastic, cynical remarks that make the reader chuckle rather frequently, and I thought that added a lot to the character.  Another thing that I think is great about this book is that Holden is one of those kids who is slightly troubled; he's breaking rules left and right, he fails all but one of his classes and has been kicked out of two schools.  When I was reading this, I realized that I know people like that, that I've grown up with kids that did that kind of stuff, and that makes the book all the more interesting.  I think that one mistake that people who have not read this book make is they expect it to be a novel, but it's really more of a character analysis, and if you're into that sort of thing, you'll probably really enjoy this book a lot.  This is one of the few books I actually enjoyed reading in school, the only other being \\""To Kill a Mockingbird.\\""  If you haven't read this book yet, then I highly recommend that you do.

Holden Caulfield is a lazy, cynical teen in 1950s America and he has just left his third prepatory school to return home to his family in New York City.  His parents are expecting him home on a Wednesday, yet it is Monday, so the events of the novel unfold over two days in the Big Apple.  <BR>The theme that struck me the most was the one of trying to grow up too early.  Holden is very much like this.  He presents himself as a mature figure, smoking, drinking, hanging out in clubs, yet in his personal relationships with people, he acts quite immature.

I believe it would have been an improvement if Salinger had given us a look into other character's minds so we could see their perspective.  This is an especially important flaw because Holden, at his center, constantly wonders what others think of him.   <BR>I would recommend this novel to teenagers, especially those who feel they do not fit into their particular environment.

Because he had flunked out of three or four other schools, he waited around in New York City for the day when all of his classmates went to Christmas vacation before he went home to break the news of his expulsion to his parents. In those several days, he gets drunk, goes on dates, wanders the streets and even sneaks a visit to his apartment to visit his sister, Phoebe. Holden tells Phoebe that what he really wants to do is be the catcher in the rye; that when all of the little kids were playing games in the rye he would be the person to catch the kids before they fell off the cliff. He wouldn't play the games with the kids, but he would just help them to not fall off the cliff. This means that Holden felt like an outsider and longed to be included, but deep in his heart he really wanted to help people. <BR> Holden Caulfield's cynical attitude toward everybody and everything gives him the different personality that he has and makes his story a good read. At times you just laugh at the book because some of the things he does are so stupid and thickheaded. In the end, you will find that Holden Caulfield is a troubled boy who thinks that the world is out to get him and make him do things that he does not want to do.",2003-05-02

Salinger's Catcher in the Rye is a timeless American classic because it exemplifies the effect of corruption in the world on youthful innocence.  Through the eyes and mind of a teenager in the late 1940s Salinger offers insights as to why adolescents rebel, but offers no solution to stop it.  The hypocritical and dubious values set by the adult world cause Salinger's main character, Holden Caulfield, to have a nervous breakdown.  During rehabilitation in a Western infirmary Caulfield has time to reflect on many experiences and people from his past.  This results in a wise-beyond-his-years understanding of the human condition.  The teenager had a moral disgust towards everything cruel, hypocritical, and evil (what Holden called \\""phony\\"") in the world.  Holden's reaction however, was not one of anger or bitterness, but instead sadness at the current society.  Random, all-consuming waves of depression were the result of his self-chosen isolation and uncertainty of where to go in life.  <BR> Salinger used a stream of consciousness style when writing, weaving slang and adolescent satire, with incomplete thought processes to show Holden's inability to smoothly transition from boy to adulthood, and frustrating immaturity.  Caulfield exemplifies the thought processes of many youths when he understandably avoids his parents when expelled from his third pricey boarding school he attended, attempted to use his height to allow him to buy alcohol and drink with adult men, and naively thinks that he has an understanding of love and sex as a 16 year old virgin. However, his ability to see the shallowness of media, and the often insincere actions of men, shows his deeper, more profound side.  Holden is in limbo, no longer a child, but no yet a man.  A lost soul- wishing to delay the inevitable repulsive \\""real world\\"" and responsibilities of adulthood, but intellectually craving more than adolescence can provide.",2003-04-25

My interpretation of this book was neither good or bad.  To me this book, compared to others I have read, was rather mediocre, not that I have read an extremely large amount of books in my lifetime.  For the most part it seemed  that the world Holden describes is very similar to an actual teenagers world.  Also the actions and events that Holden performs or encounters is closely  related to ones that  an actual teenager may face.  These very accurate descriptions of Holden's world that he lives in and the troubleshooting that goes along with it, is what make this book a good read for not only young adults but for everyone.  <br /> The first part of the book that caught my eye was how well the description of his school matched  mine.  It seemed that Holden was a rebel that disliked most \\""preps\\"".  No matter who you are there is always someone in this world that labels others. This example of one label disliking another is easily shown in every school, every day all across America.  Even though Holden does not  like \\""preps\\"" he still seems to cater there needs.  For example his roommate, Warn returns from the football game wanting to borrow Holden's jacket for his date that he is about to attend.  Holden agreeably lends it to him then later finds out that Warn is dating a girl that his coat lending buddy may have feelings for.  The funny part is, after Warn tells Holden who the girl is Holden still precedes to write a paper for his roommate.  Not only does this action relate to me directly but I am sure it relates to others as well.<br /> The  book describes very well the life of a teenager who is juggling and dealing with all the difficulties encountered as an adolescent.  In some cases such as the hooker and her pimp seem to me to be a little farfetched.   In this part of the story line Holden is staying in a New York hotel.  On one of his trips to his room he has a pleasant conversation with the elevator attendant, Maurice, who doubles as a pimp.  This conversation ends with an offer to have one of Maurice's girls to come up to Holden's room.  They then briefly discuss the price and Holden agrees to Maurice's offer.  Later  a hooker named Sunny appears at Holden's door.  These two do little more than talk because Holden is so upset with his situation.  The end of the night comes abruptly and Sunny asks for ten dollars as her fee.  Holden disagrees and only gives her five.  Sunny leaves in a disgruntled manner but soon returns with Maurice to claim the rest of her money. Holden takes a pretty good beating but seems to brush it of as nothing had happened and goes on his way.  This whole scenario to me seems to be extremely corny.  This is the part of the story line that lowered my expectations for the book.  This could happened to an adolescent but is highly unlikely.  <br /> At the end of the book Holden seems to be more scared and confused than when the book began.  It seemed to him that he either had to run away or die, like his brother Allie. His plan was to run away to the west.  He decided that before he left he would have one more conversation with his beloved sister Phoebe. While talking to her, he takes a turn for the better and decides to stop running and stay home.  This ending was wonderful.  Again the book describes life as a teenager perfectly.  Any teenager with a little common sense, a best friend, and something to live for will always make the right decisions.  Holden has some common sense he was just thoroughly confused, his best friend was Phoebe, and all he wanted in life was to be unconfused and loved.<br /> In conclusion the details and realisticness of each scenario written about in this book was amazing although some seemed a little farfetched.  The relationship that this book and real life was equally amazing.  It also seemed that Holden in his journeys as an adolescent was more adult oriented than he knew. This book is a great read for all ages even the people that are only young at heart.",2003-04-21

Yes, the ending was a bit of a surprise but not enough to be handed a 'spectacular realistic ending' title to it.<br />If you like reading more realistic, based on what could really happen in your youth life books, then I recommend this.

The style flowed easily, and the author quickly painted a perfect picture of the character by using the language that had no holds barred.  It is because of this language that I have to agree with a reveiwer who said &quot;Salinger is subtle, and yet wonderfully blunt&quot;.  <br />I was also impressed with how the author developed his  character, and never strayed from the foundations he a laid.  Not once did Holden seem unlike Holden. <br />The Catcher in the Rye is a classic. Salinger so perfectly put himself into the shoes of an angry and depressed teen that it's almost impossible to think that anyone but Holden actually penned the novel.

Ok, the beginning of my review could seem a bit cheesy but the impact this book had on me was so striking that i don't even know where i should start from. However, the more you read about the \\""madman stuff\\"" that happened to Holden Caulfied in a cold December in NY city after he got kicked out of prep school, the more sympathy you feel for him, the more thoughts and feelings you share with him. He's just a nonconformist teenager that really hates movies and hypocrisy, has to deal with a lot of peers and adults that turn out to be extremely phony and ready to deceive each other for their personal interest. He realises his perception of the world is different from the one he had in his childhood, when everything seemed fine and everybody loyal to one another. Therefore he wishes he could look after all the young kids who aren't yet aware of the hypocrisy that affects human beings and these feelings are really strong whenever he's next to his little sister Phoebe, who could be regarded as the epitome of sincerity and need of protection.<BR>You will fall in love with Holden's forthright way of thinking, you'll end up sticking up for him during the tons of arguments he has with \\""phony bastards\\"" such as his arrogant and conceited roommate Stradlater or a pimp that tries to fix him up with a young prostitute, you'll get very emotional when reading about Holden's deceased brother Allie, you'll be amused when the starring of this book is taking the piss out of his nerdy roommate Ackley, you'll get really involved while reading about the topsy and turvey relationship Holden has with girls and sex, you'll be glued to the pages of the book when Holden narrates about the good time he had with Jane - a girl he is very fond of - and how different she is from the others, you'll end up taking a taxi and asking the driver whether he knows where all the ducks and coots go inthe wintertime when the lagoon is very icy and frozen. You'll change your way of regarding people, I mean, you'll start loving people you are getting along well with, you will literally hate people that do not give you any kind of vibe. <BR>You'll realise how rare Holden's sincerity is, above all in a particular society where a teenager's biggest concern is the quality of his leather suitcases that could look tacky if compared to his roommate's ones.",2003-02-17

Perhaps the archetype for the modern me-against-the-world genre, the book is written and read like its character - on its own terms.<br />One thing I enjoyed reading Catcher(which is a breeze, if you don't know) is Salinger's characterization.  Holden Caufield is a thorougly original literary creation, and this is precisely why he resembles some of us so much.  Making a stand against growing up, the adult world, Caufield's account of life is entirely internalized.  His is a world so many of us encounter in the tender-rough years of the midteens - desolate; the people around us - alien; anything that makes us tick - wrong and immoral.<br />Holden Caufield has become synonymous with rebellion, so much so that it was inevitable for him to become a symbol.  Breathing life and a fierce air of independence into his hero, Salinger made him so understandable because of his own inability to understand anything.  Caufield's inner life, the momentousness of noneventfulness that is the all-too familiar teenageemotional rollercoaster is given full expression.  Neither a novel of adventures nor really a novel of \\""ideas,\\"" you might call this the novel of protest - not of social protest, but of man against the world.  <br />Caufield is the expression of our latent dissatisfaction and bitterness with the way life shoves us along and time steals itself.  He is the audacity to walk out on a dishonest lecture class, to escape the friends who all seem so ignorant during a soul crisis, to ditch the drudgery of duty and responsibiliies on a whim.  Caufield is Peter Pan with a drinking habit and leery eyes.  He has vigor and the failure of rebellion.  Caufield is a palpable reality of the man who tries to step outside the sphere of the life he's thrown into.  He finds the door, but finally sees it's lonely on the other side.  Much like the choices we make when we open the door, Caufield steps back.",2003-01-13

At the crossroads of his adolescent life, he finds himself kicked out of yet another private school. On a cold winter night, before winter break is to let out we follow Holden on a journey of self discovery and acceptance as he makes his way home for Christmas. Holden is an intelligent guy who simply cannot find any meaningful relationships with the people he meets because he is depressed and bored with life. As we follow Holden, he narrates his past through his thoughts and reflections on his life up until this point. There is tragedy in the loss of his brother, but more love than he even realizes when speaking of his family and past friendships. Holden meets many interesting people on his way home, and you live through these experiences with him by Salinger's brilliant narration.

Holden Caulfield demonstrates perfect adolescent behavior through his angry tones, bitter actions, and negative attitudes.<BR>       The story begins when Holden is given the axe at his prep school in New York, which leads him to a few days of freedom out on the streets in NYC.  Personally, the idea is genius.  A sixteen-year old boy struggling with adulthood and responsibilities needs nothing more that time alone to clear his head.  This is where J.D. Salinger throws much adventure and excitement into his novel.  I wouldnt exactly call it suspense, but I always had to keep reading on into the next chapter because I just had to know what Holden would do next.<BR> Possibly another reason I think so highly of Salingers novel is because I closely relate myself to Holden.  I am a sixteen-year-old kid who is facing adolescence, and I share some of the same characteristics as Holden.  When I decided to read a classic, I thought it would bore me to death, but I realized that fifty years ago teens talked and acted much like they do today.  <BR> Through Salingers brilliant ideas, relating characterization, and humor, I was drawn into the fact that Catcher in the Rye is one of the best novels I have read.

He sees the world as many &quot;phonies&quot;.  He is not disciplined at all and is not well educated.  He has been to several private schools, although he manages to be kicked out of all of them.  So he has had the chance to be well educated he never applies himself though.  He has no drive in him that I see.  He has a poor outlook on everything wrong and write in the world.  If this type of person is the type the author tried to portray in the novel, he did a very nice job.  It would be interesting to read some of his other novels to compare them.  I hope not all the main characters in his novels are that negative.  Do not get me wrong the book was good as a whole.  The mood and negativity of Holden added to the quality of the book.  That is more than likely what the author was trying to create in his writing.  It educated the reader a little about life in school and for a young adult.  How it might be a little rough at times and there are decisions that must be made on the way.  I hope that some young adults can learn that school is important and a necessity of life.  I took that one thing away from this book plus a few others.  Parents might learn something as well.  They can learn to be a little more understanding of their children at times.

Many people dislike simply for that, but I, on the other hand, have reason for it. Sure, I was required to read this for my freshman language arts class, so, like most books one is forced to read, it's expected that the student will dislike it. Once again, not my reason. Unlike so many people around my age, I happen to like reading, and over this past year, this is the first book I have hated out of the sixty or so I read. I'm sure the die-hard fans of this book are going to go completely insane after just simply reading the title of my review, but this is just one person's opinion. I suggest that you read plenty more, because if you don't hate this book, you'll love it.<br />Perhaps the worst part of the book would be the main character Holden. Holden is a very angry, bitter, and mentally unstable sixteen-year-old who can find something annoying or depressing in the most simple of things. It seemed to go on forever, his constant whining about the \\""phonies,\\"" or more elaborately put, show-offs and exhibitionists who act like completely different people than they really are. He labels pretty much everyone phony for some reason, and he makes it clear from the first page of his hate of them. The story is told from first person view, hence the complaining. Holden seemed to have an image set in his mind of how other people should be, and should act. In this I'm sure many people can identify with him in some way or another, as so many people have a disrespect for certain types of people. I consider that perfectly acceptable, but the way that Holden constantly went on and on about the phonies and fools who he just couldn't stand just inevitably got on my nerves by the middle of the book.<br />As I said, The Catcher in the Rye is told in first person view. To make the complaining worse, you add on Holden talking all the time. He seems to like to explain things a bit too thoroughly, and, while he gets the point across, he also manages to get off subject so much it's just unbelievable. I read one paragraph which was, I think, over three pages long, and I know that Holden must have changed subject at least five times over the course of it. This is no exaggeration. I know that the most constant complaint in my class was his rambling. It's as if Holden couldn't keep his mind on one thing for more than a few seconds. That certainly wasn't helped when Holden would start talking about phonies. I'm sure that certainly hurt the book quite a bit.<br />Really, I can't think of anything about the book which I enjoyed, other than the first few chapters when I was not yet annoyed be Holden's view of almost all other people. In my opinion, Holden ruined the book completely. I'm not saying that this is not well written literature, but it's just a book I hate. It certainly is realistically written, and the characters are well thought out and realistic, but as I said, you either love it or hate it. I happen to hate it. Many happen to like it. Read some other reviews, otherwise you will just hear the view of one person, when perhaps The Catcher in the Rye may deserve more praise.<br />A bit of feedback please! Helpful or not?",2002-12-31
US,52876117,R545OSZSBNCRA,0316769487,862964341,The Catcher in the Rye,Books,2,4,9,N,N,"An Extremely Overrated ""Classic""","The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger is considered to be a modern classic, a piece of literature that's value won't fade with time.  It is set in the late forties or early fifties and is about a seventeen-year-old boy named Holden Caulfield and the 48 or so hours of his life after he is kicked out of yet another high school for flunking most of his classes.  The theme of the book is seeing the world through a very original, angsty character's eyes and understanding what the world means to someone whose life is slowly falling apart.<br />The sad reality is that The Catcher in the Rye is probably one of the most overrated books of all time.  The story aside, the style and form of the writing itself is so simplistic and vulgar that it is downright offensive to read.  The narrative is the first-person journal of the main character who happens to be a pretty bad writer, which makes the reading of the book far from enjoyable.  The vast majority of the sentences are short and choppy; the sentence structure never varies, creating a horribly boring read.  If one pulled out the unnecessary cuss words from the narrative, the book could quite possibly be 20 pages shorter.  The protagonist tends to repeat himself several times and continually tries to convince the reader that what he's saying is true.  Salinger would probably defend his work by saying that the narrative was keeping Holden in character.  I retort that if keeping the narrator in character means insulting the readers' intelligence, then perhaps making the character a better writer is in order.  (On a side note, Holden's best subject in school is English.  Go figure.)<br />The description in the story is also very lacking.  Description in the first-person is a harder task than in third-person writing, but it's not impossible.  Salinger has our character walking through high schools and 50's New York streets, in apartments and bars galore, but the reader is never immersed into the environment.  Instead of facing the challenge of description in the first person, it's as though Salinger chooses to ignore it entirely.  And when there is description, it is blunt and to the point; there is no embellishment that might bring the world to life.<br />Aside from the writing itself, the plot is the worst aspect of this book.  The problem is that there is none.  We are thrown into an arbitrary spot in this boy's life and we follow him aimlessly around New York for two days.  Nothing actually happens.  There is no flow of events, there is no building climax, and there is no resolution.  We simply follow Holden Caulfield around for a while and then we stop.  If readers of this book are expecting a story, they will be sorely disappointed.<br />The only good aspect of this story is the characterization.  Holden Caulfield is the original angsty teenager.  That is nothing original in this day and age, but Catcher has been credited as the first story to really bring that aspect of adolescence to light.  And, despite his now stereotypical personality, he still manages to be a very original character.  Many teens may be angry at the world, but Holden manages to be a very sympathetic person at the same time.  Sadly, that is as deep as the character gets.  He either hates, pities, or both pities and hates everyone he encounters, excepting his little sister alone.  What's worse is that there is little to no character development.  The Holden Caulfield of the first chapter is the exact same Holden Caulfield of the last chapter except that he has decided to write the journal that comprises the book.  Holden's little sister, Phoebe, is just about the one and only delight of this story.  Her character is the deepest of the secondary characters, and she's one of those personalities that makes simply reading about her a joy.  Without her, there would be no redeeming factor to this book at all.<br />So, if Catcher is such a bad read, what made it a modern classic?  The answer can be found on page 189 of the Little, Brown Books paperback edition.  The speaker is one of Holden's old teachers from an earlier school who is trying to help him decide to straighten his life up.<br />\\""Many, many men have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now.  Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles.  You'll learn from them--if you want to.  Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you.  It's a beautiful reciprocal arrangment.  And it isn't education.  It's history.

Salinger proves to be a novel about nothing more than the depressed misadventures of flunkout, Holden Caulfield.  Holden through out the entire novel complains about nothing more than the whole world and how everything in it is phony.  Listening to his on-going bouts with depression is not the most enjoyable thing to  read.<BR>   Holden's views of the world and the people living in it are a little less thoughtful than the average description.  Holden just flat out judges people on something as simple as the way someone carries themself in their profession.  He comments on the piano player Ernie, who is so good, that if he were to talk to he wwouldn't give you the time of day!  This is totally wrong and extremly childish of Holden to consider someone phony if they are a master at their profession. Holden does comment himself as being childish, (pg.9) so these type of views,although prejudice, should be expected. Defining prejudice in the case of Holden would be thathe is obviouslly jealous of those who can be considered phony.  If being phony means being someone who has made a living for themself and has achevied what most people would consider sucsess, all Americans, or at least mostAmericans, would want to be phony!  The list of phonies goes on and on.  Ernie, Mrs. Morrow, Stradlater, the boys at Pencey and the boys at Holden's other schools.  It seems that the only people who are not phonies are, Phoebe, Holden's sister, Allie, Holden's dead brother and Holden himself. <BR>   Holden through out the novel struggles with his depression, this prehaps the largest conflict of the book.  All other disputes seem to disappear compared to Holden's on going battle with himself.  <BR>   Salinger uses flashback like descriptions of Holden's brother, Allie,who died of cancer.  Salinger used memories of the baseball glove to give us some insight into what exactly is going on in Holden's head.  Maybe, just maybe, the reader can make some connectionbetween Holden's past and his depressed present state.  <BR>   The theme is simply this; nothing can destroy your life faster than you can.  If you can not come to terms with your own struggles, no other problems can be resolved.<BR>   A catcher can not catch without the glove. Allie's glove is one of the things that Holden remembers best about Allie.  Allie died as a young child.  The child singing on the street is a direct connection for Holden.  The field symbolizes life, when a field runs of out to a cliff, the vegatation slowly dies out, once the rye is completly gone the only place to go is off the cliff.  Falling off the cliff, in Holden's mind, is death. Holden feels if he can catch the children, he can save someone from the pain that he felt at his brother's death.  Although he may not relize it, he is saving more than the cchildren, by commiting himself to others, he is saving himself.<BR>  I think if you are looking for a book that's underlying message is something you must figure out yourself, this one is for you.

As an adolescent, this book was sometimes like a best friend, a comfort and reassurance that I was not alone in my &quot;outsider&quot; view of the world. The narrator - Holden Caulfield - is a classic &quot;outsider&quot; in the Colin Wilson sense of the word - an individual who is on the fringes of society, unsure of his place and unable to tolerate what most people regard as regular social discourse. Everything reeks of phoniness to Holden, and most of the characters he encounters in his New York sojourn do have pretensions that would make those of us who are more cynical cringe. Yet he remains a uniquely likeable character, as we can see that he has the capacity to love, and he sees a special innocence in children which is best portrayed through his relationship with his little sister Phoebe. There is no real plot to this book, it is strictly the observations of society through the eyes of one everyman who may or may not resonate with the reader. What astonishes me is how this book can make people feel connected to something rather than more disconnected. Perhaps that is it's greatest achievement - it leaves the reader with a sense that they are not alone in their feeling of disenfranchisement with contemporary society. It is also screamingly funny at times, and occasionally quite sad. It certainly isn't for everyone, but those who love this book will probably always have a special place for it in their hearts.",2002-12-04

Salinger, demonstrates the eremitic, yet everyday-life of a teenager named Holden Caufield by exhibiting the agony he experiences constantly but eventually displaying there is more to him than one perceives. Holden gets kicked out of Pencey Highschool--one of the many schools he's been kicked out of already- and on his way to his dorm, he decides to visit one of his acquaintances when \\""all of a sudden,\\"" he says, \\""I changed my mind.  All of a sudden, I decided what I'd really do, I'd get the hell out of Pencey-right that same night and all... I just didn't want to hang around any more.  It made me too sad and lonesome\\"" (p. 51).  Depressed of his life, he depreciates the many failures and downfalls that he has been reproved of and refuses to atone for his heedlessness and imprudence.  Holden neglectfully ignores better opportunities in addition to neglecting his problems and usual life-obstacles by manifesting his hate of the world and his aimless futile of his life.  Negligent of insolence, his ten-year-old sister, Pheobe, even persists he doesn't \\""like anything that's happening\\"" which \\""made [Holden] even more depressed when she said that\\"" (p. 169).  Pheobe finds the right words to portray Holden's personality and most likely the main reason why Holden is insecure and unhappy--because there's nothing he takes the time to enjoy.  Holden, however, listens to Pheobe and although he doubts her, he cares about what she says thus portraying the affectionate side of him and conveying his character as a means of possible hope within himself.  Although incredulous, despite the many hardships Holden encounters, the author is trying to depict the misery of a teenager that he or she goes through is something that many misunderstand and that there's always something deeper then many descry it as. <br />---<br />.:My Opinion:.<br />I was astonished at Holden's attitude and use of words, but of course characteristics such as these are necessary to portray the type of character and set the mood.  Constantly, however, Holden always seemed to get side tracked telling a story then suddenly jumping to something completely irrelevant.  Most likely, most novels start out slow-however! I found this book slow until the very end.  I can see why this book is considered a classic because its value to society it confers, yet I never found any excitement in reading it.  <br />This book in my opinion isn't exactly a story, but more of a reality check.  Honestly, when I finished reading the book, all I could say is, \\""Okaaay?\\""  I was definitely going to rate this book a \\""1\\"" until I read other reviews and realized how unperceptive I was being.  I contemplated about what the message was and what kind of character Holden represents in society today.  I considered pensively about the irrelevant details and the simple, constant use of certain words, and finally came to a conclusion that everytime he talked to someone they wouldn't listen to him.  Then I realized that was exactly what I was doing-I didn't want to hear his \\""boring\\"" stories that had nothing to do with anything! The whole time I was thinking, \\""What is he so depressed about?!\\"" but I realized in the end that that's why Pheobe made him so happy-- she listened to him.  <br />So I changed my view about things and ruminated that Salinger's message of a teenager's deeper feelings is exactly what this book is.  The novel, \\""The Catcher in the Rye,\\"" is a teenager of books with deeper meaning, just like Holden.<br />Strange, huh? How we judge something or someONE before we actually stop and take a deeper look?<br />\\""Everyone sees who you seem to be, few understand who you really are.\\"" --Machiavelli",2002-12-04

Having been one of the few people amongst my friends to not have read 'The Catcher in the Rye', I decided to finally pick it up and give it a try.  I knew nothing about the book's premise or character(s).  Having gone into the experience blind, I feel that I came away with more than I may have otherwise.<br />On the outside, Salinger provides a story way ahead of its time.  He achieves this by using amazingly modern prose in a book half a century old.  What I thought were late-20th, early-21st century concepts are mentioned in varying degrees of detail, while others are merely implied.  Nevertheless, I was taken aback by the coarseness and realness of Salinger's words.  They made the Holden Caufield character that much more tangibly real and relatable.  <br />It also seems that Salinger was intent on making a social statement with this book.  My interpretation of it is quite different than other readers, but that is this book's greatest quality--it's packed with symbolism in so many places and in so many ways that every reader can guarantee herself a unique, one-of-a-kind experience.  While the story seemed a bit too unimportant at times, by the end, Salinger leaves you with a growing sense of reflection and intrigue as to what Holden is really about, and what the author was really trying to say through his famous disgruntled teenager.<br />I would definitely recommend this book to just about anyone; should you choose to make its story a personal mantra or write a dissertation on its implied social views, you'll enjoy the book all the same.

I am a fifteen-year-old girl and I can really relate to the character of Holden Caulfield. He's headed toward a world that he doesn't want to live in; a world that he sees as phony and dangerous. He doesn't feel like he belongs. I found his comments to be funny and his flow-of-consciousness writing to be realistic. Some people see the constant cursing as bad writing, but it's not. It's realistic. That's the kind of person Holden is. <BR>Many people find this book pointless and boring. What many don't understand is that this is a character-driven book, not a plot-driven one. And also, things are not as they seem. Because Holden is narrating, it's hard not to simply accept everything he says. But then we meet Phoebe, and Mr. Antolini, who point out where Holden could be wrong. It can be hard for the reader to understand that though, because Holden doesn't think he is wrong. <BR>While there *are* bad and phony people in the world, Holden is wrongfully blaming everything on other people. He distances himself from everyone--it's sort of like a case of Social Anxiety Disorder, in a way. But he never comes out and says that. The reader has a responsiblity to analyze Holden, because he does not explain everything to them--he can't. Although he does go into great detail about certain events, items, and other people, he can't explain much about *himself*, and that makes it interesting. But it's a wonderful read, because it delves into the thoughts of a sweet, screwed-up kid who just doesn't understand how to interact with people. <BR>I think that if you were to read up on the subtle hints and character analyses in this book, you will find that it's much deeper than it appears during the re-read.",2002-10-05

One negative reviewer said just read the Cliff Notes version to spare the time. If you really want to find the true emotion in the book, READ IT. Sure, the protagonist, Holden Caufield is basically a messed up, immature person who has problems with life but if he didn't exist, there would have been no story. The basic summary is about a problematic 16 year old who hasn't lost his virginity and complains and questions things about life as he is kicked out from his fourth boarding school and tries to put things together by going to New York, his hometown. The book is well written even though he uses a lot of cuss words. It tells a message on his views on the adult world thinking that school is nothing but an ongoing path just to get a job and making money. Holden just doesn't want to accept the adult life and doesn't want to grow up and be part of society. And Holden explains this through his bad experiences in life. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read about the rebel trying to escape from society but if you just seem to hate that and don't want to read about some guy who complains a lot, then this book is probably not for you. Not the best book I've read, but still worth the time if you're interested. It is J.D. Salinger's best work and if you want to read more of his works, read the short story &quot;A Perfect Day for Bananafish&quot;.

Perhaps it seemed new and innovative when it first came out, but now it's so overhyped it's disgusting.<br />One of my biggest problems with the book is there is no background story - Holden was shipped off to a private school and asked not to return, apparently not the first school he was eased out of - but there's no reason given. Was he destructive? Did he threaten the other students? Or was he merely bored and didn't do schoolwork? Apparently he wasn't that troubled that they booted him out, the school intended to allow him to stay until the end of the semester. I get the impression the reason's a bit more than slacking off of the schoolwork, but it's never given. And in this age after Columbine, it's difficult to figure out what he could have done to be booted from school.<br />The other problem I have is it's all from Holden's point of view - you don't know if he is behaving as crazy as he sounds or he's terribly self-conscious or exactly what is going on within him and around him. There's no description of how the outside world views him, really, just brief spots where others interact with him. He seems utterly miserable and depressed, but I'm never sure if it's the fact he's been booted from another school or he's clinically depressed and needs some sort of intervention.<br />Read the book - if that's your choice or assignment - but know that if you don't think it's a wonderful piece of literature, you're not alone.

First published nearly half a century ago, it's story is still relevant to every young generation that has followed since. Holden's anti-heroic personality manifests itself in popular film and literature even today [and often]. On the surface the story is simply about a clever, but volatile, teenager that can't seem to stay sane in his own skin; a coming of age story.

Therein lies the mystery of literature -- I suppose if I ever harbored thoughts similar to Holden's, I would be embracing this much-loved anti-hero.<br />It was not until the final chapter that I found myself feeling sorry for Holden. Come to think of it, he does not even fit the official definition of an anti-hero. An anti-hero tries, but fails. He is defeated by the forces of nature (which includes human nature, in my book). His downfall is sometimes the undoing of an unsuspecting individual. Perhaps the closest Salinger comes to defining the anti-hero in his piece de resistance are the early references to Thomas Hardy's The Return Of The Native. Sadly, Holden does not even come close to the tragic heroes that are Clym Yeobright and Eustacia Vye.<br />But in a strange and probably effective way, that disconnect sums up the person of Holden Caulfield. He is an empty shell of a boy, as compared to his peers, and the irony of it all is -- for all that Salinger tries to convince us being \\""true\\"" is about, you realize that truth is manifest as a human being that amounts to nothing, one who has been defeated by his own principles and beliefs.<br />Prejudices against Holden Caulfield aside, there is no denying that the writing is sharp, engaging, and brilliant... it does unlock the part of me that identified with Holden at some point in my life. I don't like this book because of its irrelevance to me, now, but I applaud Mr. Salinger for putting into words what every 16-year-old has always found it hard to say aloud, especially to adults.

He probably gets along better with kids because they never tell him he is too young to do something.  The book was not all bad though, in fact the only part of the book i wasn't too fond of was Holden's character.  He said things over and over and over.  There were glimpses of humor on his part but i don't know why everyone in the book put up with him.

It was the one that was closest to my life also known as reality. As you read this book, it seems as if Holden's always digressing into some other insane subjects, but isn't that how people really think? Also, all of Holden's pessimistic views accord with how people really feels. Mankind seems to always have this dark view of things even though happiness is layed right in front of their eyes. Well, I'm digressing again. Anyways, this book was a book that was certainly one of the better ones, and was a book that never stopped your emotions from rising. <br />Based on what I'm reading on the review board, and what other poeple I know said about this book, one similarity seems to arise from all the reviewers, complaints about the ending and the \\""message\\"" behind the book.

Who hasn't been disgusted with his present situation at one time or another, with the same drab setting and boring people, the same tedious authority figures, the seemingly inescapable occupational path laid out in front of him?  Caufield is our phony-exposing id, getting kicked out of school, running away from convention, and telling anyone in his path exactly like it is.  I, for one, feel like there's as many frauds around now as there were in Caufield's world (New York's boarding school establishment in the 1950's)- just pick up any paper- and would love to at times similarly pack up and escape them all.<br />Caufield's heart is in the right place throughout this tale of, essentially, a young man's mild descent into madness (I say mild because it is accompanied by none of the gun-wielding trauma we have come to associate with disillusionment among  today's post-Columbine teens).  He says goodbye to a professor at the boarding school he's tossed from; he defends an old girlfriend's honor from his cad roommate; he fondly and regretfully reminisces about his dead younger brother; and he dotes on his sister Phoebe throughout, even entering his parents' house under the cover of darkness (and in a drunken stupor) to check in on her while she slept.  When he visits her at school and takes her to the park the next day, right at the brink of his collapse and threatening to leave his environment forever, the scene is as touching as it is suspenseful.<br />I would like to have seen more resolution from this story, such as his making contact with his unrequited love, who was never mentioned after Caufield fought his roommate for dating her.  However, I recognize Catcher is more about one errant weekend- albeit a very revealing one- than it is Caufield's life's story.

I was never forced to read it in high school and now that I am in college and have started reading on my own, I decided to check out this classic work.<br />Holden, going through what can be considered normal teen emotions, appears to have a real chip on his shoulder. After being kicked out of yet another school, Holden becomes depressed. Wandering around New York until it is safe to go home, he is left to wallow in obscurity. The only people or things he cares deeply for is his little sister, Phoebe, and his dead brother, Allie. Holden's relationship with Phoebe, my favorite aspect of the book, is the only thing managing to keep him sane. Borrowing a phrase that Holden likes to use, Phoebe really &quot;knocked him out.&quot; The other characters, such as fellow Pency students Ackley and Stadtler, have limited roles and only further add to Holden's disillusionment.<br />From the beginning of the book it easy to identify with Holden, even though his view of the world is almost exclusively negative. Holden confides in you and it feels very easy to confide in him. At first the ending seemed empty, as it if was lacking a denouement. However, if you read between the lines, the ending is very fitting. This is the theme throughout the rest of the book too--it is an average story when taken at face value but further inspection reveals greatness.<br /><br />I did enjoy reading this book.

I had moderate optomism about the book. The Catcher in the Rye is about the misadventures of a young teen named Holden, who just go kicked out of his forth private school. He goes from one location to another, from school to NYC, to a mental hospital where he tells this story. Many people respect and appreciate this book and the work of the skilled author, J.D. Salinger, but they also say that you either love the book or hate the book. As much as I can respect this book, I have to say I can't stand the story.<br />Salinger does write the book in a style that I like. The scenes and descriptions described in the book are so vivid and realistic that I can easily picture everything in my head, detail to detail. The characters that Holden encounters have the same detail put into them as the settings and situations, from their looks, to attitude and demeanor, to even their bad habits.<br />However, as good as the detail is in the books, the story itself is the root of any good novel. This is where this book's quality plummets badly. First off, this novel is lacking a large element that puts a good book together: plot. I read the book, beginning to end, and there is none. There is not a single thing that would show that the story has a plot or a task at hand. Most would say that the task for Holden is to get home after being kicked out of school, but a large chunk of this book is all side treks, diverting away from the main situation at hand, resulting in a novel about nothing. This really makes the book very boring and pointless.<br />The second element to a good book is a good protagonist, or main character. The main character in this book, Holden, is a kind of protagonist that many just don't like. He is your stereotypical rich snob, coming from a wealthy family who can afford to send him from one school to another. He also has a snotty, pessimistic attitude about life, other people, and himself. To all the people around him, they're all \\""phony\\"" and he's better than them, but when he thinks about himself, he degrades himself also. Very hypocritical if you ask me, but he admits that in the book. He also gets very depressed easily, so you don't really see a happy side to this person, or any side that would say he's motivated to do something, or anything for that matter. He just brags about his sister, drinks, treats women poorly, and spends a ton of money, all while under heavy depression. Holden is the kind of person you either feel sorry for, or just want to smack in the face. Both feelings are not feelings a reader should have about the protagonist.<br />The overall mood of this book is the final element that makes me want to put the book down after a few pages. Holden's attitude gets him into lots of trouble and lots of bad situations. From one encounter to another, it all ends in sadness and depression. Imagine having to read one depressing story to another, in perfect detail. The only good thing I can say about the mood is that the author writes it very well. However, when I read this book, I always had to stop myself from getting myself depressed after reading all of Holden's misadventures.<br />To summarize, imagine sitting in front of a rich pessimist and hearing him ramble on and on and on about everything. There would be no point, no happiness, and no end. Imagine having to hear the rambler for a grade. Can't stand it? Neither could I. Sorry Mr. Salinger, but please put your writing skill to better use. As much as I respect the quality work of this author, I couldn't stand reading this book....",2002-05-30

Perhaps the teenage years of one's life are the most lonely that one goes through....and to find someone else who identifies with you at that point in time seems ineffable....even today i enjoy reading this book as i can now at this age understand the finer tones and nuances that were missed at a younger age....i recommend this book highly....",2002-05-24

His complicated situation is caused by his continuing search for a true meaning or quality of life.  Holden is tired of the \\""phonies\\"" that surround and have daily contact with him.  He looses interest in school and quickly falls into trouble.  Failing to maintain his grades in private school force him to be dropped from the program entirely.  Holden then commences his search for his true self and wanders the streets of New York while battling his growing depression.  He meets new people and runs into past acquaintances that simply confuse him even deeper rather than helping him sort out his emotions.  At one point, Holden tries to just go home but cannot bear his mother's disapproval and his father's constant lecturing.  Instead, Holden goes to the one person who seems to be able to clear his mind of troubles, his sister Phoebe.  Holden's depression is temporarily lifted during a conversation with Phoebe, but quickly returns and forces him to move on.  Holden experiences both mental and physical trauma and realizes that he must find professional help soon, which is exactly what he ends up doing.<BR>     Holden Caulfield is my favorite character.  He represents what most teenagers go through at one point or another.  I can very much relate to him.  I have also run into the \\""phony\\"" people that Holden did.  \\""Phony\\"" people are those who appear to be one thing when they are clearly another.  These \\""phonies\\"" portray false images to gain acceptance in the crowd.  These false people end up hurting themselves and sometimes the ones surrounding them.  I understand Holden's disgust towards these false people and appearances.<BR>     I like this book very much.  My favorite part is when Holden returns to his hotel room after a night of heavy drinking and socializing.  He meets Maurice the bellboy on his way up on the elevator.  Maurice is secretly an amateurpimp.  He agrees to send a girl up to Holden's room in a few minutes.  What I like about this part of the book is the whole action and dialogue coming from Holden.  He really acts like a drunken 16-year-old.  When the girl finally arrives, she has a fight with Holden over her price.  Maurice ends up having to come up to the room and punch the lights out of Holden.  I think it is a very well developed story with an excellent plot and great characters.<BR>     I honestly recommend this book to every one.  It will give readers a chance to look inside the developing mind of a 16-year-old boy and see what it goes through.  Parents and teenagers alike will enjoy this book very much.",2002-05-21

That was forty years ago. Ever since, I have always had a copy of Salinger's novel in my library. I think about it every so often.<br />          The difference between this book and other books is the immediacy of the writing. From the famous first sentence,  Holden Caulfield  talks to you as a real confidant. You are immediately his best friend.  He confidies his private thoughts to you without any hesitation as to your relationship to him.  There is an unspoken conclusion that he needs you to talk to. And he needs you now.<br />           David Copperfield, which opens with that other famous first sentence, addresses you formally. His verbs are properly conjugated. and his diction is polished. David does not get close to you. He tells you his story from the podium.<br />             Holden sits right next to you, leans against you, and talks to you.  He language is informal and his diction is not so great. You don't care. Suddenly, someone is confiding in you. You want to hear him out.<br />            That is why the novel works. Holden immediately accepts you, blemishes and all, as his best friend. He tells you his story even though he just met you. He is a stranger confiding in you.<br />              Thomas Hardy tells a good story. He converses plainly and directly to the reader. Dickens addresses the reader. Salinger confides in the reader.

That's OK as far as it goes, but when assassins of popular cultural icons, like John Lennon's killer, seek to relate their motives for evil actions by referring to this book, what does that mean?<br />It means this book can also function as a magnet for the unhinged, who wish to be free by reinventing themselves.<br />The whole catching image articulated by irresponsible young Holden is hard to understand, too, and who really knows what a field of rye looks like anyway?  Why the cliff image?  Could it be that being caught in a big whopping lie is like suddenly falling over a cliff?  No way to repair it?  Just time for sudden, dramatic consequences?<br />Salinger is a riveting personality, and also a great anti-hero, exemplified by his resolution to never talk to a single critic about this book, with the sole exception of a girl writing for her high school newspaper.  Maybe he was tired of over-serious, over-credentialed literati types, who are too late and too ill-equipped to redeem their heavy, boring lives from their earlier failure to embrace a little more spontaneity, a little more fun, a little more high school newspaper derring-do.  <br />Whatever it is, it's still fun to read.

Reading Catcher in the Rye felt like bathing in a toxic waste plant. <br />T.S. Elliot said, April is the cruelest month of the year because the sun reveals some things wed rather not see. Likewise, Salingers work conjures up the darkest memories of adolescencememories Id ceremoniously burned (along with my acid wash jeans and Debbie Gibson cassettes) years ago. <br />Of course, I must recognize that my response is perhaps reflective of my aged removal from young adulthood. As an educator, it is imperitive that I am tuned in to what makes my students tick. If theres one redeeming element of the book, it is that I was reminded of what a potential time bomb is the teenage brain. Regardless, Im sure that point could have been made without harping on the most banal aspects of adolescent existence.<br />Having recently observed the teaching of Catcher in the Rye in a high school classroom, I experienced first hand students reactions of apathy and distaste for the book. Student editorials discussed Holdens narrow character development. One student made the point that if Caulfield is a character adults use to peer into the adolescent mind, they are largely misled. The common consensus among the students held that Holden is not the quintessential teenager.<br />So I think it unfortunate that students suffer through the Catcher experience. While I cannot speak for everyone, the specific classes I observed were most turned off by Holdens language, poor decision making, and overall depression. Many explained that Holden is not a character they would like to strive to be like. Rather, he is merely someone to feel sorry for. And who wants to read an entire book where the primary emotion invoked is pity? <br />I will acknowledge that there are certain themes in Catcher that are universal. Themes include loss of innocence, rebellion from society, mental instability, death, immaturity in sexual relationships, and resentment towards parents. While these are issues most any teenager can relate to, presentation is of the essence. Unfortunately, based on my HS classroom observations, Salingers writing style and characters have little to offer todays breed of students.<br />I wonder if my reaction to the book would be different were I ten years younger. But as for now, I already know how bad raw sewage reeks, so why expose myself to such noxious fumes page after page? The masochists can have their Catcher.

He's like the weirdo in high school you felt sorry for but made fun of anyway.  I have absolutely no sympathy for Holden.

As a native New Yorker, I can identify with the feeling of familiar sites like Broadway, Fifth Avenue, and Central Park.  I couldn't stand Holden's constant cynicism, and at Chapter 17, I myself wanted to punch his lights out. But in Chapter 22 I think I finally realized what he was looking for deep down inside--a reason to live, and the courage to live it.  He expresses a desire to rescue people, but he's projecting--he's the one that needs rescue.  I was actually starting to like the poor jerk.

Every time I return to it, I always seem to find something more in it. Structurally, it is challenging. Although the vocabulary is simple, the repetition of symbolic imagery makes this a complex read on one level. Holden's fascination with ducks, museums, and even bathrooms is intriguing. But on a personal level, Holden gives voice to all the things that we once thought but found too dificult to face square on. For example, what happens to our loved ones when they die? What is the meaning of life or the point to living? I think part of his answer is that the connections we have with those whom we love, although temporary, is what keeps us motivated to live. We want to see and be with those who mean the most to us. We want to see them happy and their happiness is what makes us happy. It took Holden a long time to figure this out. He contemplates suicide, escape, and even undergoes a mental breakdown. But the ending to me is positive in the sense that he foregoes his unrealistic desire for an ideal world, one without evil, and accepts the bad in order to enjoy the good this world offers.

He goes out of his way to explain the details of Holden's thoughts, but does not reach to extend to you the actual events surrounding the beginning and end of the book.<br />I find this to be a blessing now, though it was frustrating at the time. I frequently read online journals in which the events surrounding a particularly difficult patch in life are described in painful detail, but the thoughts of the person writing during those times are not adequately explained.

Holden is having a very difficult time trying to work through the death of his younger brother.  As adults, we can more predictably go through the stages of grief, but, as adolescents, we struggle through the death of loved ones in the context of our struggle for identity.  We not only try to find a career for ourselves but also prove our loyalty to our friends, imitate role models, solidify our sexual identity, and form ideologies.  Often, we say and do the opposite of what we mean because we find our feelings are so intense that we could not admit it straight out to the people around us and ourselves yet still be accepted.  Imagine how hard it would be to go through your teen years having lost a sibling.  Holden really does try to reach out to all the people he meets, but unfortunately, cannot express concretely what he is feeling; instead, he acts out with smoking, drinking, losing sleep, and searching for sexual escapades.  Eventually, he runs himself down physically and mentally.  Sadly, many adults do not see, or do not want to bear the responsibility, of getting teenagers to better express themselves and instead shame them.

But basically, this book just wasn't as great as everyone says. It's overrated to a degree, but I still found some merit in it. There wasn't much of a plot, and it wasn't very well-written, but it does have some rather interresting, likable charcters. Holden Caulfield himself, though, is just annoying. He complains about everything, gets depressed easily, repeats phrases like &quot;I really did&quot; and &quot;If you want to know the truth&quot; at least 50 times, and swears a lot. I'm 15 years old, and I can safely say that Caulfield is NOT the embodiment of teenage cynicism. I know some kids who are pretty dense, but most of us aren't nearly as obnoxiously pessimistic as Caulfield. Yet I mannaged to choke down the book in a few days. I only read it because I didn't have anything better to read. I will say a few good things, though. Salinger, via Caulfield, makes some rather interesting observations about the different kinds of people in life, sort of like a Horacian observer with a Juvenalian attitude. I will also say that I think the writing was DELIBERATELY bad, as Salinger was trying to make it sound like a real adolescent was actually writing his book, and he succeeded admirably in achieving that effect. But by and large, I didn't like the book and probably the only reason Salinger has been so reclusive for the past 50+ years is because he's ASHAMED of having written this mostly unenjoyable book.",2002-03-17

The catcher in the rye beautifully answers the question of what would happen if we decided to flunk out of our classes and try to make it on our own. His experiences in dating women, social affairs, and life in general reveal his character as being one of a loser in the eyes of the read. Such a loser that we, ourselves, have to question weither or not we embody at all. Do we, in fact, have problems with women, social functions, or school? For the vast majority of the population that is definitely the case thereby making the reader better able to relate to this boy who has moved in a downward spiral from some of our nation's top schools down to a mental ward reflecting upon the life that, at 17, had all gone terribly wrong. <BR>   The simple and collequal tone that Salinger gives to his protagonist gives a personal feeling reflecting almost a diary the likes of which far escape Anne Frank or any other such form. The less than eloquent style of writing and speaking that plagues Holden from progression and mirrors his lackluster work put into English provides empathy for a boy feeling as though the world has been coming down upon him as we all do during various points in our tumultious lives, and unlike us, Holden cracks under the pressure and gives into his most basic of sinful desires. While living in a motel he calls upon the services of a women of ill-repute, but backs out at the absolute last minute. When money runs low he has to go back to his sister to ask for some, money that would be taken from her piggy bank. Here a sister looks to help his brother during some of the lowest points of his teenage years. The love between the two shines through, and by the end of the novel the amount of love felt by the Caufield family toward their mentally scarred child comes between the lines. <BR>   After finishing the novel and before reading it again the idea of who would be to blame for the crime against this young man's well being and general mental health. The family did little to acomidate their son other than pay for him to go an expensive school on the east coast, yet lent no other real moral support per se. The ipso facto education provided by the universities did nothing to remedy the ills in academic and social areas during his stay on campus. Finally Holden's own inability to be mature enough to face to his final sense of failure by going back to his parents all let up to his eventual crack. <BR>   Salinger looks only to mock the american education system or the lack thereof in prestigious high schools such as Pencey Prep. There he recieved just the same education that he would have while being at a public school, while being provided with more of the types of people that could correctly balence his life. In effect giving him a better chance to steer clear of any problems that he may have had. In the end the paranoid feeling of \\""don't ever tell anybody anything. If you do, you start missing everybody\\"" presents Holden's despiration and sadness at his current state of affairs. Life is beautiful? Hardly, to Holden Caulfield life can be a horribly and competative place the likes of which we all struggle to survive in. What a great piece of literature.",2002-03-14

As a seventeen year old I am trying<BR>to find my place in the world, similar to what Holden is going through, in the novel. He is struggling with conformity and the phony adults around him.  <BR> The novel takes you into the life of Holden a troubled boy, growing up in the 1950s, who continuously gets kicked out of  schools he does not like. Holden is fighting the world of  phonies, that he tries to avoid as he rows up. Holden expresses himself with profanity, even though  it is not that bad, by today?s standards. The book also address issues of sexuality, insecurities, loneliness, and deception that comes with growing up. This novel discusses the moral, psychological, and intellectual development the main character.<BR> Holden also has relationship problems. As the novel progresses Holden begins to alienate himself from others, as a way of protecting himself. He wears a red hunting hat as a way to alienate himself from others and to show that he is better than everyone else. This causes him to push people who care most about him further out of his life. Holden needs to interact with, but  people usually confuse and disappoint him. He uses superiority as a type of self-protection, even though it is the cause of most of his pain. Holden never addresses his own emotions, nor does he attempt to interact with people. He tried to conceal his feelings from others, to prevent himself from being hurt, even though it caused him more pain, in the end. <BR> Holden also begins to close off his family and friends when he continuously fails out of school. Holden?s family is from a higher class, and sends him to private schools. Holden fails out of every school that he attends. His family becomes disappointed, and cuts him off emotionally.

Holden is too familiar.  We all know him.  What's gonna happen when somebody says 'Who cares?'<br /><br />Nevertheless The Catcher in the Rye is a wonderfully well-written and entertaining novel about a self-absorbed little punk who thinks he is--and probably is--smarter than everyone else.  But he's too young, too inexperienced, too unsure of himself to survive on his own.  He questions everything until nothing has an answer and increases his frustration until he's completely unable to do anything but dream, imagine he were something else--a protector.  He imagines he was somebody's savior.<br /><br />All subtextural religious nomenclature aside, this dream delves more deeply into the personality of the character, not some unattainable dream as the cynical and lacking in self-confidence narrator tries to tell you it is.  It is about someone frustrated because he is unable to change the world around him and a quest he already knows will end in failure of escaping himself and retransforming his life into something more profound.<br /><br />Yes, this is an extraordinarily powerful book, filled with the split cadences of lingo and slang to give you the feeling of having an actual conversation.<br /><br />And yet the problem of over-exposure cannot help but influence the outcome of experience.

He is kicked out of his school because he had failed in every subject except English. He has two older brothers... one of them died and the other is working in Hollywood. He's also got a younger sister who's his favourite. <br />As I said before Holden Caulfield is a 'close to crazy' guy. He is the narrator of the story. Mr. Salinger uses slangs and very informal writing to describe vividly what is going on and what are Holden's feelings. <br />What happens is that after Holden is kicked out of school, he goes to live in a hotel, and then goes to his teacher's house... but does not like either of them. In parts of the story he talks about his love life... how he gone out and made time with his girlfriends and all. <br />After all that stuff, Holden goes to his own home and talks to his favourite little sister Phoebe about his situation secretly... because he didn't want his parents to know that he's been kicked out. He decides to go away somewhere far away from his living place because he hates his present home. But Phoebe wants to go too... and for her sake Holden stays and that's the end of the book.<br />It is named 'The Catcher in The Rye' because of a very small reason inside the book. Once when Phoebe asks Holden what he wants to be when he grows up, this crazy guy answers that he wants to be at the edge of a cliff where all little girls are playing and he just wants to catch whoever is in the verge of falling off. He names this dumb occupation as the 'catcher in the rye'. <br />In all, this is a fabulous creation by J D Salinger.

This is the story about Holden, who has just been kicked out of his school, and spends a couple of nights and days in the great city of New York.  He goes through alot of things, that seem very credible, but the book, the way he describes what he's going through and his bitterly sarcastic outlook on life keep you entertained the whole way through.  You cant read a paragraph without reading at least 2 profanities, so if you cant handle it dont even bother.  And i cant believe it was written at least 50 years ago.  Most of the language and dialect he uses is just as modern as it is today. He can always find something about a character to make fun of or gripe about- and you'll find that within the first chapter.

As such, I am frequently at a loss to understand what the fuss is about. And it is perhaps for this reason that I still remain perplexed, nay flummoxed, by the cult status of this book and that of its repulsive protagonist, Holden Caulfield. <br />When I first endured this merciless literary thumbscrew, it was in the late 1970s, at the behest of a high school English teacher who wore clogs, wooden jewelry and ambulatory tents made of faded denim. She believed with almost anguished sincerity that her students would \\""connect\\"" with Holden, or find something \\""relevant\\"" in the book. I quickly came to a conclusion that a recent re-reading has done nothing to dispel:  Holden is a jackass. He's a spoiled prep school jerk who's so sickeningly self-involved that he has no clue that the people around him exist as anything other than background figures in the melodrama going on entirely in his own skull. He constantly refers to anything that doesn't meet with his schoolboy approval as \\""corny\\"" and labors under the delusion that he's the first person who ever noticed that the transition out of childhood is awkward and uncomfortable, or that it's just no picnic facing grief and loss. Listen, you pustular little spud, we all go through it, and it's about as cosmically significant as a crumpled wad of used Kleenex. Maybe half a century ago, this hog wallow of teen angst was something fresh. But if Salinger had some larger point to make about coming of age it has all but disappeared in the fetishization of adolescence that took off not too long afterward, and has clung to our culture ever since. And the excruciating way that Holden speaks-the kid sounds like his lines were written by some Monogram Pictures hack who specialized in gangster dialogue for Bowery Boys movies. All that's missing from Holden's self-consciously brittle patois is some edgypatter about the agony of acne or the distressing appearance of pubic hair. (\\""One crummy day these goddam phony red spots started sprouting all over my mug. Next day it was some corny cork-screwy hairs poppin' outta my BVDs. . . .\\"") On the plus side, this book did make me feel embarrassed to admit that I was 16, but I was one of only two people in the class who felt that way.

I never really took the time to see what it was about; I just pictured some guy out in a rye field, and the notion did not strike me as interesting.  I hope no one else has such an idea because this book is inherently honest, gripping, and interesting.  This is really a story of young angst , and it should really appeal to young people.  I actually see a lot of Holden Caulfield in myself, which is not necessarily a good thing.  However, I think there is some of Holden in almost everyone because Holden thinks and says the things that many people think (but perhaps will not admit).  This guy hates everything and everybody at some point.  One minute, he does something he doesn't want to do because he is afraid of looking foolish.  The next minute, he rushes headlong into a conversation full of tall tales and impassioned statements and requests he may or may not even mean.  Ironically, such maniacal conversations often reveal the deepest truths about himself.  Through it all, he questions why he does certain things, and repeatedly asserts that he is crazy.<br />What struck me most is the way seemingly small and arbitrary things depressed him.  The same thing happens to me, and such little things can actually be more depressing than major traumas.  These are feelings I have never been able to really explain, nor have I attempted to do so, yet Holden seems to express my own strange feelings clearly and eloquently.  He is just a confused young man, scarred by the death of his younger brother.  As he is away at school(s) so often, he is left quite lonely, yet he does not really know how to relate to other people.  The guy is to some degree a typical teenager, it seems to me, searching for a direction in life.  In his own mind, bothersome things happen to him all the time, and he is constantly disgusted by the action of phonies all around him.  Like him or not, Holden is no phony.<br />In a way, I'm not sure why this book is such a critical success.  It doesn't read like a traditional classic of literature, especially with the abundant cursing.  I consider this to be a painfully real and honest story, reflecting a very important viewpoint on life and society.  It pulls no punches, and it offers no apologies.  As a result, Holden Caulfield is one of the most \\""real\\"" fictional characters in all of literature.  While some readers may not like him, almost everyone can understand him, sympathize with him, and even learn from him.  This book is one to be read and read again.  I wish the story had gone on, that some of my questions had been answered.  Part of the point, though, seems to be that there really are no answers to be found.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone.  It should especially appeal to young people. It's relatively short, and it is realistic and gripping from start to finish.  While he is not a hero, Holden will become a soul mate of sorts to folks who are lonely and confused about their places in life.  If for no other reason, read it because it is a perpetual target of the banned books crowd.  There is a lot of cursing in these pages, but it is nothing extreme or unfamiliar to anyone out there who doesn't live in a convent.  I believe the cursing is actually necessary in terms of truly bringing Holden to life.  Concentrate on the story, not the words.  I have an old copy of this book, and on the cover are these words: \\""This unusual book may shock you, will make you laugh, and may break your heart--but you will never forget it.\\""  That pretty much says it all.r />In a way, I'm not sure why this book is such a critical success.

It wasn't that I didn't hear his message or empathize with him, but it was as if some very subtle but crucial connection was missing between us.  I guess the biggest reason I couldn't connect with Holden was because I am one of those children that he failed to catch and fell off the cliff.  Unfortunately, as life progresses, it is inevitable that we lose some of our innocence.    However, the degree of cynicism expressed by Holden was simply too much for this generally optimistic reader.  I probably would have appreciated this book much more if i had read it during my teenage angst years rather than my current stage of my life (one of balance and content). Yes, the world is full of &quot;phonies&quot;, but that doesn't mean the end to all innocence.

I thoroughly enjoyed the book while reading it. The story basically tells of a rebellious high school student named Holden Caulfield. He gets kicked out of school because of his horrible grades, but he hangs around New York instead of going home so that his mother can get the letter first and calm down before he gets home. He does a few crazy things while staying in New York, but he gets bored and finally decides to go home. The story itself is just talking about a high schoolers time in New York City, but the excellent part about the book is the way it is told.<br />Holden Caulfield is not your typical rebellious teenage high schooler; he is much more than that. The crazy things that he does are so weird that even rebellious teenagers nowadays don't even do them. The funny thing is that whatever crazy thing he does, it sounds normal to the reader. He tells it in a way that makes you agree with what he did. Everybody around him he considers a phony and then he describes why they are stupid. People don't understand him even though he actually is a very bright person, he just doesn't show it. Many things he says are actually worth considering in our world today.<br />The book is very funny and I finished it in just a couple of sittings, but if you are looking for an action packed book, this isn't one for you. Humor is a big key in this book and if you get the humor, you'll enjoy the book. This book is for people who think nobody understands them and that they are all alone in this world, because actually, as Holden learned, there are many people in this world that will actually listen to you if you give them the chance.",2002-01-09

During that time he lived in hotels in New York City. He got the money from his grandmother who never remembers his birth-date and gives him money.

Holden Caufield's lost weekend in New York seemed so risque and daring when I read it as a teenager.  I was most impressed with the language he used and wished that I could be as fast and loose with my language. Thirty years later does add some perspective and in view of language use today, The Catcher in the Rye seems awfully mild. Holden is obviously an imperfect and confused hero in search of finding his way in the adult world which he both covets and despises.  He is not well equipped for this quest, frequently failing to communicate is desires and feelings to the world around him. Caufield's pathetic attempts to communicate and involve himself with others leads him into further isolation.<br />Holden Caufield, the teenager created by J.D. Salinger is a strangely vulnerable young man at odds with the phonies of the earth.  After being expelled from one more prep school Caufield gathers his resources and spends a weekend in New York City before planning to return home.  Caufield is an amusing and obsessive youth who has an opinion about everything.  Holden a disorganized and directionless dweeb is true to his own values and morals.

During the course of the novel he copes with the necessity of maturity much like waves on the beach, rushing forward toward it and then running away from it, repeating the cycle over and over again.  Portions of the novel strike me as a bit uneven, but not so much so that one would consider it uneven in a broad sense.  The characters are well drawn, and the episodic story reasonably entertaining.  It is most likely to appeal to teenagers, young adults, and mature adults capable of laughing at their own past teenage hysteria.

So, of course I had to read it.<br />I neither loved it nor hated it.  Holden Caulfield was a memorable character, one that I would love to sit down and talk with, but a character does not make a great book.  Salinger created a wonderful character, a cynical yet compassionate, tough yet insecure teenage boy, an outsider in a &quot;phony&quot; world.<br />But then nothing happens.  We see a portrait of a kid full of angst, a character that most of us can relate with to some degree or another ... and Salinger just has him spout cynisms when he's not suddenly crying because he feels lonely.  He hatches crazy schemes about running away and then abandons them when he realizes that his kid sister needs him, and he needs her.  So he hangs around, then eventually goes out to stay with his older brother, who (were he not his brother) would probably be termed a phony by Holden.  And that's it.  He runs back to family when confronted with a lifetime of loneliness.  A realistic resolution, perhaps, but not really the stuff classics are made of.<br />At no time does Holden ever feel despair or hopelessness.  And why should he?  Despite the situations he is in, he's always in control and active.  While he's not loaded, he's got plenty of money.  He's got friends, even if most of them are border-line phonies.

The entire novel, in the form of a flashback and filled with many insignificant digressions, was really just an adolescent constantly rambling who is obvious a very emotionally and psychologically disturbed person. I do feel, however, that this book does have some purpose in that there are many teens on the brink of adulthood that need something like this to relate to, and not feel the isolation and alienation that Holden did.

Now, that isn't the most exciting plot in the world, and I know many have said that the plot is downright mundane.  It isn't the plot, however, that makes this book such a literary classic.  Through the eyes and words of Holden Caulfield, we are handed that rare glimpse of the heart of every rebellious teenager in the world.  There is not a page that goes by without Holden complaining about a phony teacher or a phony act, and by the fifth chapter, you start to realize that it isn't the world that is phony but rather the boy himself who sees it that way.  <BR>A look at the rebel in all of us is hidden deep inside the heart of Holden Caufield's narration, and within the 'goddamns' and the'phonies', we begin to realize the alienation that he feels is what each of us felt as we grew up in a world that moves a little too fast around us.  There is also an underlying humour in Holden's depictions of various scenes and conversations, as if he sees everything as a joke on himself.  An altogether thoroughly enjoyable book, something every teenager must read as we face the rushiing waters of life.",2001-12-09

Salinger","I've heard that Mark David Chapman, John Lennon's assassin, often used to read this book, and since John Lennon is one of my biggest idols, the book caught my interest - standing there in the school's cupboard. I thought it must be a very special novel. Every book that can be read more than once is out of the ordinary - and particularly if somebody special enough to kill John Lennon reads it. <BR> <BR>And very much indeed, The Catcher in Rye is a special book - one of the more special I've read. The story sets off by Holden Caulfield, the main character, telling you about him being kicked out of his fourth school - the fine and merited Pency Prep in Pennsylvania. <br />He takes farewell of some of his friends, travels to New York and spends a few days there. All this time he is thinking about whether he should go back to his parents or not. Everything in the book, except the quite many flashbacks, is happening within a few days. <br />Holden is a very special person. He doesn't really like anyone, except his little sister Phoebe. He is pessimistic and miss-trusts almost everyone he meets - which first annoyed me as reader, but after a while amused me because it's so well-written. The whole story consists of Holden telling you what he thinks about the people at Pency, the people at the other schools he went to and others he knows. The book also describes his way of thinking about ordinary things like &quot;where do all the ducks in Central Park go when the lagoon is frozen?&quot;.  <br />Holden is very anti-cliché in general, but he is especially against the adult society as such. He was not kicked out of the schools because he wasn't clever enough, but because he couldn't get along with the teachers, and he also couldn't cope with his parent's way of life. Perhaps it's because of his age (right between being a child and a grown-up) or because of his childhood, but he always seems to want to be rebel and revolt against society, without really knowing why. But he also wants to do something good to society and speaks well of people who do - for example some nuns that he meets. He has a dream, that some children are playing in a rye field up on a cliff, and he is the one saving (catching) them from falling off the cliff and into the ocean. <br />I absolutely think that The Catcher in the Rye is a great story. The ground-story is very banal with him being kicked out, going to New York, and thinking about whether he should go back home or not. One doesn't even get to know what happens when he gets back home, but even though, the story is utterly worth reading - it's the self-reflecting thoughts that Holden has and the ideas behind the book that count.",2001-12-03

This novel has created, in my experience, only two general responses: why is this a classic or wow.  The later response has always disturbed me as an adamant fan of the Catcher in the Rye.  However, I believe that this difference of opinion stems from the trouble some readers have empathizing with Holden.  This is not to say that due to this their opinions are invalid but instead, I believe, it points out something at the novel's core.  Holden is not some sort of man of the people or every-man; instead, he is something more narrow.  When someone cannot understand the perspective offered by Salinger, they often miss the point of the novel because they do not understand Holden, just like most of the people Holden himself meets throughout the story.  If these statements seem incredibly evasive, as to what Holden is, then I will be happy with my review.

Salinger is a good book. It's about a young boy, Holdon. He's only 16 years old. He tells us the story of his life. It's a funny book, sometimes one has to laugh very hard. Other times, it's a little bit boring. <br />Holden, the main character of the book, is kicked out of Pencey Prep, when the story begins. He tells about his life at Pencey. It's funny how he describes it: he's only sixteen years old, but sometimes you think he's an adult. He's very clever, but also very lazy, that's the reason why he's kicked out at Pencey. That part of the book I like  most. Certainly when he tells about his roommates, I had to laugh a lot. <br />The second part of the book, when he left Pencey, is more complicated. He is in New York all the time, and he doesn't dare to go home because his parents will get very angry. They don't know yet that he's kicked out at Pencey. He misses his little sister Phoebe most. He's spending much money. He goes to cheap hotels and he drinks a lot. He calls old friends and he thinks a lot about his childhood, about his dead brother Allie, about his life. He always uses the word `phony', for instance for people  he doesn't like. That word is cool, but he uses it too much, I think.  <br />After strolling in New York a few days, Holdon decides to go home. There he finds support by his little sister Phoebe. She's a very nice person, he likes her very much. In the end of the story, he goes home, but he doesn't want to tell what happened then. <br />It isn't an easy book to read, there's a lot of spoken American language in it, for instance `helluva' and  `watcha', I don't like that much. The vocabulary isn't easy, a few times I had to use a dictionary. The story is fascinating, but you spent a lot of time to read the whole book because there's much text on each page.<br />The story has a few strange turnings, for instance when he left the house of Mr Antolini. Some things I didn't understand, but the story in general, I understood. This isn't a boring story. In the beginning, I thought it was a stupid story, because I didn't understand a lot of words. But when you keep reading, you start to understand the words better because you are in the English mood. <br />At last, what I liked the most about this book, is the title, and how it's explained in the book.

It has layers to it that would be trivialized to try and explain, but for the sake of righting some of the unfair and horribly hollow reviews this novel has received, I'll try.  To begin with, the book is about the kind of teenager who is so deep and insightful it just hurts you to read his thoughts.  Anyone who has ever truly appreciated something seemingly inconsequential will connect with Holden Caulfield, because he is the epitome of that type of person: someone who hasn't got it all figured out, but wishes to, and who's got a shining soul as straight as a sword.  In the book, the reader is left to decide if Holden is actually crazy (or on his way there) or not.  Even a few *good* reviews of this book said he had a few screws loose.  In my own opinion, that is not the case.  Holden wasn't going crazy.  He just printed everything he thought.  Truth be told, if each of us typed down everything WE thought and got it published for others to scan, they'd think we were crazy too.  I don't even think Holden is a true pessimist.  Yes, he can be cynical, albeit often, and seems to have a &quot;half empty&quot; kind of few on life and things in general, but that is NOT the case.  In actuality, Holden is an idealist; he just covers it up with pessimism to protect himself.  Many &quot;cynicists&quot; do.  You see, Holden wants everything to be perfect and lovely so badly, it depresses him to see anything fall short of its full potential.  I won't go any more into it for fear of giving too much away (I probably already have), but the fact is that Holden's innermost, true self is everything all of us should try to be: a seeker of that which is solely good and right, one who can appreciate every little thing that manages to have no significance yet mean all the world, a champion of everything true, and an empath to the last.",2001-11-09

In the beginning you can laugh a lot with the personality of Holden Caulfield, but it starts to annoy a person very soon. Holden is a person who seems to hate everything and everybody, they all make him depressed. The comments he has about everybody are really funny in the first chapters, but after a while it made me feel depressed too, it really started to bore me. When I read a book  I think it's important that you can recognise yourself in the leading person of the story, or at least feel any sympathy with him or her. In this book I can't. Nothing really happens in the story, it are just a couple of days picked out of someone's life. And it aren't exactly the most exiting days, nothing interesting seems to happen in those days. Besides that Holden himself isn't really interesting too. In fact he's a very immoral boy, he lies and he drinks a lot. He also talks about the most uninteresting things. I'm not surprised when some people get sore at him for that, some of the things he wants to talk about are really boring.

Salinger )<br />My opinion about the book<br />Although I was not acustomed to the particular language used in this book, I found it rather pleasant to read. It is a simple book, with a simple storyline and easy characters. The main character is <BR>Holden Caulfield. Holden has been expelled from school and he is afraid of the reaction of his parents, so he leaves school and takes  a room in a hotel. He wants to give his parents the time to calm  before he faces them. (This is are the big lines of the story.)<BR>The book is written completely from Holden's perspective and you really get to know him after a wile. I like Holden Because you can't really tell if he has an inferiority complex or if he's just not intelligent enough to really understand what is going on around him. He has only one vision of the things and it doesn't come up to him that there could be other visions. (that's why sometimes he doesn't quite understand the reaction of certain people around him.- Why Sally likes &quot;The Lunts&quot; e.g.)<BR>The autor describes the other characters who interfer with Holden as closed chapters of Holden's life.  (e.g. Ackley, Stradlater, Sally,...)<BR>I like that. It is like sitting in a train and you look outside and you see everything going by without having seen it correctly when it was in front of you. The atmosphere described in the book is somewhat dark, melancholic and dreamy. It is the perfect setting for a guy like Holden. You sometimes can recognize yourself in him because he struggles with the same little troubles we have to deal with. This book is easy to comprehend also because of the simple way of thinking of the characters and their natural actions. The people in this book are very natural and that is good because everyone likes natural people in books (e.g. NOT James Bond).<BR>The book is not too thick and you don't get bored easily, but you have to follow the story. I like this book because it is different. It isthe story of the life of a person like there are so many other lifestories.  The simple formulations of the thoughts of Holden and the easy analysis of the characters would make it almost a book for children if the situation of those characters hadn't been so actual and recognisable for a more adult public. In fact, it is a simplification of a story that describes the failure of the life of a man who doesn't know what to expect from the future. <BR>I enjoyed this book and recommend it to others.<BR>This was my opinion about &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;.",2001-11-08

Salinger;  My opinion.<br />I have not much to say about this book, only that I didn't like it very much.<br />I think it's too long-winded and dull.  I really got bored of it.  The central figure, Holden Caulfield, talks to much about stupid details, and when he's telling us something, he begins to talk about something else in the middle of his story.  He's to busy with all the stupid toughts he has, and that really irritates me.  An other thing that bores me,  is that Holden uses some expletives like  &quot;boy&quot;, &quot;I mean ...&quot;, ...   <br />I also think that this book is ridiculous because, if you have read it and you will write the story down, it's about one page long without all those useless, stupid details.<br />I find the book also to &quot;difficult&quot;; the story is not difficult to understand, neither are the words that are used in the book, but it's not easy to follow when the narrator (who is Holden) changes the subject  constantly. I mean that he begins to talk about something, and when he uses someones name for example, he begins to describe this person immediatly.  When he has finished describing this person (for example two pages later), he begins again talking about the first subject.  At the time that he's there again, you have already forgotten the subject, and you have to read the whole passage again to understand what he's saying.<br />This is all I have to say about the book, I have no good words for it, and I am glad it's finished now.",2001-11-08

The events in this book really don't keep you reading it. Holden is getting more and more depressed, page by page, because of what he does and sees, and what happens around him, which is getting boring after a while. But I do understand that this book isn't about what Holden does or what happens to him, but about what goes trough his mind during this crazy period in his life. These thoughts are really interesting, in a way. By following his thoughts, we can learn what is important and precious to him, and what is not. <BR>Little by little, we learn Holden has a certain attitude to life, which clashes with the attitudes to life of others, or even with our society: for example, Holden dreams about being mute-deaf, becouse he wouldn't have to have stupid conversations.<BR>There are two thing I truly like in this book: first, there are the ducks in the lagoon, and second, there is the way Holden gets over his depression: Phoebe on the carousel.<BR>Maybe I can conclude that, after a while, when you start understanding Holden better, and when you start sympathisizing with him, and maybe even finding him likable, you also start understanding -and liking- the book itself.

Salinger<br />I have to admit I liked the story very much. I couldn't stop reading, so fluently it went. On the end it's a little bit heavy and it becomes a little bit boring. But only a little bit. I red it immediately when I got it, till chapter 15 and one or two weeks ago I finished it. I needed a few pages before I got in to it, because I didn't had a clue what the writer was talking about. I was guessing I would understand it while I was reading the story, but it wasn't so. I had a lot of questions when I finished it; and that is something I can't stand. <BR>Somewhere in the book Holden is telling us how he feels when he had red a very good book with an interesting person on it, then he has the feeling he wants to call up that person, he feels like meeting that person. I'm sure you will find it ridiculous, but sometimes I have that feeling to when I have red a good book, and also after this story. <BR>I find Holden a very nice person, I can't imagine him tall or anything, but I like his character. I don't like his language, it is pretty much the seem the whole book and afterwards you have the intention to speak the same way. That's not a good sign, because my mother language is not even English but Dutch! I give a few examples of whole sentences he repeats the whole time, if you count it with the rest of `bad' language, you have only left a hundred pages. The examples : I don't feel like ...; the hell; got a bang out; knocked him out; phoney; I have to puke; drives me crazy; shooting the bull; it's sort of funny; I really was; ...and all. <BR>On the other hand, I think it's smart of the real writer, because that's probably the way kids talk in New York. My opinion is that Holden seems a real person, there are so much little details, you don't believe he's imagined by a writer. I give an example ; I have figured out that the reason why Holden hates movies is because the only brother he has left over is a prostitute in Hollywood. The brother is busy with making stupid movies in stead of using his good writers qualities. Holdens' character is very good worked out, the whole book is very psychological and I believe every thing that happened.    <BR>The writer must know how it is to be depressed. I had the idea there was a whole other Holden than only the one in the book. A Holden who is happy. That are all proves the story really gets you and that you really got interfered.<BR>I think I've already mentioned that the book reads fluently. The big line is chronically and that makes it easy to follow, his flash-backs make it more interesting because that way we become more knowing about Holden. His story begins when he is at the hospital and it ends when he is going to the hospital, are whatever it is. That's a thing that bothers me, but it is also the reason why the book is so interesting and you want to know more about it. <BR>On the other hand it's funny you want to know more about it, because the story is the dullest you can imagine. You are the whole time waiting for the big `thing' to come, but there isn't anything coming, except that Holden is getting more depressed with every page. But the writer is completely honest with it; at the first page he says :\\""I don't want to write my autobiography.\\"" And in the end he lets you know that he isn't going to answer the questions you asked yourself the whole time you were reading. <BR>My conclusion is, you can missed it, that I liked the book, the character, the writing style a lot and that it is your duty of a good teacher to recommended it to your pupils every year again.",2001-11-08

I like that sort of writing but it also has disadvantages because there were also a lot of words that aren't in a dictonnary. I think it's a bit of a strange book. Most of the time it bored me because in fact there wasn't a real story. It only goes about a boy, Holden, people descripe what he does but that's it. He doesn't go through adventures. While I was reading, I've never felt tension from the beginning till the end. I like more story's when you can replace yourself with the person in the book. I never felt, I would like to be that boy, now way, he has a bored life and does nothing sensfull. Sometimes there were funny parts in it, for example : Holden asked everytime when he took a cab where the ducks rest during the winter. I like books with a lot of tension and adventure. I don't like open ends, this book doesn't realy have an open end because there nothing happened. But we also don't know how Holdens life made progress. I like to know the confrontation of Holden with his parents.<BR>The book didn't fascinate me and I was happy when I finished it.

Holden Caulfield is a pathetic person who doesn't know what to do with himself. I think J.D.Salinger did a wonderful job at this stage, he wanted Holden to be pathetic and the reader believes he is. That's something I liked very much about this book. You know exactly what Holden thinks, you know exactly how he feels and what he'll do and what he won't do.  That's a reason why I liked reading The catcher in the rye. <BR>I don't think the story was good. It was a bit boring, it are 4 days out of Holden Caulfield's life and although Salinger has described it beautifully, it didn't interest me.  Holden Caulfield's life is boring, that's why it takes so long to read the book?.  You do not feel the must to know the end, you just read until the end, not exactly to know the end. Because there is no end, the story isn't finished because Holden Caulfield doesn't die or anything, he just moves on.<BR>What bothered me about this book were the choice of words. J.D.Salinger uses a lot the same words and by a lot, I mean a lot...I didn't count it, but the word phony or helluva really began to bother me.  Every time I read the word I thought: `not again this word!' And I do not like it in a book when the author uses a lot the same words.  <br />In the beginning it didn't go fast, the reading I mean.  But once you get to know Holden Caulfield better, it goes faster, but still not interesting. I'm sorry, but for me there wasn't really a story in this book.  <BR>Of course there were a few things I really liked.  For instance the relationship between Holden and his sister Phoebe...Salinger gives you the feeling that these two have a relation where nobody comes between. Nobody can touch them, and I love that idea.  I also loved the descriptions of Salinger, the way he describes Pencey or Caulfield's life in New York...I can understand Holden Caulfield, he is just a normal teenager that still has to find his way.<br />I didn't mind reading this book, but it was too long.  The story wouldn't stop and after a while it seemed like an obligation to read just until you'd finish the book...For me that's terrible because I love reading (I read a lot in Dutch), and I don't like it when I have the feeling like it is an obligation to finish a book...But besides that, the book wasn't bad. I don't say it was a good book, I'm saying that the book wasn't bad...Salinger did a good job, but the story wasn't that interesting.  <br />(Elien Plompen)",2001-11-08

How can anyone dismiss Holden Caulfield as a mere &quot;whiner?&quot; Yes, I do agree that (on occasions) Caulfield's cynicism seems somewhat inordinate (he scrutinizes virtually everything and everyone). However, this does not negate the fact that the novel is a true-to-life and touching embodiment of the existential confusion and angst most of us have surely experienced at some stage in our lives. There were so many instances in the book where I was stunned by the sheer &quot;trueness&quot; and realism of Caulfield's observations of human behaviour. Virtually every remark he makes about people and life, every thought, every criticism, makes absolute sense and rings a bell. And what strikes me the most is that his commentaries on life are not limited by time or place. I have never been to America nor am I a westerner, yet a great deal of what Caulfield says is very familiar. Every time I turned a page, there was a statement somewhere that made me think &quot;yes, yes, I know exactly what you mean.&quot; And contrary to many people's views, I think the slow pace of the plot is all the more effective because it is real. Most people's lives are not riddled with unceasing adventures; most of us move at the same pace as Caulfield. Besides, the candor and irreverence of the novel (which are surprising even by today's standards) balance the slowness of the plot.  Finally, I must say I am impressed by the simplicity of Salinger's diction, the language is so informal and so unpretentious and this is what makes The Catcher in the Rye such a unique book.

Books are a form of entertainment, just as TV and movies are. There have been a lot of movies that were very entertaining, yet extremely stupid. Most books, however, tend to be more focused on story and plot than on entertainment. However, anything without sufficient plot to go along with it's entertainment value, whether it be movies or books, is gonna suck. This book fits into that category. Forget the critics who blow smoke and say The Catcher in the Rye is wonderful just because they dont wanna feel stupid or be the black sheep who says it's awful, in a crowd of folks saying it's terrific - American Beauty movie critics were the same way - this book has little substance, and is just a lot of fluff. American Beauty was entertaining and &quot;different&quot; and new and uncliched - but really, it was about stupid people doing stupid things. The author tried to pass it off as something &quot;deep&quot; and that we should be in awe of, but it wasnt and it stunk, much like this book. Here's my high-school book review:<br />\\""If you really want to hear about it...what my lousy childhood was like...and all that David Copperfield kind of crap...I don't feel like getting into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me.\\"" J.D. Salinger sets the tone of this story right from the get-go. Salinger captures the life of a 1940's teenager, using brutal irreverence and raw emotions in an attempt to bring  a sense of realism to an otherwise worthless story. I must admit, Salinger almost pulls it off. The story, essentially, is about three days in the life of a teenager who habitually screws up and get kicks kicked out of private school. I'm sorry if I'm not not enthusiastic, but (at the beginning) the storyline sounded lame and boring. But that's what is so odd about The Catcher in the Rye. It actually IS interesting. <br />Holden Caulfield, our afore mentioned subject, is a jerk. He's self-centered, smart-mouthed, and completely dreadful to read about. But for some reason, I found myself liking him and almost rooting for him. He comes from a middle classed, joe-average family. He's confused, frustrated, and seemingly annoyed by every little thing in life. He hates \\""phonies\\"" and he hates people who play mind games. He finds both the arrogant and the painfully insecure to be irritating. He mouths off to people he should respect, and he hurts people who don't let him have his way. Sadly, I can relate to him. I found myself thinking a lot of the same things Caulfield did. I even found myself nodding in agreement when he ranted about certain topics. I could even relate to Caulfield putting his foot in his mouth when he was with Sally. I think we're all a bit like Holden Caulfield in one way or another. I believe that simple fact is why this book has gotten such high acclaim. Caulfield is an average person with many faults and failures. He's not the super-strong hero or the smooth talking ulra-suave gentleman we see in the movies and read about in other books. There's no sappy romances or thrilling action scenes. There's not even an &quot;underdog surprises everyone and saves the day&quot; ending, either. Bottom line, there are relatively few cliches in this book, which is awesome and great, but still not enough to cover the fact that Salinger has no story here. Salinger provides us with a nice change of pace, but little else. <br />Although this story was entertaining and very interesting, I was still unsatisfied. For starters, the amount of four-letter words used throughout this story annoyed me. It just seems so uncharacteristic for a person in the 1940s to be using that kind of language that often. And the idea of a sixteen year old getting a hooker also is a bit odd. But I think the thing that most annoyed me about The Catcher in the Rye is that it lacked any real substance. Overall, a story about a day in thelife of an ungrateful, snot nosed teenager just does not cut it. I need more than that. Sure I can relate to Holden Caulfield as Salinger intends...but the question that BEGS to be answered is this: why should I care?

He reminisces about things like getting kicked out of Pencey High School, \\""the very good school,\\"" according to all whom have yet to and never will attend it. He struggles with his fellow peers who he can't quite see eye to eye with. He predicts on how his parents will feel about him leaving Pencey, \\"" Well...they'll be pretty irritated about it. They really will. This is about the fourth school I've gone to.\\"" After leaving Pencey, he figures he can stay at a hotel so his parents won't suspect he's gotten kicked out of another school. Holden thinks to himself, \\""I'd put on my red hunting cap when I was in the cab, just for the hell of it, but I took it off before I checked in. I didn't want to look like a screwball or something. I didn't know then that the goddamn hotel was full of perverts and morons.\\"" <BR> Holden was in for a surprise when faced with life firsthand instead of the \\""candy- coated\\"" life he had experienced in his elementary schools and boarding high school, Pencey. He's faced with pimps, prostitutes, strange cab drivers and just life in the streets.<BR>He calls on old friends to comfort him in his struggling downward but even they are no comfort to him. It takes time and bad experiences within the few days Holden lives on his own to see the truth. He comes up with his own resolution to face life head on. He figures that maybe he doesn't have it so bad and discovers a sort of self-respect. Every challenge he is faced with helps him discover that he is just as important as every other person on earth. He finds out that by letting his care for school, friends and life go, that there are people who care for him and would be disappointed if he made a decision like dropping out of school. Once Holden claims he's going to run away, his little sister Phoebe starts crying and Holden says, \\""I'm not going away anymore. I changed my mind. So stop crying and shut up.\\""  But for the most part, Holden realized he would be disappointing himself the most. <BR> The author J. D. Salinger approaches Holden's story with a comical irony that still captures the harsh realities of life. It's a pretty easy to read book.  Salinger portrays Holden as a person who expresses exactly how he feels on all the issues at hand without leaving the reader to wonder. It was exciting to see what Holden would do next. He was full of many good insights and pondered upon things people usually don't take the time to think about. <BR>  I recommend this book.  It captured my interest till the end. We all, as people, face hardships and sometimes feel like giving up, but we eventually pull through. Without those hardships we wouldn't be the people we are now. Everyone will take something different from this book. For me, I learned that life isn't half as bad as we think it may be. Everyone has his or her own problems to deal with. You're not alone.",2001-10-14

Salinger was a very interesting novel that everyone should have the pleasure of reading. The story tells of a 16 year old adolescent named Holden Claufield. Holden narrates his story, which takes place over a two day time period. The story starts with him in a prep school and ends with him in a mental ward. The story replicates the changes of a teenager and how they can push people away.<br />Holden retells the story of his journey in New York after being kicked out of prep school. In the two days that he spends there he has many experiences. Most of which he explains as not pleasant.<br />Holden spends a lot of time telling how he feels about people and other things in society. He often states that people are \\""phonies\\"" and how much he dislikes them. Holden seems to be lonely throughout the book and is always looking for someone to talk too. He finds it hard because he alienates himself from people. Instead of finding good qualities in people he seeks the bad. To me this represents ones depressed state of mind, in which Holden is stuck in. I have related to this book because like everyone I have been in a depressed state of mind and can some how relate to Holden.<br />&quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, by J.D.

I thought that the book was interesting. It is about a young male that journeys into New York City after leaving a prep school. The events that unfolded while he was there were interesting. The main character always seemed to be looking for something to do, which kept me reading to see what he was going to do next. Throughout the novel the main character finds out who he is and where he wants to go in life. This would be very good and interesting for someone that is just starting to discover who he/she is. The only major issue with this book that I found to be not if interest was the main characters view on life and society. If you are someone who feel that society is not fair or just, then you may enjoy this book more than I did.  Though the events in the novel are interesting and keep you reading, the amount of negativity is not. I guess that the bottom line here is; if you are interested in reading this book out of curiosity then do it.

US,41529547,RAT8J1ZIS3VUJ,0316769487,862964341,The Catcher in the Rye,Books,4,0,0,N,N,"Review of The Catcher in the Rye","The Catcher in the Rye is a novel written in the first person, is told through one large flashback, and is about a young boy dealing with himself.  The book is written in the first person, so the reader feels and hears exactly what the author is feeling and thinking.  The book is one large flash back to help the reader understand the character better.  This book captures the boy's adolescence in its worst and rawest.<BR>       This book is written in the first person so nothing is left out from the author.  When a book is written in the first person the reader gets to see deep inside the main character and get a full picture of his mind.  What the author is thinking is being conveyed to the reader in words.  These words are maybe even something that the author would never even say aloud, but are there for the reader to accept and analyze.  Holden thought of many things that he \\""should've\\"" or \\""would've\\"" said, but he didn't.  The reader got so see that shy side of him that wasn't expressed to others in the novel.  If he did come out and say something there was always a feeling of regret in him that the reader could see and could help them relate better to him.  When something is written in the third person it takes away from knowing the individual, and focuses on knowing the subjects.  The reader no longer knows the people, they know what is going on around the people.  There fore, a book written in the first person lets the reader truly get the advantage of really knowing what is going on in the mind of the individual.<BR>       This book is also written in one large flashback.  The main character, Holden, is talking to a psychoanalyst.  Where he starts off is where he left his most recent school.  He views this as a turning point in his life that brings about a whole mess of things to come.  Schools are a big part of his life, though he despises them and all that they stand for.  The fact that he has been going to boarding schools does not help that.  He is at school twenty-four hours everyday and there seems to be no escaping it.  That may be why he doesn't feel the need to do well in school, because it is just a place he feel he \\""has\\"" to be at and not a place to further his life.  Though his flashback is only about a couple days, in those days he realizes many things about himself and what his life means to him.  He realizes what school means, what his family means, and what he means to himself as an individual who is such a small part of this vast world around him.  By him expressing all of this to the psychoanalyst, it is probably also helping him realize even more that he may have been to afraid to admit ti himself at the time it occurred.  As this flashback is taking place the reader understands the character more and the character may understand himself more.  <BR>       The boy in the novel, Holden, has to deal with himself, all by himself.  This is able to show him how strong or weak his spirit and will really are.  While he is by himself his loneliness builds up into a depression.  This depression shows the reader his regrets, his sorrows, and his weakness.  This weakness leaves him vulnerable to other characters in the book.  He is open for the rudeness and rejection that comes his way.  He is inhibited because of his fear of these things also.  He does not want to be rejected therefore he won't do something.  After that he will have regret for not doing that thing.  All of this contributes to his depression and leads to his feeling of discomfort and alienation wherever he is.  When Holden is trying to figure out what to do in certain situations, his hesitation leads him into a whole spiral of questions that he lets fall upon himself.  The loneliness that he has to deal with leads him to comfort zones.  But once he arrives at those places, he realizes they are not what he expected them to be or what they used to be.  Holden had to deal with himself and he did as best he could.<BR>       This novel really captures the rawness of this boys life.  It does that through flashback and being written in the first person.  The reader sees exactly what is happening and knows what is behind that.  They know what is happening because they can see inside the authors mind while each event is taking place.  This book was very enjoyable and very well written.  It showed how the main character really worked, and was not fabricated by other opinions, that is hard to find in anything these days.",2001-10-11

Being different from someone else is a unique characteristic. The book &quot;Catcher In The Rye,&quot; deals with being different and not being yourself. The book is basically a journey through life of the main character, Holden.<BR>Holden always has trouble with applying himself in school. He has been in many private schools and managed to fail out of each. His last school ends up being Pencey, an all boy's school. He fails to apply himself in his classes except for his English class. He ends up being kicked out of school and has to return home to deal with his parents. <BR>Holden never seems to want to be alone. He gets depressed alot when things don't go his way. When he did get to New York, which is where he is from, he had to hide out for a while. He didn't want to be alone, but he couldn't go home. He was unable to go home due to a letter from the school. He wanted to wait until the letter arrived and then return home. He began calling up old girlfriends and friends and staying out until all hours. He even went so far as to buy the company of a prostitute. He ended up feeling sorry for himself and he lied to get her to go away. He always lied about something to save himself, but that would create depression. This depression led to alcoholism and then thoughts of suicide. <BR>Holden ended up going home to visit his sister. Holden ventured home and got inside the house very quietly. He didn't want his parents to know that he was there, just his sister. He had favoritism towards his little sister Phoebe, and she looked up to him. He figured things would be ok once he saw her. <BR>In the end, Holden wants to leave, saying, &quot;he wants to get away from the phony people.&quot; It is funny because Holden was phony himself. He never told the truth and he was always pretending to be someone else. He got so fed up with these people that he wanted to kill someone. He mentioned that &quot;he wanted to be in a peaceful place where phony people can't talk.&quot; Phoebe decided that she wanted to leave with him. After talking her out of it, he realized that he wasn't going to leave either. He ended up returning home.<BR>To finish this book, you have to realize where exactly Holden is telling the story from. Just by seeing the type of character that he is, you realize that he is crazy. Holden had to wait a semester to go to school, he ended up staying in the psych ward. His character made the story and symbolized his crazy mind and the moods of his character. Catcher in the Rye deals with mental problems and the reality of living with them.",2001-10-09

It is about a typical American teenager going through adolescents and experiencing human nature.  The main character/narrator, Holden Caulfield, is straightforward in expressing his ideas about everything around him. He is rebellious and doesn't cope with his problems too well.  Instead he either runs away from them or hides from them.  For example, he leaves Pencey early just because he didn't feel like hanging around the people there or the fact that he wanted to wait until after his parents received the letter about his expulsion before he came home.  He finds his life lonely and the more he ponders and contemplates his life he feels more and more depressed.<br />The way Salinger made the character really sound like an adolescent helped me to relate to Holden.  I could completely understand Salinger's style of writing despite his use of slang.  Although some reader's may not experience the same idea's that Holden brings up in the story they can certainly relate it to someone else's life.  <br />I was quite disappointed, however, that the book ended without any really big, dramatic twists.  The book ended so fast and I wish that Salinger could have carried on with the story.  I would be interested to know where Holden ends up going to school next, if he does go back to school, and what he feels about the world now that he's 17 at the time that he tells the story.<br />I would recommend this book to young adults but I would strongly discourage readers who are impressionable and inclined to imitate the narrator's words and actions.  It is something that I would enjoy reading over and over again.",2001-10-09

The story is of his removal from prep school and his return back home to New York City.<br />The book is set in modern day New York City (actually the 1950s, it is written so well it is unnoticeable). Holden spends most of time telling bits and pieces of what he thinks of people, and why he dislikes things so much. Holden himself experiences a lot in a few days, everything from beating attacked by a pimp to drinking and dancing a bar to making an old girlfriend cry. <br />Holden goes through the story mostly alone, simply because every time he visits or meets with someone, he either finds fault in them or they find fault in him, and he leaves. Holden's observations seem to show that he gets increasingly depressed as the story goes on. The story captures a period in everyone's life (usually mid or late adolescence) where everyone and everything seems depressing or without joy. The reason that so many people identify with the story is perhaps because of the depression. Depression, a state of mind that most people seem to feel at some point in their life, is universal. As many other reviewers agree, it is in identifying <br />Holden, as the narrator, states what we feel during that time, almost perfectly. Holden scrutinizes things we normally don't, primarily the way people act toward other people, whilst ignoring the way he acts. His observations range from seeing profanities scribbled on a wall and getting upset to watching a man in a hotel room put on women's clothes.<br />The overall theme of the book I would say is \\""discomfort.\\"" Holden is rarely comfortable. When he even approaches the chance of being comfortable, something always keeps him from getting there. Along the way, the book also deals with alienation and fakeness, and loneliness and deception. Overall, the book is a reminder to me that everything falls apart.",2001-09-26

It described the experiences of a young man named Holden Caulfield after he was expelled from Pencey Prep School, a boarding school for boys.  The author places Holden on a captivating journey through New York City and vividly describes every detail of it.  These thoughts, adventures, and reactions are what make the book so easy for a teenager to relate to.  J.D. Salinger created a story of excitement and intrigue that captured our attention and will do the same for you.  We strongly recommend this book to people of all ages, especially young adults.",2001-09-10

I think the principal appeal of this book among young readers is that it is profoundly comforting. To discover someone else sharing your own fears, anxieties, confusion and cynicism, comes as both a shock and a relief. I remember reading in amazement as Holden expressed thoughts I thought were mine alone. To realize that a &quot;grown up&quot; (someone of my father's generation, no less!) wrote the book and created Holden, gave me my first inkling that perhaps things weren't as bad as they seemed. For the first time, I actually began to believe my parents when they laughed off my &quot;problems,&quot; said they were just a part of growing up, and told me things would get better. I think this experience in reading the book is not atypical. Whether you like &quot;Catcher&quot; depends, I suppose, largely on your age and, perhaps, on which crowd you fit into in high school. The &quot;popular,&quot;  &quot;cool,&quot; and &quot;in crowd&quot; types probably see only a whiny rich kid with nothing to complain of. To the rest of us, Holden was a kindred spirit and we re-read the book regularly. I last read &quot;Catcher&quot; about a dozen years ago. Holden and I no longer had much in common. I doubt I will read the book again. If you are young, confused, and wondering about your place in the world, read this book. (Just don't take it too seriously.) If you are older, (or, if young, have already achieved &quot;popular,&quot; &quot;winner&quot; or &quot;overachiever&quot; status) you probably don't need to and will wonder what all the fuss is about.

However, like me and a few million other young people he can't because society won't let him. That's why he's so weird and philosophical, he wants out of the 'phony' life people box him into.He is probably trying to tell all the corporate investors that he dos'nt want to be spoon fed into society.<br />If anything I feel sory for him because I can relate, but then he can also be abstract and not really give you anything. Because of this his real truth is underneath his pride, or his lack of asteem, so in turn he seems superficial and lacking something. He's complex with the contridictions, so his character is deeper than a whiny little kid. This can sometimes be misunderstood, as just the weirdest guy ever, but he just does'nt know what's out there for him. He's scared of himself, and what is ahead, which is true of all of us. <br />Apparently Salinger had to study young people for the character of Holden, rather than writing form his own point of view.

Obviously, my perspective has changed, but the most remarkable feature of the book is its sheer timelessness.

He goes to New York City, gets drunk, smokes pack after pack of cigarettes, has a near-close encounter with a prostitute, gives away some of his dwindling hoard of cash to two nuns, calls up old girl friends, and generally fumbles and stumbles his way back to the safety of his home where all is forgiven.

But you needn't wait too long before you fall into the actual story. Unfortunately, I found it took a lot of patience and consideration to keep up with the style of writing used. It's written in the way of a story being told by the main character with too many grammatical errors and much too much over enthusiasm and repetition. But that's the real 'colour' that J.D. Salinger provides for this book.<br />Holden Caufield attends a long line of prestigious schools one after the other because he has a habit of being 'kicked out' or 'leaving' at his own free will. From this you can guess how strange his personality is. He is quite an intellectual when it comes to literature and the arts but he fails to show much interest or concentration to either. This is why schools keep kicking him out after a long period of trying to tell him to wake up and study-he fails most of his subjects. He is overall from what is described in his book-a very stubborn and yet free willed, impatient boy who wants to live quietly but not think too deeply about his future with any realistic sense.<br />The whole story starts with Holden who has decided to tell us all about what happened 'last Christmas'. After being kicked out of another of his schools, Holden knows that he will have to go home on Wednesday and face his parents giving him a huge big lecture as they usually do about the way he has been neglecting his schoolwork. But what really bothers Holden is the fact that he has to stay at school and waste his time in dormitories UNTIL Wednesday. So he decides to use the time he has left before he goes home to his own benefit. He decides to go and have a good time for a change. The book talks about what Holden does to use up the two days before going home and how he decides to run away and live in a cabin next to the woods instead and not go home.<br />This book is worth the read and worth having on your bookshelf. Holden is a very strange and interesting character and so flexible that most of us will probably find one part of him that is similar to us, you'll read the book and stop at one sentence that makes you stall because you know he's right or that the sentence is talking about you.

Holden Caulfield, the narrator of the book is a troubled teenager, struggling in school and hating those phonies who attend it.  His grades stink, but we can tell that he is one bright kid, and the way he or should i say Salinger wrote this book is raw and non-candy coated wich was the point all the other writers out there missed.  Salinger wasn't out there to write something that has that cliched good ending at the end of the book, nor a love story between two struggling teens, he wrote about the rebel inside all of us, the guy who screams to be heard.  Holden listens to that voice, sure it gets him into trouble, but he's honest and true to himself, and all those times we've neglected to listen to ourselves, we live through Holden.  Honest and dark, sad and moving, some chapters are hard to get through, and just when you think Holden can't sink any lower: he does.  A book for all types of people (hey this is the book John Lennon's killer raved about).  <br />After reading it for the first time, you'll start reading it all over again up to a certain point (those who've read know wich one), since you know what's ahead second time around it will make the dark parts even harder to take.

Most of us went to some phase in our lifes which we can relate to his. Certainly not the typical &quot;coming of age&quot; story, this book has a very well-known plot: <br />Holden Caulfield, a rich kid from Upper East Side, is expelled yet again from a preppy private school. It's Saturday, but Christmas vacation begins next Wednesday. So Holden takes off from school and goes to live to a hotel in NY. He hires a prostitute, drinks himself to unconscience, wanders around town, dates a girlfriend, and remembers his life.<br />So what's the fuss aboout a few days in the life of a spoiled adolescent facing life and getting confused and depressed? Of course, it's the character. The character is the most accurate method to measure a novel's quality. Plot and wording may be good: if the character is not attractive, the novel bombs. At least as a pleasure. Caulfield is smart, sensitive and down-to-earth. His love for his young sister Phoebe is tender but never corny. <br />The novel is hilarious because Holden is a very cool master of political incorrectness, an angry young man perfectly conscious of the phony characteristics of the game we all play. Something that surprised me a lot, not being an American nor a native English-speaker, is the amazing resemblance of 50's kid-speach with their 90's counterparts.

I remember back when i was in elementary school and my older brother was in high school and studying this book. I knew nothing about it and simply shrugged it off as a very short novel that people had to study for English class. I can also remember that several  years ago a girl once told me that i reminded her of the main character in Catcher In The Rye. I asked if i was supposed to take that as a compliment or insult, she said compliment because some of the sarcastic and funny things and the way i expressed myself reminded her of Holden Caulfield in the book. Having read the book i tend to agree with her, and i found myself laughing out loud at Holden's sarcasm and wit. This book grabbed my attention from the first page. I loved the style of writing and found that although the book was written in the 40s and some of the words and phrases are dated, for the most part the story had a contemporary flow to it, and could easily have taken place today.  I've heard that this book is banned in alot of schools and i'm thinking WHY? Is it because of the swearing? Have you heard the trashy foul mouths on some of today's youth? The language in this book is nothing compared to that. This book should be required reading by all high school students, as it paints a picture of the feelings of frustration and alienation, and not fitting into the world that most every adolescent goes through at some point, and how adults and authority figures seem to be all [people] who don't know or understand anything. This book is one that i will be reading many times. I can't believe a book like this was written back in the 40s. It's an amazing book! I now understand why this used to be such an important book back in school before they banned it.This book makes me want to read all of Salinger's other writings. When a book can make me laugh right out loud i know i've found a really special book.

It is also difficult to imagine a book where each new reading provides so much more illumination into the main character and his personality.   I can remember finding Catcher to be funny the first time I read it.  I now alternately find Holden to be walking a fine line between witty sarcasm and dangerous cynicism.  He is funny, there is no way around that, but his belittling nature also causes him to dismiss much from his life that may not be perfect, but should be included.  There is nothing that he, in the end, does not dismiss as being phony, whether it is the nuns with whom he shares a cup of coffee, the teacher at the end who most likely was just trying to help, the Egyptian wing of the museum, Pheobe's school...everything.  As soon as one little detail slips in which is not completely on track with what he is thinking whatever it is he is contemplating becomes useless, phony, not worth dealing with.  His humor is sharp and witty and I often laugh out loud while reading, but it is also an easy way for him to detach himself from a world which he no longer feels he belongs in, or wants to belong in. I can remember finding the ending ambiguous the first time I read it.  I now see it as the only way it could end, with Holden finding happiness watching his sister Pheobe going forever in circles, and being able to pretend that that is never going to change.  She is the one thing in his life which he still deems worthy of existence, and placing her on a merry-go-round is his best attempt to keep her there.  Things change and grow and move on, but Holden refuses to accept this and is yearning to stop things forever where they are, to go back to when D.B. was a writer full of dreams and Allie was still alive.  He mentions once how he used to take field trips to the museum, but how it was never the same and that takes something away from it.  Even if the exhibit was the same, YOU would bedifferent, simply by having traveled a bit farther in life, and this is what Holden is incapable of dealing with.  The ending is Holden trying to keep the one thing in his life he still truly loves exactly the way she is. I can remember finding Holden's journey to be a bit all over the place.  I now can see that there is not a single detail which Salinger does not use to illuminate Holden.  On Holden's last night at school everything is covered with snow.  He stands there holding a snowball looking for something to throw it at, but he can not bring himself to throw his snowball and disturb a fire hydrant or a park bench.  Everything is peaceful under the snow and Holden can not bring himself to alter this just as he can not handle a world that keeps changing.  Or there is Holden's history class, which he is failing.  The only topic he is remotely interested in is the Egyptians and their process of mummification.  The only thing he cares about is how to preserve things just as they are.   I can remember enjoying this book the first time I read it.  But I had no idea that with each subsequent reading I would find more and more to enjoy, and more and more evidence of Salinger's genius.",2001-07-05

I thought he was a funny smart alec who understood how rough it can be to be a teenager.  But the more times I read this novel the more I realize that, while Holden's sense of humor is funny and smart, his attitude on life is one of fierce detachment.   Through his relationship with his sister Pheobe, we can see that the only thing Holden truly loves is the past, and his only dream is to halt things where they are so that the things he loves will not change in any way.  He is still suffering from the loss of his brother, Allie, and can not stand it that someone so young and innocent could have departed so soon.  He is embittered against his brother D.B. who, Holden feels, has sold out in order to write scripts for Hollywood movies.  And he is fiercely protective of his sister Pheobe, the only thing in his life that is still fresh and innocent and the only person he truly loves.   Every anecdote and conversation that Holden has screams of this obvious longing to just stop things for a bit and not have to worry about people changing or growing up.  There is not a single character with whom he interacts with for more than five minutes that he doesn't wind up resenting due to some part of their personality which indicates to Holden that they have sold out, moved on, lost track and become phonies.  Outside of Pheobe there is only Jane Gallagher, the girl he used to hang out with, who he can view as being the same as she always was.  And although Holden mentions calling her up numerous times in the book, he never actually communicates with her in any way being too afraid of what he'd find out about her.  Especially after learning at the beginning of the novel that Jane has gone out on a date with his roommate, a known ladies man.  The idea that Jane is now facing the trials and tribulations of real life would be too much for Holden to deal with, resulting in a strong desire to talk to Jane, but a fear of what he might find out.   Holden is left with the memory of Jane as he loved her, and the real life Pheobe who he still loves, but desperately wants to preserve, thus finding peace at the end of the novel as she rides around and around, hopefully for Holden, forever on the merry-go-round.

Those who don't like the book seem to think that the book is disconnected, swears too frequently, or has no plot.  Now, I realize that some negative reviewers have differing opinions, and I respect them, because the book is different from most literature, classic or otherwise.<br />Most literature describes an event, using the characters to interact with their surroundings.  There is a defined plot, there is a defined theme, the people do normal things, and everybody who reads it gets pretty much the same thing from it.  For an example, I'll quickly examine a well-known piece of literature, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Dickens.  I am not going to go into great detail, I am not an expert on this work, but when I say &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; you see ghosts, kids with canes, and London.  If asked &quot;what is it about&quot; you might say, &quot;the redemption of Scrooge&quot; okay great.  Everyone agrees, discussion ended.<br />\\""The Catcher in the Rye&quot; is not like that.  People with literal minds hate books like this, because everyone who reads it, takes something different from it.  These people say, &quot;nothing happens, the symbolism was great, but there was no plot&quot;.  To them I say, &quot;Who cares?&quot;.  I want to meet the person who declared that every book needs clearly defined plot, theme and grammar, to be good.  Writing is about more than following the proper steps.  A monkey can be taught to follow steps, a third grade student can learn to fill in blanks.  Writing is about communicating.  Some critics look at a work of Dickens and say, \\""Now, there's a good book, that's how writing is to be done.  All the concepts are well thought out, the grammar is letter-perfect, and the word choice is outstanding!\\""  And that is great for them, I'm excited that they feel this way, now we know that there is yet another job that a computer can be taught to do, critique literature based on grammar, punctuation and spelling.  These rules are rules we give our elementary students so they can be understood when they write.  If you want to buy a book, so you can examine grammar and word usage, don't buy this one.  Salinger didn't sit down to write a book for his college English professor.  If you want to look at his work from that standpoint, then it would be an awful book.<br />Fortunately for the human race, writing is not about that at all.  Writing is not only about being understood, writing is about feeling, writing is about telling another human being, what an experience is like.  This is what Salinger has done.  He has captured the teenage experience, the anger, the frustration, the disappointment, the feeling of hopelessness, the paranoia, and the feeling of looking out at society and realizing that it's not a nice place to be.  Salinger did not write about the idea teenager, if he did, Holden would've sounded like a member of the Brady Bunch  \\""The world is a happy place\\"".  Often, people like to rationalize what happened in this book, by saying, \\""Holden is sick, he is unusual, nobody else goes through this\\"" this is not the case.  True, Holden did move to California, apparently to seek some type of counseling, but he is far from unusual, he is truthful to himself, he is telling about the world the way it is, not the way he wants it to be.<br />In the book, Salinger is communicating to two types of people.  On one hand he is telling the people whose lives have been like Holden's that someone understands them.  Someone else has been though what you've been through, it's a normal thing. And he is telling the Brady Bunch people \\""WAKE UP!  Take off your rosy colored glasses, the world is NOT one big happy place, at least not for everyone.  Yes, somewhere in the distance, there is war and hunger, but there is something more, and it's right next to you.  There are people who can't find the most basic human need, the need to be loved and accepted.\\""  Holden feels lost and alone, he feels like nobody cares about him, he feels rejected by his family, and he feels hopeless because he everyone and everything he knows either lets him down, or lies to him.  This is real life, this is what it's like to have everything not go your way.  If you are looking for fairy tale or soap opera, this is the wrong book.  You also shouldn't read this book if you are going to use a holier-than-thou attitude and judge everything that is wrong.  To read this book, you need to be realistic, and empathetic.  This book is about the bad side of life, it can sometimes be hard to follow, and you may reach the end and wonder what happens next.  Read it a few times in that case, you may learn that this kind of writing is not about what happens next, it's about what already happened, and most importantly; why?",2001-06-30

Many people walk about in an aura of pretense but never really seriously think about it. This book will change that. Every condemnation of a braggy peer, self-absorbed night club crowd, pretentious movie, show-off piano player and the serious consideration that it may be best to just leave the world behind and find a new career in a faraway western town is so sharp and well exaplified. After the Second World War, society called for a return to normalcy, including steady incomes and material status symbols. Salinger is the only writer I have read to display just how much is wrong with that and I am sure anyone reading will see how little the book's themes of psuedointellectualism, clique-monging and celebrity worship have deteriorated.

Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, centers on adolescence and the loss of innocence.  The protagonist and narrator is Holden Caufield, a sixteen-year-old boy from a wealthy family in New York City.  He has just been expelled from another boarding school for academic failure.  Holden's pessimistic outlook on life makes the reader think he has no hope left in the world.  Yet, Holden is only shielding himself from more damage to his early loss of innocence.  This moody, yet sensitive character foolishly spends his money, hoping to find a temporary haven from his emotions.  Holden's emotions only escalate and nearly cause him a nervous breakdown.  In many ways Holden can be compared to Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn.  Both teenage-boy runaways, they are keen observers upon unplanned travel routes.    Salinger's stream-of-consciousness style of writing makes the story very real.  The reader can relate and keep up with the narrator's thought process, even when he rapidly changes subjects.  Salinger's dynamic characters become genuine people in a believable setting.  Salinger's capture of adolescence in this novel is profound.  There is much in Holden's irrational decisions that make this novel very truthful.  Salinger's creation of a teenage boy, who constantly debates with himself on decisions of morality, is a character with which all adolescents can relate with in one way or another.

Salinger's controversial The Catcher in the Rye, told from the perspective of 17 year-old Holden Caulfield, explores the clouded worlds that many \\""lost\\"" young men face bitterly every day.  Caulfield's journey is not merely physical but also emotional, as it touches ideas burnt into the minds of many but expressed only by those few brave enough to confess them.  Salinger's stream of consciousness take the reader directly into the mind of Caulfield, making him see the world through his eyes, strained with emotional tension.<br /> Caulfield's train of thought serves as a link to his character.  Salinger's diction is that of a teenager in the 1950's, complete with broken grammar and frequent slang with swearing.  Caulfield's narration does more than show what happens in the novel, it shows the action through his eyes-the eyes of a self-justified teenager, trying to do the right thing in a crazy world. Almost everything Caulfield says is backed up with a short comment on what he thinks about it, from kids to life in general, giving a bit more depth into what kind of person he is each time he says something, no matter how insignificant it may look at times.  This constant manner of speech reminds the reader that the Caulfield is not a learned scholar nor an accomplished grown man, but an everyday teenager trying to get by.  <br /> The stream of consciousness in The Catcher in the Rye illustrates Caulfield's awakened, yet somewhat tainted view of the world.

Salinger (the J.D. stands for &quot;Faust&quot;) has written a book from the perspective of a 16-year-old, who is the throes of adolescence. He is self-centred and pessimistic. In my adolescence, I did identify with Holden, but each time I read the book I could never make it past page fifty. Not only is Holden's narrative redundant and cliché, but, as I soon discovered, IT WAS SOLELY MEANT TO APPEAL TO TEENAGERS. I was repulsed by this book - not because I am the child of some over-protective gay couple that loves me dearly, but because it was a waste of my time. It told me nothing about myself (the role of art, as Wilde put it, is to reflect the spectator). Reading this book was painful and boring. I gave it two chances and gave up on both. I confess with immense shame that I feigned appreciation of this book -- &quot;so good! so good!.. the BEST book&quot; -- in social situations. But I stopped fooling myself. The people who read this book over and over, aside from the scholars, are people who are addicted to things and have attempted suicide.<br />In my review for &quot;Ulysses&quot; on this website, I stated that that book (&quot;Ulysses&quot;) marked the end of literature for the next few hundred years (until a new reincarnation of Joyce/Shakespeare shows up....man, metempsychosis of the geniuses takes a while) and Salinger's book helps me in proving my point:<br />It is a theme that has been done to death. It was controversial at the time (or was it) but, as far as I'm concerned, it was in no way transcendental, groundbreaking, or any of those nonsequitors that are thrown around too much. It was, quite simply, something that this bulimic, urine-drinking recluse wrote to strike it rich, as with everyone else in our society (just because I can't sympathize with Holden, it doesn't mean that we aren't similar - I am the king of nihilists and pessimists). People like the book because it is them that they are hearing. It mirrors our society, but not in the constructive, critical way, but in a way that turns us all in little heroes, little Holden Caulfields. <br />In short:<br />Do yourself a favour.  Don't define your philological merit by how many books you have read. If literature is where you want to be, spend the rest of your life reading &quot;King Lear&quot; and &quot;Ulysses&quot;.",2001-05-07

Holden's desperate attempts to prevent his collapse start when he flees school and the book follows him round his hometown where his grip on reality begins to slip and he becomes increasingly emotional.

Salinger employs repetition and irony to portray the picture of an adolescent boy attempting to find himself in an adult world and grow into a man.  Salinger continuously inserts the same small phrases throughout his novel in order to illustrate the uphill battle Holden Caulfield faces in order to prove and understand himself.  After every statement, thought, or personal anecdote, Holden always declares to the reader, or to the character he is speaking with, that he is telling the truth.  Over and over again, Holden exerts the phrases  \\""I really am\\"" (98), \\""They really are\\"" (118), \\""I really do\\"" (9), \\""We really did\\"" (8), and  \\""I really didn't\\"" (10).  With the recurrence of these simple, three word phrases, which begin by stating who is doing it, followed by the word \\""really\\"", and closing with an affirming verb, Salinger paints the portrait of a boy struggling to convince himself that he can actually be correct and gain confidence in himself.  Another key phrase Salinger employs through Holden is \\""That killed me\\"" (160).  Whenever something \\""kills\\"" Holden he finds the event amusing and comical.  When Holden is looking through his kid sister's diary, he discovers the name she had printed in it was different from her real name.  Holden loves children's jokes and expresses his attitude toward her private joke by saying that it \\""killed him\\"" (160).  By stating that \\""it killed\\"" him repeatedly, Salinger eclipses Holden's peculiar, adolescent sense of humor with the fact that he has such a huge sense of humor.  In this way, Salinger covers the evidence of Holden's unsophisticated mind.   As well as repetition, Salinger utilizes irony to display to the reader that Holden seeks manhood and himself. On his way to Ernie's, Holden strikes up a conversation with the cab driver named Horwitz.  After conversing for a couple of minutes with him, Holden concludes that Horwitz is \\""a touchy guy, it wasn't any pleasure discussing anything with him\\"" (83).  Ironically, the very next sentence Holden extends an invitation to Horwitz to join him for a drink.  In this instance, Holden shows he wishes to spend time with anyone willing to listen to his ideas, even if they disagree wholeheartedly with them.  This characteristic of Holden strengthens the fact that he is morphing from an adolescent to an adult.  Adolescents close their minds to outside ideas and opinions, while adults share their ideas with everyone.  As we all know, realizing your problem is a big step to solving your problem.  Phoebe, Holden's little sister, correctly points out Holden's problem to him that \\""you don't like anything that's happening\\"" (169).  Instead of taking her advice Holden breaks out into an all out defense declaring \\""that's where you're wrong - that's exactly where you're wrong!\\"" (169).  Immediately following his defensive, Holden thinks to himself that she \\""was...depressing me\\"" (169), thus fortifying Phoebe's position.  Instead of taking the mature route and listening to others opinions, Holden shuts his sisters beliefs out as \\""wrong\\"" and  continues to believe that he does not have a problem.  The Catcher in the Rye delivers the inspiring story of a boy struggling to break the bonds of adolescence and bloom into adulthood.  With the use of his skillful repetitions and ironies, J.D. Salinger \\""really did\\"" masterfully create this American classic.",2001-05-07

Salinger, through Holden Caufield's use of extremes with death and temperature, displays his distaste of reality.         Death is an extreme that is used quite often throughout the novel. The book begins with Holden talking about why he is not at the big football game, and how the students were &quot;supposed to commit suicide &quot;if they lost (2). This clearly shows the distinction between Holden and everyone else in reality. He takes the normalcy of attending the football game and places himself at the other end of the spectrum, and then aggrandizes it by saying how the mere loss of a football game could supposedly result in a mass forfeiture of life. Suicide arises as an extreme measure that occurs in reality over sometimes-small things like a loss in a football game. Holden mocks this occurrence within reality. When Holden meets the three girls in the bar, his attitude labels them as the norm of girls in New York. Holden relates how the girls did not speak and then he talks about how they &quot;nearly committed suicide,&quot; when they saw an actor (74). From the beginning Holden displays how he abhors the movies. This shows the reality of how the three girls are affected by society to the point that they would go to the extreme of committing suicide to see a mere person, an actor. Holden ends up hating the girls and this parallels with his distaste towards reality. Holden also belittles a couple who were &quot;feeling each other&quot; as the male spoke about a kid committing suicide. This clearly shows how disturbed people in reality become and how Holden hates the phoniness of them. To all these stories and observations, Holden replies with &quot;It killed me (119).&quot; This remark soars in every other page at least a couple of times. In a way, it does kill Holden, for his view of the good in reality deteriorates with each of his revelations. This leads to Holden's obsession for an Odyssey-like voyage away from reality.         Temperature also playsan important role in overwhelming the reader with the depressing mood of reality. Holden uses temperature quite often to make the reader feel uneasy and uncomfortable as he reads. This lets one feel Holden's misery and allows one to incorporate the hatred of the reality through Holden's eyes. Holden characterizes the temperature in the beginning as &quot;cold as a witch's teat (2).&quot; Holden then describes why he feels that way, which includes that someone stole his jacket and gloves, while he was at his Pencey Academy. This leads to the emphasis on the appearance vs. reality of Pencey. Pencey mounts supposedly to an ambiance of well-educated and morally right men, while Holden instead shows how thieves roam the halls and rooms. The reality of Pencey scars him mentally, and impels his apathy towards his eternal suspension. The reader finds out that, &quot;At Pencey, you either froze to death or died of the heat (23).&quot; This foreshadows the extremist view of Holden. Here, he displays the lack of finding a middle area, and both ends suffering the same consequence. This also is analogous with his view of reality, that either way you are cooked. Holden relates himself to the ducks and wonders where they go when the lake freezes over. In a sense, he feels his life has frozen over and he needs to escape reality like the ducks. The most extreme form of cold temperature is ice, and that is where Holden feels surrounds him. The temperature outside never raised, it was only frigid. This shows how the reality of the world could be escaped when he departed to a house, but he always ends up cold again. He talks about how hot he felt when Mr. Antolini pats him on his head inside Mr. Antolini's house, then the next thing &quot;I [Holden Caufield] was getting sorta cold (95).&quot; The temperature relates to how people can evade reality, but they always have to come back in the end. Holden parallels the two extremes of death and temperature when he says, &quot; I kept worrying that I was getting pneumonia, with all those hunks of ice in my hair, and that I was going to die.&quot; This correlation portrays Holden's reality and its virulent extremes.         Holden expresses how the extremes of death and temperature exist in every day life, and portrays them as flaws in order to incorporate his purpose of displaying his aversion towards the reality of the world.  I enjoyed the novel and Holden's depiction of the real world, and the way the book did not hide the truth. The world is full of corrupt and phony people.

From the very first few sentences, it is clear that Holden is telling us this story as he remembers it.  He comments that he got into some \\""madman stuff around Christmas\\"" and \\""had to come out here for a while to take it easy\\""(1).  Thus the reader can conclude that Holden has taken a journey of some sort from the beginning of his problems to the state in which he currently lives.  The structure of the novel also supports this hypothesis.  It all starts the day he leaves Pencey Prep.  From there on it is a journey through the black forests of moral confusion.  Moreover, the reader can learn a lot from the diction that Salinger employs to show the developments in Holden.  As the reader picks up the book and gets through the first page, it is glaringly obvious that Holden is not the traditional narrator.  He presents himself to be immature, and the use of slang becomes a vital part of the book.  This immaturity presented in the diction can best be observed in the analysis of Holden's sexual confusion toward girls.  He comments that \\""if you don't like a girl, you shouldn't horse around with her at all, and if you do like her, then you're supposed to like her face, and if you like her face, you ought to be careful about doing crumby stuff to it...\\""(62).  This mental train of thought, resembling that of a child's, shows that he has a sense of morality that is being challenged, which serves to teach lessons to make him more mature in the future.  It is also important to note that what he is battling is the fact that he is not like the average Pencey Prep boy who only lives \\""to give her the time.\\""  He thinks that this is a weakness in him as he realizes through the episodes with the pimp that the whole world is just as corrupt.  Overall, through the use of structure and diction, Salinger gets to the center of Holden's confusion about morality, while crafting a great work.  Many claim that this great novel is for anyone who is at all confused in life about morality or just having a tough time.",2001-05-03

Yet, Holden Caulfield (the main character) has to use them to build up his character and portray part of the theme.

And while &quot;The Catcher In The Rye&quot; is a good book, and a really good book, I must say, I have read better. It really isn't the one of the worlds Wonders, believe it or not. <br />Holden is a cynical guy, charming, nice, open, honest, sweet and funny, a rebal at times, way critcal, and pretty much a liar. And in the book he mentions what phonies everyone are. Yet, he, at times, was phony too. Since I read the book a long while ago it's pretty hard to remember, but let's try. Holden lies at every chance he gets, calls up girls he says he hates, becuase he wants to make out with them, judges people by how their suitcases look and cost, and wants to marry a girl cause she's pretty. But Holden? Phony? Never! <br />Still, you can relate to him. Holden doesn't feel like he belongs, and everyone feels like that sometimes.

He just spends his parents' money. And I find it really pathetic that his only real friend is his sister!  The use of language is always the same:he uses a lot of negative words. And the whole book is about 4days, it is way to detailed. And that gets boring after a while.

But after a while, and after I had finished this book, I found it a quite amazing novel! Why? Because of several things.<br />Let's start with the style and the language of J.D.Salnger. I think his style is very different from any other book I've ever read in English. He has a, quite genius, way of telling everything very detailed and, in my opinion, very true.  The use of his language annoyed me sometimes, because it consisted of a lot of repetition. He used words like `crumby', `old', `buzz', a lot, and after a while, I hated that! The thing I did like was the way he sometimes wrote dialect words. For example:  \\""wuddayacalit\\"" or something like that.   Then we have the characters of the book. For me, they were extremely realistic. Not that I had the need to identify myself with them, but I recognized all the different types in a certain way. I'm not saying that I liked them (I think Holden is a rather phony guy himself, to tell you the truth!), but I liked the way they were described and became realistic to me. Finally, I'm going to say something about the content of `The catcher in the Rye\\"" In my opinion, the story is both original as interesting. It wasn't a book that bored me after 10 pages, because it is full with adventures that Holden goes trough.  I also liked Holden vision on everything. His remarks were often smart, to the point and well thought, although they were sometimes exaggerated and childish. <br />So, what I can conclude is that this novel has a lot of different qualities. Some of them are good and some not. But overall, the good qualities dominate and they make the book really worth reading. I wouldn't recommend this book to everyone, because it is written for a certain, young, public. The only thing for me that's left to say is: \\"" All you youngsters out there, read this book and it will catch you to!\\""                  <br />M.Geerinckx                    Engels",2001-04-27

(This time, it's Pencey Prep.)  His teachers had found him to be incompetent and an underachiever.  After coming to the conclusion the so-called \\""friends\\"" he had made were phonies, Holden decides he has no reason to stay.  He packs his bags and leaves, deciding to \\""take a vacation\\"" in New York before returning to his parents' inevitable wrath.  Told as a monologue,  The Catcher in the Rye  not only describes Holden's thoughts and activities throughout these few days, but it also goes back to his past.  He describes some of his true friends, how his parents and childhood were,and gives reasons for his actions. (Like deciding not to have sex with a prostitute.)  These few days can probably be best described as a developing nervous breakdown, a result of his unexplained depression, impulsive spending and generally odd, erratic behavior.  However, life continues on around Holden as it always has, with the majority of people ignoring the changes that occur in him- until it begins to get them seriously ticked off. Progressively through the novel we are challenged to think about society's attitude to the human condition - does society have an 'ostrich in the sand' mentality, a deliberate ignorance of the emptiness that can characterize human existence? And if so, when Caulfield begins to probe and investigate his own sense of emptiness and isolation, before finally declaring that the world is full of 'phonies' with each one out for their own phony gain, is Holden actually the one who is going insane, or is it society which has lost it's mind for failing to see the hopelessness of its own existence?

I read this book during my early adolescence while at high school and I was surprised and bewildered and perplexed. I then got involved in reading it for a second time whilst looking out for other works by this writer, the short stories and &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot;, I even wrote a class assignment essay about it and later on at the University I put myself through the tortuous task of authoring an overview of J.D. Salinger's work, his main themes and preoccupations. I seem to have misplaced both of them and cannot find them, and I stand as speechless as I did the first time I acquainted myself with the author.<br />What I can say with certainty, is that this novel is Art in every sense, not a character sketch per se, not an alienation novel either, but a work of art that masterfully eludes all criticism in that it cannot be contained in one person's critical viewpoint without having a fundamental element of the book being overlooked and compromised in the process of analysis. My tentative observation, at this point in life, is that it is a prolonged haiku, a meditation on being young, idealistic and confused, a delicately drawn between-the-lines depiction of an uncaring, and hypocritical (&quot;phony&quot;) society afflicting the sensitive individual with both its vices and virtues, a starting point for endless adolescent discussion. But I would also like say to all young readers out there to not take this book too seriously, it can be as deadening and nihilistic as it can be sensitizing and sincere. Salinger is very talented writer but he is also deeply uncertain and troublesome, enigmatic as well as poetic, self-defeating in his world view, caring for the world and despising it at the same time, of this world and unable to live in this world or compromise even a minute part of his thoughts for a greater community value, a religion, a philosophical system of thought, a human relation, a cause etc.<br />Good God (and this is only a figure of speech.), thatwas tiresome.

Salinger until I picked up this cheap little copy a few days ago. My only knowledge of the book came from Mark David Chapman and the killing of John Lennon two decades ago. I sat down with it right away and quickly became engrossed in the story told by narrator and main character Holden Caulfield. It's absolutely incredible that this was written in 1951. The language is slangy and fresh enough to make anyone believe that it was written close to today.<br />The book is an account of a few days in the life of Holden Caulfield, teenager and cynic. Caulfield gets kicked out of his prep school and wanders around New York City for a few days, trying to avoid his parents and having a few interesting encounters along the way. All of these events are related to use directly through Holden's worldview. This worldview is depressingly downbeat, as Holden views most who tramp through this world as &quot;phonies&quot;. To use one of Holden's favorite phrases, what &quot;killed me&quot; about this book is Salinger's ability to transform extremely arcane sensations and emotions into prose. When Caulfield talks about his dead brother Allie, he mentions how red his hair was. To show the reader how red it was, Holden talks about a day he was golfing and turned around and saw Allie about 150 yards away watching him. Great imagery! I could actually see his red hair while I was reading this. I loved Caulfield's hunting cap, the imagery of his being the catcher in the rye, and the ducks and frozen fish in Central Park. All point at Caulfield as something deeper than an angst-addled teenager slumming through New York. Caulfield is on a quest to save kids from his own fate. He achieves this in a sense at the end with his kid sister Phoebe.<br />I'm thirty years old, which is still young enough to understand how Holden feels. I went through a stage where I felt exactly like Holden. Everybody does to some extent, I think. The trick is to survive it and not let it destroy you.

I can honestly tell you that it has been quite a while for me.  The Catcher in the Rye focuses in upon that particular aspect of teen life: depression and self-gratification.  The main character, Holden, wants to be a &quot;catcher in the rye,&quot; a savior of the innocence missing in the world around him, a world that has let him fall over the cliff into adulthood alone.  He is tossed into a world that he knows very little about and must survive.  This book is an excellent story and a masterpiece.  It never should have been banned anywhere, but I can see why it was. Local color seems to play a big role in this book, the dialect and slang used by the characters like &quot;ya&quot; &quot;trynna&quot; and other &quot;lazy American&quot; talk.  The presence of nightclubs and their role in New York's society is blatantly shown as incredibly important to both sexes.  The illegal obtaining and consumption of alcohol is also a tie-in and customary past time for teens in the early fifties.  Prostitution also ran rampant around that time, providing a multi-million dollar per capita business in New York alone.  The recovery from WWII is also present as many women are still working and men coming home from the war are basically left at home, lest they force their wives out of their only chances at earning some money.  Another direct reference to subjects taught to me in History class is when Holden attends a movie at Radio City Music Hall about WWII and his reference to the Atomic Bomb.  This was present in the minds of most Americans at this time, the horrors and sheer power of the atomic bomb, and the fear that Russia and Germany may turn their scientific advancements in the atomic field on America during the Cold War. I have always dreaded any English teacher's favorite words: &quot;This book is due…&quot;  Being an honors student I have heard this many, many more times than I ever wanted to in my life.  I have always made it a point to NOT read the book because they always said, &quot;Oh, you'll love it!  It really is a good book, I promise you.&quot;  To tell you the truth, I was seriously considering not reading this one either, but then I thought of the previous experiences with novels assigned to me by my history teachers.  I couldn't think of one bad book I had ever read for History class aside from the textbook, so I read it and I am immensely glad that I did.  This book embodies everything I stand for: misery, depression, solitude, atheism, and just plain not caring.  Throughout this book, Holden proves the ignorance and stupidity of mankind and their uncaring and unthinking nature.  For example twice he attempts to start conversations with his cab driver.  Each time they either showed apathy or contempt to his attempts to brighten their days.  How often I have tried to make conversation with someone I didn't know just so they couldn't say that I hadn't and virtually every time I have been snubbed while their noses stayed upturned to the world.  This book is an excellent novel for anyone who is missing something in this world and wants to be a champion and help others while the rest of the world stands by and watches with apathy.  This book opens all its readers to the world of a teenager, something that few books I have ever read have been able to do accurately.  I have read books from my Mother's bookshelf about the psychiatry of the teenage mind.  I would like to ask the authors of books like that one thing: If every teenager is different, as you have blatantly stated in you book, then how can you make generalizations like you do?  This novel makes no generalizations, it is not about every teenager, it is about one, and that one experiences different people in his time in New York the same age as him, and they are all different.

He makes critical, and often times humorous, observations of the adult world.  He is able to see through all the &quot;phoniness&quot; and &quot;crap&quot; he encounters in New York's underbelly of bars and night clubs.

Holden's standing at the edge of the cliff represents his adolescent stage in life and his nearness to becoming an adult himself.

I can compare this book with other that is very similar, this is &quot;Der Steppenwolf&quot; by Hermann Hesse. In this book the main character, Harry Haller, is a misunderstanded guy that is sure that he is a very rare kind of human who had another side, a dark side that is like an animal and it come out and fight with the human side.  This same theory is in The Catcher in the Rye, tha main character, Holden Caulfield, is a misunderstanded guy that have this both sides that always fight, the human Holden and the animal Holden, so he get depressed and he seems to have no goals in life.  But this book also has a pretty cool humor, because Holden is a cynic teenager that doesn`t worry about and always have nothing left to lose. Also is a very special guy, who can despise the most complex art or science, but in the other side he admire very little details like a good dancer or his sister(better his death brother).

I mean it, it really is. But it isn't the literary Olympus many claim it to be.  Holden Caulfield is immature, crude, lying and hypocritical, yet he's also caring, sincere, open, and likable. All of that blends to make him also charming  The story reads similarly to Virginia Woolf's experimental fiction, &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;, though more focused, not as severe in its wandering, and less of a bore because Salinger is a better writer than Woolf.  Did I say &quot;less&quot; of a bore&quot; than &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;? Yeah.  Holden really is completely likable; the kind of kid you'd want to hug every time you saw him, but he rambles and much of that rambling is unrelated to anything of importance, much as is the case in &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;. &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is a fast, easy read, but there are still times when I just felt like putting it down for good, because it too often becomes little more than a featureless droning, much like &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;.  Salinger had a spectacular ability to build a character with just a few lines of dialogue. There is a host of personalities within the covers of &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; and though we rarely get more than a glimpse of each we come away feeling that we know far more about them than is included in the written word.  Holden is both remarkably perceptive and remarkably naive. This keeps the narrative interesting where it would otherwise bog down again.  Emotional content is most often flat, because Holden has a too frequent habit of flat out telling us how depressing this and that and him and her and . . . and . . . and, is. It's one thing after another, told without any feeling, and by three quarters of the way through the reader starts thinking, &quot;so what&quot;. There ARE parts that will make you stop and think, &quot;wow&quot; in a subdued, even melancholy way, but don't expect to have to set the book aside while you wait for the tears to dry up. It isn't going to happen.  It's difficult in the extreme to find a discussion  You'll find a good-sized handful of things that WILL make you stop and say, &quot;Hmmmmm.&quot;, but if you're expecting to have your beliefs regarding self, life, societal woes, or the fundamental goodness/evil of mankind challenged then you're reading the wrong book. That isn't going to happen, either.  Is &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; a great book? A work of unparalleled literary genius? Heck no.

Salinger, one of the most interesting American writers of today. Salinger has shocked readers by exposing the naked emotions of a young man. Salinger's story brings us to the city of New York where the main character, Holden Caulfield, searches him to find truth in life. Salinger attempts to expose the &quot;phonies&quot; of the world and touch confused adolescents. This novel should be regarded as a handbook for all young people who feel they are all alone in their confusion in the world.              Readers will either love &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; or hate it completely. The young man, Holden, attends prep school to prep school in search of something. He is forever getting kicked out for poor grades that he is all too smart for but, Holden seems to be side tracked with the &quot;phonies&quot; all around him. Holden even tries to help the &quot;phonies,&quot; tries to save them from their fake world. When he gets kicked out of his most recent school he begins to miss the familiar &quot;phonies&quot; in the big city of New York.               In New York, Holden discovers himself through the people he meets during his short visit. The author wants his readers to sense Holden's fear and anger. In one of the few interviews he has granted he said &quot;His own childhood was much like that of the boy, Holden Caulfield, in this novel.&quot; Holden's adventure in New York in a symbol of independence. The boy chooses to face the real world, instead of trying to escape it. At one point, Holden says to his sister, &quot; I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all...and I'm standing by on the edge of some crazing cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff.&quot; This passage reveals what the title means.   The main character is insightful, full of raw emotions, and truth. Teachers across the country have called this novel filth and unfit for school literature. Jack Gordon, Miami school board member, said of the novel &quot; anyone that calls it 'obscene' has misread it. The book takes you from bars to prostitutes to Holden's dear little sister. Although there is alcohol and other illegal things, the message is not vulgar. It teaches us to fight against the stream of conformity. Holden dreams of escaping the city as he says to himself, &quot; a little cabin somewhere...and live there for the rest of my life...near the woods, but not right in them because I'd want it as sunny as hell all the time.&quot;",2001-01-16

The blatent honesty of Holden Caufield is what makes this book so interesting.  Some people find it offensive, but really, that's what the book is all about.  Holden would never not say something just because he's afraid that they would be offended.  Just as when Holden says that people who get off topic are more interesting, this is the case.  Holden never really has an obvious direction, but it doesn't hurt him because he is being true to who he is.  Holden is the ideal person because he is completely honest.  This book is for every person in the world because you will question yourself, your morals and your actions.  That is so important and for most people it never happens.  I recommend reading this as an adult as well as a teenager because if you can relate to it as a kid, you should also relate to it as an adult.  Kids are so much more honest with everyone than adults.  (that is why Holden can talk to Phoebe so easily).  You should still be able to relate to this as an adult.  If you can't, look deep inside yourself, because there are tons of ways to relate to this book.  I don't want to give away too much of this book, but I have to tell you that you must read it.  If you don't start questioning who you are as a person by the end of the book, read it again because there are so many questions that Holden asks himself that apply to all humans.

His next three days are spent in New York City where he dwells on his emotional problems and his cynicism toward life. This book is unlike any other I have had the chance to read.  J.D. Salinger is able to write this book through the mind of a 16-year-old boy in 1945.  What is unique about his writing is that I can relate to the character's feelings in 2001. Salinger is an extraordinary writer.  I felt as though I was a cynical young man in lonely and bustling New York City.  I feel his emotional problems that are induced by the recollection of his dead brother and the younger sister at home he misses and loves.  This passage from the book shows the problems he had with the death of his brother, &quot;I slept in the garage the night he died, and I broke all the goddam windows with my fist, just for the hell of it.&quot;  The way Holden describes it, he makes it sound like nothing, but you know that it is a serious problem.  Laughter is inspired by Holden's description of his past roommates and there habits.  Some whistle, some are slobs.  No matter what Holdens emotions encompass, they are always easy for me to relate with.  Salinger doesn't focus on imagery much, and little symbolism is used.  Salinger uses figurative language to draw the reader into Holden's world. This is an excellent book for teenagers to read.  In researching the book, I found that it has been pulled from the curriculum of several schools due to the language used in the book.  The book was written in 1945 and uses several slang terms that would be heard in that decade.  This is the only aspect of Salinger's writing that I found uninteresting.  Terms like, &quot;chewing the fat,&quot; and &quot;sonuvabitch,&quot; are outdated and don't appeal to me.

Reading the novel again, it perhaps made me more desolate than I was before, and I dropped out of school a few months later.  SOme might say that the book, then, had a negative impact on me.

Salinger.  This novel puts a bold new perspective on issues concerning society.  Salinger writes about a rebellious teenager who is diving head first into the adult world.  His views on the situations and people that surround him have the ability to change our own thought processes and become more like the author himself.<br />Salinger uses a teenager named Holden with a short temper and a bad mouth to convey his thoughts on society.  Holden is developed with amazing detail.  The story is told through his eyes, which allows the reader to feel what he feels and analyze Holden's every thought.  Holden has a very negative view of the people around him and society itself.  He thinks that everyone is playing a role in order to use people and get what they want.  To make his thoughts even more confusing, Holden has very fond memories of his childhood.  Holden longs for things to be like they used to be, when he was innocent and carefree.<br />Salinger uses the character of Holden, someone people understand and relate to, in order to present his views on society. Salinger has the ability to back away from society and look at it from the outside.  When he is apart from the deception and lies which represents society, Salinger has the ability point out it's mistakes and illustrate it to the rest of the world.  Most people can't see through the wrapping paper that covers our lives and prevents us from seeing what actually in the box.  Salinger has the ability to see reality, and through Holden he has revealed it to us.  If Salinger had given us these life-changing views straight up without the connection of Holden, then people wouldn't have been able to comprehend their true meanings.<br />This book has changed my life and my outlook on the surrounding environment.  I can now see the true motive behind people's actions and I know that not everything is what is appears to be.As you read this book, look past the foul language and the bizarre actions of Holden.

D. Salinger hits the proverbial nail on the head in relation to teenage issues.  The main character, Holden Caulfield journeys from his school (Pencey) to his home in search of some measure of spiritual meaning in life.  Through his experiences and adventures, Holden gains much insight on the meaning of life.  This issue of finding meaning in life is pertinent to adolescents everywhere.  In this way, Salinger addresses concerns of teenage readers and relates them to Holden.      <br />     Whereas the transcendentalists of the nineteenth century fled to nature to look for meaning in life, Holden flees to the urban sprawl of New York.  During his travels, he has many paradigm-shifting epiphanies: his brief relationship with a prostitute demonstrates the folly of superficial love; his disastrous date with an old friend teaches the same; and his encounters with profane graffitti around his younger sister's school teach him that the world is a cruel place and that no place is exempt from the sacreligious nature of humans.  In such, Holden's brief journey can be seen as a representation of the period of time in which adolescents define themselves morally and spiritually.        <br />     Young Holden, in his rambling, elects to fight against all things phony.  The iron of his morals and beliefs is forged in the fiery cauldron of the &quot;real world.&quot;  All teens experience this formative period when they choose which morals/beliefs to accept and which to reject.  Indeed, it is only after this system of beliefs is established that one crosses the brink from the awkward uncertainty of adolescence to the calm assuredness of adulthood.      <br />     The simple conversational prose of Salinger's THE CATCHER IN THE RYE conceals many truths about life.  In holding such deep meaning, the novel is worthy of any reader's attention.  However, it rings even clearer to the teenage reader in that Holden faces many of the same momentous questions that adolescents face every day.  Reading this novel is similar to talking to a close friend about life.  Very few works of literature can claim that honor, but Salinger's masterpiece does.  Holden's thoughts are the same as those of Thoreau and Emerson; they merely apply to a more modern setting.  If one wishes to read about explosions and fireworks, they could just as well see a movie.  However, if one wishes to ponder the meaning of life, they need not look any further than to the nearest copy of THE CATCHER IN THE RYE.",2000-12-13

This book captivated my imagination and I found myself in another world.  Holden is a mature male who is faced with everyday challenges which he needs to overcome to suceed in life.  Holden is on the outside of the world looking in, so he has first hand accounts of events which he can describe to readers.      A great trait this novel has is that it was very personable.  Readers can relate to the experiences Holden overcomes, and sometimes even trips across.  Readers are reminded through out the literature that Holden is human like everyone else.  He makes mistakes and must pick himself back up and through his actions readers can see the strength it gives a person.      Throughout &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, Holden Caufield describes his world how &quot;his eyes&quot; see it.  He is very bold and tells it like it is, for example throughout the the novel he vividly describes the phonies who are intertwined throughout people in everyday life.  The Catcher really teaches you what you don't like about yourself and gives you a passage way to start over on.  He condemns all the horrible people who are man-made by envy etc. and makes readers want to change people people for the better.  This book will open your eyes, and hopefully inspire you to look deep inside yourself and criticize.",2000-12-11

The first time I read the novel several years ago I was swept up by the character Holden Caulfield and the way in which I could relate to him as a fifteen year old boy, but my opinions regarding The Catcher in the Rye changed somewhat when I read the book more recently as a college undergraduate.  I can still see the way in which the book could be appealing to a teenage male filled with angst regarding that society that he lives in, but now I think that this novel could have been written in a much better way.<br />The Catcher in the Rye only loosely follows a plotline and therefore the events in the novel lack any noticeable connection or continuity except in the most general of ways.  The novel, the it addresses serious issues, was not masterfully crafted on any literary level other than its characterization of Holden Caulfield as a teenager rejecting the &quot;phony&quot; society he is being forced to join as he grows older.  Despite all of it's faults however, The Catcher in the Rye did start my interest in literature and showed me that things that I cared about could be addressed in literature.  The Catcher in the Rye isn't a flawless novel, but it is a must read for any teenager.  Hopefully future generations will be inspired by Salinger's wonderful use of the teenage character.",2000-12-10

As one of the people who love this book, I would say, this book is a really good to read. The writing style of this book is very different from style of other books. Also, it is easy to understand, so it doesnt bore the readers. It causes the readers want to read it. In addition, the author, J.D. Salinger has the great skill, which makes the reader feel like being in the story. These are the reason why The Catcher In the Rye is a really good book to read.   Many Best-Sellers have attracted people with their amusement of the contents. In this sense, The Catcher In the Rye has a great resource of enjoyment for readers. In my case, I never got bored of this book, during entire period of reading. The first interesting part of the book is its distinctive language use. The main character, Holden Caulfield, tells the story as a narrator. He recites and describes his feelings in vivid expressions as if he speaks to readers. As he narrates the story, he uses the language, which would be used in conversation between close friends. For example, he says,  I was the goddam manager of the fencing team. Very big deal. Wed gone in to New York that morning for this fencing meet with McBurney School (P.3). It makes the reader to be more friendly and comfortable with the book. Holden Caulfield is a teenager boy and story is mostly about his experiences of many new things as a teenager. This gets me excited, because I am also a teenager. Things he has experienced and the way he has felt are quite friendly to me. I feel something that adult reader would not feel. Thus, the teenagers would enjoy this book a lot more than adults would.   To tell the truth, this book was my 3rd or 4th book I have read in my life, except the books I read from school. With the books I have read, I had some troubles reading it, because there were some parts that were totally confusing and hard to understand. Also, thevocabulary often stops flow of reading, because I had to look in the dictionary quite often to find the meaning of the words. However, The Catcher In the Rye was very easy to read and understand. I hardly ever looked in the dictionary.  I could easily finish one chapter without getting stuck. Moreover, I didnt need to think hard while I read this book. I could just relax and enjoy it. Thats one of the reasons why its really a good book to read.   While I read this book, I have realized the authors great writing ability. He has the ability to make the readers feel really being in the story. Also he makes the readers feel the same way as Holden does. For example, I felt depressed when Holden was down, and I felt quite delighted when Holden finally gets what he wanted. While I was reading, I was so deep in the book, so that I didnt recognize my brothers calling me and couldnt feel the time passing. In my opinion, the author, J.D. Salinger is a fantastic writer who can manipulate the readers while they read. The author who can put you so deep inside of the book, you just got to find out what will happen next. The most main reason why The Catcher In the Rye is really a good book to read, is because of the authors ability.         The Catcher In the Rye is a very nice book to read, especially for teenagers. This book well describes a teenagers feelings of experiencing new life. This book is fun and humorous that keeps the reader away from sleeping or getting bored. Its also very easy and simple; it gives you a comfort and relaxes. Its totally different from the other books, which would give you a headache. In addition, this book is well written enough to get you really in the story. The author makes the readers fall into the story and feel the sadness and happiness as the story goes along. Its the author that creates the different world in your mind.

Holden Caulfield, the main character, is much more than a teenager going through a tough time.  He is a very special boy with special needs.  He doesn't understand and doesn't want to understand the world around him as he calls everything he doesn't like a \\""phony\\"".   Holden doesn't express his normal thoughts or feelings.  He doesn't trust his teachers and parents because he can't understand them, not because he doesn't like them or wants to separate from them.  There is not much in Holden's world that he understands. The only people he trusts and respects are Allie, his brother D.B, and Phoebe, who is his younger sister.  Everyone and everything else that he knows of are \\""phony\\"".  Holden uses the word phony a lot of times to describe his feeling about the people he doesn't like and things he rejects: his roommate Stradlater and Ernie for example.  He also calls his school, Pencey Prep, a phony school because he doesn't like most of the students and the teachers.  Holden said, \\""The more expensive a school is, the more crooks it has\\"".  Holden is being kicked out of Pencey Prep because he is failing four out of five classes. Although he's left with many memories, some are good but most are bad.   Holden, being scared of going home from his parents, leaves school a few days early and travels to Downtown, New York.  On his way, he runs into many people such as his sister Phoebe. Not only did Pencey Prep made him think it was a phony place to be, but Holden thinks the whole world is a phony place to be after seeing Downtown, New York.  Holden's little sister, Phoebe, offers to help Holden because he wants to find out who he wants to be in the future of his life.  Holden realizes what he really needs is to move out in the west and live in a cabin to escape from all the phony things in the world, and not be involved in anything with anyone.  What he wants to discover is a relationship that will be suitable for him to live under.  J.D. Salinger, the author of the book, wrote this book so well that when you are reading with your mind concentrated on the story, you imagine it as a reality.  You think you are going through the phase that Holden is going through in the book.  Salinger uses a unique style of writing because you imagine you are in the conversation yourself.  I can't imagine this story having any weaknesses because of the way Salinger describes the scenes and the experiences of Holding.  Thus, it has much strength as Salinger awaits you to find out impatiently what will happen next in the story.  I would recommend this book to teenagers 14 years of age and older because The Catcher in The Rye is a interesting life story, for people who are confused about their lives, or don't know what to do with their lives and want to freshen up a bit.",2000-12-06

Salinger is well detailed and descriptive classic novel about a young mans life. I feel that this book should be mandatory for all 9th grade English classes to read. The story is basically a three day diary of a young man named Holden Caulfield. Holden has just been kicked out of or expelled from a preppy, Catholic, all boy, private school in Pennsylvania. He is sixteen and a junior in high school. The experiences of a sixteen year old young man in 1950 effectively and exactly relate to experiences of sixteen year old in the year 2000. Tough the slang may differ a bit the details and plot still exists in today¹s every day high school boy life.    This book starts of with a junior in high school being expelled. Written in first person, we the readers listen to what Holden has to say about being expelled, his feelings and his preppy school called Pencey Prep. Holden first tells us about his older brother who is in Hollywood, his younger brother who passed away and of his sister in elementary school.  Then he jumps in to describing what a phony his school was. The details and myriad descriptions put us the readers into the dorm environment or in to the Pencey Prep. hallways and student life. Holden tells about his friends which aren¹t really friends but instead just plain perverts that use girls, sporty jocks, and the usual nerdy pimply dorks.  He soon decides he has three days left till he has to be home hat he will just leave the school right away and go explore the streets of New York. This is where the adventure and typical high school boy routine begin. On many occasions he is at a bar wanting alcoholic beverages and sometimes he gets them, and others he doesn¹t due to under age. Then he is stuck spending the night at a friends house because he has nowhere else to stay. Then he is left with wanting or having a prostitute for the night. He is also thinking about all the guys at his old school. He gets back flashes of what they usedto talk about and in many cases the main topic was sex, which is very typical of high school boys even tough you may not know it. As you continue on reading you begin to think the thoughts he is thinking, feel the sorrow for his brother, and kind of miss the jerks he has left behind. Until he wants to visit his sister to tell her he is going away. In the end the story takes a big U-turn. It takes a U-turn because we the readers are positive that Holden is going to go far away until he tells his sister he isn¹t going anywhere.    As you have just read, I have given you, the reader a well detailed and thorough summary of the book. This is exactly what  J.D. Salinger has done in The Catcher of The Rye. This book does not have any weaknesses what-so-ever just many great strengths. I would recommend this book to sophomores and above. The recommendation is for this age level because once you are a sophomore then you have the actual high school environment and feeling inside of you. This book would be good to read as a class in freshman year only to show a different style of writing that uses redundant words such as ³phony² and to show a vastly descriptive classic novel. <br /> This book is intentionally for people who like to have something seem real to them or enjoy to read about how the grass was green or how he left and on what day and so on. J.D. Salinger does a marvelous job on writing a novel on three days of a young man¹s life. Many authors would have left these great details and descriptions out but Salinger chose to keep them which is the whole purpose of this unique, classic, truthful, high school novel.",2000-12-05

The book is a story of Holden Caulfield telling his life of a three-day adventure he had.  He had recently been kicked out of his third prep school, Pencey because he was flunking every single class except English.  Scared to face his parents, Holden decides to leave early from Pencey Prep and travel downtown, New York.  On the way, he runs into many different people such as taxi drivers, three girls from Seattle, a prostitute, two nuns, his little sister Phoebe, and a former teacher.  Holden gets sick of the friends around him at Pencey prep thinking that they are &quot;phony&quot;; leaving for New York only showed Holden that the entire world is &quot;phony&quot; also. Holden wishes to escape from this world of \\""phoniness\\"" and decides he wants to be away from people, a place where nobody will know him, so he does not have to be involved.  J.D Salinger has created a masterpiece.  He uses a style of writing where you think you were in a conversation with the main character in the book.  It's as if you were talking to Holden as he was telling you his adventure as he searches for himself.  In the novel, J.D Salinger points out that Holden's little sister Phoebe would care to help him.  I find the relationship Holden has with his sister is the heart of the book.  Holden expresses himself to Phoebe the night he visits her, and explains to her the one thing he wants to be.  \\""I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all.  Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around-nobody big, I mean-except me.  And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff.  What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff-I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them.  That's all I'd do all day.  I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.  I know it's crazy but that's the only thing I'd really like to be.\\""(pg.224-225) Holden expresses what he wants to do for the first time to Phoebe and I find this special and touching.  The last scene of this novel was also very touching.  Holden was at the carousel with his sister Phoebe and was watching her ride.  As he is watching her, he thought to himself, \\"" I felt so happy all of a sudden, the way old Phoebe kept going around and around.  I was [almost] bawling, I felt so happy, if you want to know the truth.  I don't know why.  It was just how she looked so nice, the way she kept going around and around, in her blue coat and all.  God, I wish you could've been there\\"". (pg.275) The relationship he has with Phoebe is the perfect relationship he has been looking for.  This kind of bond is the type of bond that makes Holden seem like a real character. I found this quite interesting because, he just wants to keep young children, like his sister from becoming \\""phony\\"", and to watch her act like a kid, makes him feel happy.  This made the novel more enjoyable to me. This novel didn't have many weaknesses in my point of view.  It had so many strengths that made this book seem as if his story was reality.  This novel was written, as if it was a true story, it has no plot. The things J.D Salinger points out just happens, like life, you never know what is going to happen, you just have to accept and appreciate it as God hands it down to you. Holden accepts the life he has to live in for he is a struggling adolescent entering adulthood.    While you are \\""listening\\"" to the story Holden is telling you, it is easy to relate to one of his many situations.  It might come across your mind that you may have said \\""That has happened to me before\\"" or \\""I know what he's talking about\\"".  That is the best part about this novel.  Many people can relate to Holden's story.  Once you get through the symbolism of the novel, you will realize the things J.D Salinger tried to point out. This book is a long life lesson.  People these days try to please others rather than speak their mind, which expresses the &quot;phoniness&quot; in people.  I recommend this novel to everyone because it will give people a different, fresh, and new point of view on life.  Anyone who is confused about life, or wants to examine the mind of a young adolescent should read this book.  Also, if you are the type of person who likes to be kept thinking about the novel after reading it; \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" is the book for you.  You will be touched by the experiences Holden Caulfield goes through, and can feel the pain and confusion he is feeling.

Salinger is a book about a teenager in search of himself. Because he does not know who he is, Holden Caulfield, the main character, goes on a quest to try to turn his life around because the life that he has been leading is not the one he wants. Holden knows who he doesn't want to be so he uses that knowledge as a guide on his quest. He doesn't want to take responsibility for himself because he is not ready to deal with the world. In particular, his descision to leave Pency early and the conversation he has at the end of the book are examples of this quest and how it never ends.  Holden's quest begins when he is \\""given the axe\\"" from his boarding school. Right before he leaves he gets in a fistfight with his roommate because, \\""Stradlater was a dirty stupid sonofabitch of a moron.\\"" This fight was the spark that lit the fire for Holden because he realized that he wasn't happy and that he was surrounded by phonies which is the one thing that he cannot stand. Holden decided to leave soon after this for two reasons, so that he can get away and have a break from responsibility before his parents find out about his expulsion because he \\""...didn't want to hang around anymore\\"" and because he is tired of being surrounded by \\""phonies\\"" at school. He took a break because he \\""figured my parents probably wouldn't get old Thurmer's letter saying I'd been given the axe till maybe Tuesday or Wednesday.

I didn't want to be around when they first got it.\\"" The reason behind his escape is that he needs to figure out who he is before he can deal with reality.  At the end of the book Holden talks about a psychoanalysist who asks him questions about his future. He is not able to answer these questions because he has trouble taking responsibility for himself because he just doesn't want to deal with things like school and life in general. He never did any schoolwork and henever cared much when he got in trouble for not doing it. Holden does not know any reason for what he thinks and he can't explain himself.  He just wants to be left alone to figure things out for himself. This is not the end of his journey but he is definitely closer to understanding himself.  I thought that this book explained a lot about what life is like for some teenagers who are sent off to boarding school. Some teenagers are sent off so that they can find themselves spiritually. Holden is an interesting character and the way that the author lets him come across is very true to life. The language, tones, and actions of Holden make him seem like a real person.",2000-12-04

Holden Caulfield, as portrayed by this author, was merely an actor on society's stage, hoping to find the right exit.  <br />In some ways I find myself relating to Holden - often times annoyed by the world's fakes and `phonies'.  Those people who put on warm smiles and yet stare cold eyes.  But aren't we all those such `phonies' at times, putting up fronts, keeping out the spectators of our soul?  I don't feel the intensity of Holden's alienation from the world was completely justified.  His senseless vulgarity and disregard and distaste for those around him made the immaturity of his character quite clear.  Perhaps all of this controversy was a front put up to protect himself from the world.  Maybe he had the illusion that if he hinders himself from the rest of the world that life's pain and anguish would never again taint him.  This is illustrated by his last two lines: \\""Don't ever tell anybody anything.  If you do you'll start missing everybody.\\""  Life is full of both happiness and misfortune.  If you shelter yourself from it, you are merely cheating yourself of life.<br />Don't misunderstand my review; it is just critiquing Holden's character.

Salinger. It was published for the first time in 1951. The main character, Holden Caulfield, sixteen years narrates his own story from the time when he has dismissed from his third private school to return Ill and in a state physical and mental shock, to the shelter of his home in New York three days later.  Before this novel, J.D. Salinger was of basic non-literary status. The Catcher in the Rye was his first step onto the literary playing field. This initial status left Salinger, as a serious writer, almost unique as a sort of free agent, not bound to one or more schools of critics, like many of his contemporaries were. This ability to write freely, his status as nobody in the literary world, was Salinger's greatest asset. Holden's story is in first- person narrative, and is told in Holden own language with unconscious humour. It is just before Christmas and Holden Caulfield, has been kicked out of the exclusive Pencey Prep, a school in Pennsylvania. Life at Pencey was dreary, artificial, and of course, expensive. It was the latest schools were Holden got the ax. Understandably he's in no hurry to found his parents. So He takes his stuff and what money he has and went to a hotel in New York City. There he passed few days living new experiences. He is involved with a variety of persons including taxi drivers, two nuns, three girls from Seattle, a prostitute, and a former teacher. And the sad ending in which Holden ends up in a mental ward is depressing. ´The Catcher in The Rye´ gives us a chance to catch quick, half-amused, half-frightened glimpses of ourselves and our contemporaries, as Salinger confronts us with his brilliant mirror images. What makes the book so good is that it is realistic and believable. It could happen to anyone. In fact, it happens to hundreds of teenagers every year. Besides, out of all the characters in popular literature, Holden is probably one of themost &quot;real&quot; to his readers. All this is not to say that only teenagers will like the book. They are more likely to like it, but anyone could like it. It is a realistic description of the world. Many of the things said in the book about human nature are so dead-on accurate that is it damn near scary.",2000-11-18

In Holden Caulfield, Salinger has created one of the most enduring and sympathetic literary characters of all-time. I think it is safe to say that most of us, whether we'd care to admit it or not, can find a little bit of Holden within ourselves. Holden is the perpetually troubled child. Emotionally wrecked by an ugly, unforgiving world which shattered his hopes at an early age, Holden constantly rants and raves. Hurling venemous attacks on the evil &quot;phonies&quot; whom he believes are to blame for his woes, Holden ostracizes himself from everyone except his loyal sister Phoebe. The beauty of &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot; is that the story, and the sentiment it provokes, is still relevant a half century after its original publication. True, most of us won't go as far overboard as Holden does, but certainly his disenchantment will strike a universal chord with many people at various times of their lives. So go ahead and read it again and don't be surprised if you have a different perspective of Holden with each reading. Perhaps you'll loathe him, or perhaps you'll love him.

Holden Caulfield has become the patron saint of world-weariness, bewildered vulnerability, and a perplexity leaning on desperation.  The novel has a narrative voice that verges on the vernacular but consciously avoids it and a minimal plot that is set into action by a single decision.  The sorrow in `Catcher in the Rye' does emerge from solipsist insularity but rather from a deep concern for innocence lost, or in peril.  He feels genuine empathy for, among others, a disregarded child walking on the street, ignored by his parents, in danger of being hit by passing cars, another child in a movie theater who is hushed by his mother, herself weeping at a dramatic scene, when he says that he needs to use the bathroom, and young whore named Sunny, too ignorant to realize her own sullen wretchedness. But perhaps most foreboding of all is his fear that perhaps one day his beloved little sister, Phoebe, may become corrupt, or at least a part of our corrupt socety.

Catcher in the Rye, as everyone hopefully knows, is the story of one weekend in the life of Holden Caulfield. Holden has just failed out of another Prep School and, after getting in a fight with his roomate, flees to New York City, where he holes up in a hotel rather than go home to face his parents.<br />As his story unfolds, we learn that he had a beloved younger brother who died of leukemia and Holden has been extremely troubled since then.  In one of the more memorable images in literature, Holden explains that he sees himself as &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; (he has misremembered a Robert Burns lyric as &quot;if a body catch a body coming through the rye&quot;).  He imagines a flock of little kids running through a field of rye along a cliff precipice and he is poised at the edge trying to catch them before they fall.  But Holden isn't just troubled by the Mortality of others, as one character tells him, he is spiritually troubled by the morality of others.  He rages against all of the &quot;phonies&quot; and &quot;mean people&quot; he meets.  What could make a young man feel more ineffectual and helpless than taking responsibilty for the mortality &amp; morality of the whole human race?<br />This story of a young man coming of age, trying to understand the human failings of those around him, is one of the great works of Literature &amp; should rank much higher on the Modern Library list.<br />GRADE: A+",2000-10-31

Some of these may be pleasant and happy; others will be full of complete remorse and utter disgust.  Let me elaborate.  The book is a faltering attempt to sum up the life of the author.  Although he embellishes the story quite a bit, it is easy to see the \\""subtle\\"" hints that this is what his life was like.  The author creates a boy that, by normal standards, has absolutely no connection to 97% of the world's population.  By trying to create the feeling of sympathy for the main character, he further entrenches the belief that this person isn't like the rest of the young boys that exist today.  Maybe I am off by trying to impress the fact that there should be some type of connection between a regular fiction book and the people that are reading it, but it is absurd to think that the book would be anything to somebody my age.  The small problems that arise with the Holden have no relevance and cannot add any depth or meaning.  Despite this, I think that there is some value to the book and that it might have a saving grace.  What might that be?  Well there are some well-written parts.  The author has a great attention to detail that, in some cases, can really put the book out as a classic.  This can be overlooked by the poor detail in some parts.  Another bright spot would be the accurate recreation of some of the ideas that a young boy may have.  This doesn't last though.  Yet, despite some good detail and some nice insight, this book is an incapable novel that doesn't deserve any recognition or praise.  The author clearly doesn't understand that a normal person just doesn't need to read about some childish little boy that can't get a grip on his own problems or have the resolve to get help.

However, I had always heard how excellent it was and I knew that I had to finish it. This novel is truly a classical piece of American literature. Although this book is most definately your typical classic with heroes and victims and morals that leap off the page, Salinger's novel is real. <br />Holden Caufield is an unusual narrator. He is honest, which is refreshing as he notes the superficial world surrounding him. This honesty alienates Holden from society, for he will not conform to the typical schoolboy personality of those that he has lived with all of his formal education. He becomes a watcher and analyzes the many people he encounters. In due course, he confirms the human being as a indecisive creature that thrives on interaction. Regardless of ho hard Holden tries to separate himself from his clueless, high society parents, Phoebe, his sister, and the kind intentions of others affect him. <br />Through his many experiences prior to his sixteenth Christmas, Holden reaches some realizations, but eventually he has concluded that life cannot be planned. Also when we bear our souls and secrets to someone, in the absence of their company, we find ourselves very lonely and regretful. <br />Some may find the language inappropriate for a novel, but it is only reality that is found on the pages. This book has remained on banned book lists for so long because people are afraid of the truth, and many can find the confusion or cynicism that Holden possesses in themselves.

And I can say without doubt that this is the worst book I have ever read.  Yes, you probably disagree with me.  You'll say, &quot;Well, it's a classic book!&quot;  The only reason you think it's a classic is because you've been TOLD it's a classic.  But hear me out.  Here are some reasons this is the WORST BOOK EVER:<br />1) BAD writing.  My english teacher told the class that when we are writing anything, the opening sentence has to grab the reader's attention.  Read the first page.  It doesn't make me want to keep reading at all.<br />2)  No plot.  This book just keeps going and going.  It's just Holden rambling on and on.  It doesn't make any sense.  When he is talking to Mr. Spencer, he is thinking about ducks.  No, that's not a typo.  He's thinking about DUCKS.  Maybe there's some deep symbolic meaning in that.  That gets me to my 3rd reason.<br />3)  TOO MUCH SYMBOLISM, NOT ENOUGH INTERESTING STUFF: the problem is, too many writers focus on deep meanings and symbolism and themes instead of having an interesting, fun to read book.  Personally, when I read a book (such as my favorite, The Wild Road, by Gabriel King) I read it because it is interesting, and it's a page-turner.  I can't put it down.  This book is the exact opposite.<br />4)  A lot of profanity, not enough INTERESTING STUFF:  yes, there is quite a bit of profanity in this book.  And a lot of fighting. I just skip the fight scenes altogether, skip Holden's conversations about ducks, all that filler.  Cut all that stuff out and you'll only have about 10 pages of reading material.  I'm not exaggerating.<br />Anyway, that's about it.  I'm sure I'll think of something else later.  If you have to read this for your english class.. well.. I feel sorry for you.",2000-10-18

He doesn't want his parents to know that he was kicked out, so he gets a brilliant plan to spend a couple days in New York City before heading home.  In this short period of time, Holden has many adventures. One that sticks out the most to me is his night at the Lavender Room. He meets three girls visiting town from Washington. One in particular really enjoys dancing, and Holden dances with her for several songs. Another memorable moment is when Holden goes home in the middle of the night to see his sister Phoebe. She is one of the few people he truly loves.  One major theme in this book is death. There is some reference to it in every chapter. Several times Holden mentions suicide. This leads you to believe he isn't exactly normal and that he will end up in the position that he explains at the end of the book.  Many people ask him if he is going to apply himself when he goes back to school. He tells them he doesn't know and there is no way he would know until he actually goes back.

One of a very  Holden-ish sayings is when he is leaving Pencey, early morning and yells,  &quot;Cya later ya bastards!&quot; or something like that. What a great way  of expression!   Holden continues on, and experiences love, and well,  you'll have to read what happens. Definitely a great book, so pick it up  and give it a read. Then get surrounded in Holden's world and go buy a red  hunting hat!",2000-09-15

Salinger's over-hyped classic, we meet Holden Caulfied an overly sensitive, introspective, aspiring Ph.D. who goes underground in New York  for two months to find enough money to finish med-school. Through several  telephone conversations (the ultimate dramatic device) with his aggressive  domineering father (one can only imagine the Kafka influence), we see  Caulfied as an innocent lamb on the cusp of an emotional meltdown.  He  finds himself taking up many degrading jobs -from coroner to male escort-  all in which he repeatedly and unconvincingly sees the dark side of  humanity, until he ultimately finds himself in a nihilistic state of  despair. <br />Though his language may be course and even archaic by today's  standards, the story, in its entirety, along with Holden himself, is not.   His faux-naïf tone and attitude are unconvincing at best and utterly  annoying at worst.  The prototype of the cynical young adult, he has  inspired generations of readers to avoid medical school -with all its  `pretense and pomposity'- and become summer camp counselors- the purported  `soul cleansing' career he ultimately chooses.  We can thank this book for  the surplus of unemployed camp counselors that continue to wound the  economy.<br />I think that what bothers me most about this book, is that being  a med-student myself, I found the grad-school portrayed here -Pency school  of medicine- to be an inaccurate, and potentially harming version of the  seemingly sacred institution after which it was carelessly modeled (brief  note in passing: possibly the most annoying part of the book was when he  called the Pency school of medicine `ennui-city').

Holden's minute by minute interpretation of social  encounters is so well documented (the writing style used in this novel is  unmatched) that the reader will frequently relate with his sentiments.

I also think that by saying Holden is a typical American teenager, you are overlooking a few  things- for one, his emotions may be typical, but his environment and his  affluence are certainly not. He speaks for the American teenager, but he is  definitely not the typical American teenager. Remember- Holden is telling  his story from a psychiatric hospital. Salinger made Holden an extreme. His  actions were extreme, his words were extreme... he did not wear a mask...  he was an effusive, uninhibited bundle of emotion, of ambivalence.  I think  that nearly every teenager feels the same as Holden does. We all, at times,  wish to be saved from the adult world- while at the same time, we think  that we deserve to be treated like adults.  When I read it the first time,  I was Holden's age- 16. I saw Holden as a genius. I thought that he spoke  truth with every word. Now, I am 18.. even in those two years I have  developed a new perspective on Holden and his &quot;genius.&quot; When I  was 16, I didn't see Holden's immaturity- I saw his actions as brave and  noble. After reading it again yesterday, I was able to really see his fear  of growing up and his fear of the inevitable. I saw it when I was 16 in  myself; I guess I just recognized it as something else. I think I am  rambling. I guess that my point is- read it when you are Holden's age-  absorb the 16 year old world as much as you can.. then allow yourself a  while, and read it again.. because I appreciated it this time in an  entirely different way.",2000-07-23

Salinger's brilliant coming-of-age novel, Holden Caulfield, a seventeen year old prep school adolescent relates his lonely, life-changing twenty-four hour stay in New York City as he experiences the phoniness of  the adult world while attempting to deal with the death of his younger  brother, an overwhelming compulsion to lie and troubling sexual  experiences.<br />Salinger, whose characters are among the best and most  developed in all of literature has captured the eternal angst of growing  into adulthood in the person of Holden Caulfield.  Anyone who has reached  the age of sixteen will be able to identify with this unique and yet  universal character, for Holden contains bits and pieces of all of us.  It  is for this very reason that The Catcher in the Rye has become one of the  most beloved and enduring works in world literature.<br />As always,  Salinger's writing is so brilliant, his characters so real, that he need  not employ artifice of any kind.  This is a study of the complex problems  haunting all adolescents as they mature into adulthood and Salinger wisely  chooses to keep his narrative and prose straightforward and simple.<br />This  is not to say that The Catcher in the Rye is a straightforward and simple  book.  It is anything but.  In it we are privy to Salinger's genius and  originality in portraying universal problems in a unique manner.  The  Catcher in the Rye is a book that can be loved and understood on many  different levels of comprehension and each reader who experiences it will  come away with a fresh view of the world in which they live.<br />A work of  true genius, images of a catcher in the rye are abundantly apparent  throughout this book.<br />While analyzing the city raging about him, Holden's  attention is captured by a child walking in the street &quot;singing and  humming.&quot;  Realizing that the child is singing the familiar refrain,  &quot;If a body meet a body, comin' through the rye,&quot; Holden, himself,  says that he feels &quot;not so depressed.&quot;<br />The title's words,  however, are more than just a pretty ditty that Holden happens to like.  In  the stroke of pure genius that is Salinger, himself, he wisely sums up the  book's theme in its title.<br />When Holden, whose past has been traumatic, to  say the least, is questioned by his younger sister, Phoebe, regarding what  he would like to do when he gets older, Holden replies, &quot;Anyway, I  keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of  rye and all.  Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around--nobody big, I  mean--except me.  And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff.  What I  have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff--I  mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going.  I have to  come out from somewhere and catch them.  That's all I'd do all day.  I'd  just be the catcher in the rye and all.  I know it's crazy, but that's the  only thing I'd really like to be.&quot;<br />In this short bit of dialogue  Salinger brilliantly exposes Holden's deepest desire and expounds the  book's theme.  Holden wishes to preserve something of childhood innocence  that gets hopelessly lost as we grow into the crazy and phony world of  adulthood.<br />The theme of lost innocence is deftly explored by Salinger  throughout the book.  Holden is appalled when he encounters profanity  scrawled on the walls of Phoebe's school, a school that he envisions  protecting and shielding children from the evils of society.<br />When Holden  gives his red hunting cap to Phoebe to wear, he gives it to her as a  shield, an emblem of the eternal love and protectiveness he feels for  her.<br />Near the beginning of the book, Holden remembers a girl he once  knew, Jane Gallagher, with whom he played checkers.  Jane, he remembers,  &quot;wouldn't move any of her kings,&quot; and action Holden realizes to  be a metaphor of her naivete.  When Holden hears that his sexually  experienced prep school roommate had a date with Jane, he immediately  starts a fight with him, symbolically protecting Jane's innocence.<br />More  sophisticated readers might question the reasons behind Holden's plight.   While Holden's feelings are universal, this character does seem to be a  rather extreme example.  The catalyst for Holden's desires is no doubt the  death of his younger brother, Allie, a bright and loving boy who died of  leukemia at the age of thirteen.  Holden still feels the sting of Allie's  death acutely, as well as his own, albeit undeserved, guilt, in being able  to do nothing to prevent Allie's suffering.  <br />The only reminder Holden  has of Allie's shining but all-too-short life, is Allie's baseball mitt  which is covered with poems Allie read while standing in the outfield.  In  a particularly poignant moment, Holden tells us that this is the glove he  would want to use to catch children when they fall from the cliff of  innocence.<br />In an interesting, but trademark, Salinger twist, Holden  distorts the Robert Burns poem that provides the book's title.  Originally,  it read, &quot;If a body meet a body, comin' through the rye.&quot;  Holden  distorts the word &quot;meet&quot; into &quot;catch.&quot;  This is  certainly not the first time Holden is guilty of distortion; indeed he is a  master at it.<br />This distortion, however, shows us how much Allie's death  has affected Holden and also how much he fears his own fall from innocence,  the theme that threads its way throughout the whole of the book.<br />By this  amazing book's end, we must reach the conclusion that there are times when  we all need a &quot;catcher in the rye.&quot;  We are, indeed, blessed if  we have one.",2000-07-21

The theme of catcher in the rye is Holden wanting to be a catcher of children to save them from growing up to adulthood.  He has not been able to make  the transition himself.  This is shown by his constant finding fault with  everything (the phonies) but he then justifies the phonies to make them  acceptable to fit into his life.  He is constantly disappointed with people  and things which creates a state of anger and frustration. For him things  and people are either totally right or totally wrong. He can't find the  balance of reality.  Holden begins the story as a young man who is  dealing with just being kicked out of Prep School. He is trying to deal  with the reaction to how he feels how his parents are going to react and of  the perception of others on him as well. His encounters with Mr. Spencer,  Ackley and his roommate Stradlater present Holden finding fault with  everything (the phonies) . Nothing is good enough for him.   His ramblings  on throughout the book is a dialogue to the reader (or therapist)  demonstrating his inability to organize his thoughts in a logical and  reality base. Just as he finds distaste for many things and people, he in  turn justifies the events or people as to make them not so bad.   His  self-deception creates a false perception thus producing his distorted view  of his reality.     Holden leaves the stability of the prep school to  go to New York City for many experiences that would be more typical for an  adult than what a young boy of his age would normally experience. He sees  himself as an adult capable of drinking, having sex and just being  self-sufficient. He also thinks of himself as being better than others as  in his relationship to his experiences with the nuns.  He wants to  experience the luxuries of adulthood but not the responsibilities.   In  the latter part of the novel, Holden is sick physically, because of lack of  sleep and proper nutrition, as well as, mentally sick. His thought  constantly returned to his sister and his perception of protecting her.  He  doesn't want to have things change as in his reaction to the items in the  museum. They stay the same. The scene where Phoebe is on the merry go round  Holden finally stops assigning absolute values to things and finally breaks  emotionally. He cries releasing his tears of delirium The book Catcher in  the Rye has many themes and underlying ideas but one basis of confusion.  Holden sees adulthood as a cliff to fall off, instead of a mountain to  climb. His pessimistic perception of the world is what really does him in.  He is his own worst enemy.  If Holden could only realize it is possible to  commit no mistakes and still lose...this is not a failure, just life.",2000-07-06

The story is meant to be a simple one, but the complexity of young Holden Caulfield, the opinions he holds, and the manner which he so candidly  speaks them, keeps the reader guessing and thinking long after the book has  been finished.<br />Holden is so straight forward, so easily spoken, that I  couldn't help but smile at his written thoughts, even when they  occasionally seemed petty and immature.  Now, don't get me wrong, I love  the book and I love the character, but you have to admit, he does tend to  gripe.(just a little though)<br />I doubt there are many of us who have  already forgotten our teenage years(some of our fellow Salinger readers are  still in them)but if you have managed this awe inspiring feat of memory  loss then I'll clue you in.  They were awkward.  And the author's use of  sprawling, disjointed,  narrative does a good job of thrusting that fact  right back into our face.  We, as Holden demonstrates so well, experimented  with opinion, were quick to judge our peers(an unfortunate number of us  were on the losing end of that trait), heard our speak grow sharper, and  realized that &quot;phonies,&quot; as Holden so casually put it, were  everywhere.  <br />Then came dorm life and the first meeting with our very own  Stradlater.  Obnoxious, vain, indifferent, and strangely likable even with  these faults.  Don't you think Holden cared about Stradlater in a way?   Granted, they did fight, and hurtful words were thrown around, but I found  it next to impossible during my own school years to easily push someone I  spent so much time with aside, even when that time wasn't necessarily  voluntary.  I doubt Holden would be any different.  Part of me wishes I had  been given the chance to find out. <br />Salinger does something amazing with  this book.  He helps us remember.  Even as I've been writing this ramble of  a review, memories of friends I haven't seen and places I've been just keep  popping into mind.  Holden states at the end of his story: &quot;I don't  know what the hell to say.  If you want to know the truth, I don't know  what I think about it.  I'm sorry I told so many people about it.  About  all I know is, I sort of miss everybody I told about.  Even old Stradlater  and Ackley, for instance.  I think I even miss that goddam Maurice.  It's  funny.  Don't ever tell anybody anything.  If you do, you start missing  everybody.&quot;<br />It is funny.  How things remind you I mean.  And how  things once so difficult seem so humorous and easy in hindsight.<br />Folks,  don't let this book slip through your fingers.  Grab hold, read slowly, and  soak in what it has to say.  Even if it does ramble.  <br />Just like me.",2000-06-10

I first read this book a few years back when I was 16 years old.  It was assigned to us for  an English class. I suppose that's how most teenagers get their first  glimpse of Holden Caulfield.       Most of the reviews have already covered  what I consider to be some of the more critical themes within the novel.   However, I wanted to point out a portion of a rather recent movie that  deals eloquently and poignantly with the major theme of emotional paralysis  that Salinger so lucidly portrays by way of Holden.  &quot;Six Degrees of  Separation&quot;, a movie that stars Stockard Channing, Will Smith, and  Donald Sutherland, contains an incredibly articulate monologue related to  the aforementioned theme.  It's one of the most artfully done movie scenes  I think I've ever viewed.  I urge you ALL to rent this movie &lt;in  addition to the scene related to Catcher, it is a fantastic film&gt;.  <br />    Furthermore, I wanted to commend Salinger on one of the most accurate and  forthright portrayals of a clinically depressed teenager I have ever  encountered within all of literature.       The beauty of this novel, for  me, was the inclusion of all of Holden's faults w/o apologies.  Finally,  when we look at adolescents today and recognize the same fear, foibles,  insecurities, and hubris that we see in Holden I think it behooves us to  realize that all of these perceived character flaws are without  premeditation and more so are the result of a naivete that is probably the  closest thing we have to innocense in society today.      The quality of  the reviews of this book is truly a testament to the universality of the  adolescent experience.",2000-06-08

If you can sit down and read at anytime, this is definitely a book for you. Or if your the kind of reader that doesn't  always have lots of time to read, this is for you too. I always hate it if  I have to stop in the middle of a chapter. Well, in this book, you don't  have to. The chapters are nice and short. You won't always feel like you  are missing out. But in this book, it is not likely to happen. Once you  start reading, you will be hooked. Probably to the character Holden  Caulfield.   He is a the main character of the book. You will be  attracted to his spontaneous attitude and his free-speaking mind. But you  wouldn't like his negativity about life. The thing is, he is not afraid to  do or say anything. If he feels like doing something, he will. But there  are sometimes when he won't do anything at all. His excuse is that he  wasn't in the mood to do it. I know people hate to do things, but they end  up doing it because they have to. For example, school work. Kids hate it,  but they end up doing it. Not him. He doesn't care what happens, he doesn't  care about anything that happens to him. He doesn't even care about what  goes around in the world. For example, when he gets kicked out of school.  He doesn't care about his parents or his future. If I got kicked out, I  would freak out. Or the time when he lost all of the school's equipment. Or  when he was in the park. He was soaked and out in the freezing weather. All  he did was lie down on the park bench. He kept talking about how he was  going to catch pneumonia and die. He didn't care if he did, all he thought  about was the future. How his parents and loved ones would react. He didn't  try to warm himself up or anything.   But if there is something you got  to love is his attitude and mind. How he is such a free-speaker and a great  liar. He was such a free-thinker. He would always say what was on his mind.  He would never hesitate, but he would regret a lot of things. Also, he  didn't try to act in a way he wasn't. That's what he hated most, phonies.  He wasn't a hypocrite either. Some people hate the way people act, but then  they act just like them, not Holden. Also, I liked it when he would meet  phonies, he would get so pissed at them. It killed him.   One thing I  admired about him was his ability to lie so well. Throughout the book  Holden tells multiples lies to everybody. But he is able to say them  without hesitation and he isn't concerned about what might happen next. He  just goes with the flow, he is the slickest and smoothest talker I have  ever seen.  The thing that bothers me about him is his lack of  motivation and his money management problem. He barely tries at anything. I  think he is one of those people that have the skills, they just don't use  them. Also, he has to learn how to manage his money. If I knew someone who  blew money like that, I would be so aggravated.   In all, I really  enjoyed this book, and I recommend it to other readers.",2000-06-03

Salinger's, \\""The Catcher in the Rye,\\"" is a classic novel of an adolescent who discovers the truth of human nature when he leaves school early.  The themes and observations expressed in this story are classic,  for all generations.  The characters are realistic, and well defined.  They  are also easy to identify with, especially the lead character Holden  Caulfield.  Holden tells us the story of what happened to him during  the days after he left school, which he would soon be kicked out of, and  went out into New York City on his own.  During the time Holden is in  school, and when he is out on the street, he meets many people.  Holden is  able to give a character depth and recognizable characteristics simply by  telling a one story about the person.  For example, the story of a boy he  barely knew named James Castle.  James refused to take back a comment he  made about somebody; he was then ruthlessly beaten by the kid and his  friends.  When he could no longer take the abuse he gathered up the  strength to run and jump out the window, killing himself instantly.  James  is only talked about this one time in the novel and doesn't contribute  anything crucial to the plot.  He does, however, show us different emotions  of Holden (such as caring for others) as well as telling us about another  interesting character who some may be able to identify with.  There are so  many characters Holden meets, even the small ones add to the story and  leave an impression on the reader.  Through Holden's short journey of  self-discovery, he evolves as a character and goes through many emotional  changes, ranging from depression to overwhelming joy.  He starts as a  depressed adolescent who's angry at the world and its \\""phonies.\\""  After  meeting so many of these adult phonies, who he despises, and realizes that  his dream is to protect the children, like his beloved sister, from  becoming phonies.  By the end of his journey, he realizes this dream is  unrealistic, and that youmust let children live and enjoy their innocence  and freedom.  This shows how people can change and how you have to take  time to realize the truths of life.  \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" is told  through the viewpoint of Holden Caulfield, a young teenager.  When he  describes the way people look, or an outdoor landscape, the descriptive  language is limited to a teenager's vocabulary.  Although he can observe  people accurately, his description of his surroundings could be more  detailed.  If he did do this, the book may have not been as realistic.   Though the story is great without the description of physical  characteristics, I think they would have made the reader feel more  connected to Holden by seeing the surroundings through his eyes.   Today, \\""The Catcher in the Rye,\\"" is hailed as a classic for all time.  This  however, was not always so.  When the book first came out in 1951, parents  were afraid that their kids would leave school, and that the adult language  would corrupt their young minds.  This is highly ironic in that this is  exactly what Holden wanted to protect from happening, and many people felt  he was causing the corruption of children.  \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\""  has connected, at some level, with almost all of its readers.  It is a  timeless story of self-discovery and realization.  The characters are  memorable and captivating.  This is one of the great American novels.",2000-06-03

Have you ever just had enough of everybody's stupid, phony attitudes and this tainted game that we call life?  You feel like you're all alone, there's no one that will listen to  you, and the ones that do turn out to be perverts and phonies.  Are they  all crazy, or is it me?<br />This is the attitude that Holden Caulfield, a  disgruntled 16 year-old, takes toward life.  He's just flunked out of  another school, his younger brother Allie is dead, he's a virgin, and to  top it all off, everyone around him is a phony.  Holden is alone in this  superficial, corrupt world he lives in.<br />What amazes me most about A  Catcher in the Rye is it's incredibly controversial beginnings when it was  first published.  The book took place and was published in the 1940's, and  society was based on being right and proper.  Things like hollow  conversation just for the sake of conversing defined what Holden held as  \\""phony\\"".  Holden hated phonies with a passion, and throughout the book made  brutal, dead-on observations about the world which were stated in crude  dialect.  This caused much uprising in society, and was stereotyped as  \\""evil\\"" and \\""insignificant\\"" by the common \\""phony\\"" book reviewer of the time.   Even serial killers were found with the book on them.  Mark Chapman, the  man who murdered John Lennon, was found with the book in his pocket after  the crime.  As you can imagine this didn't help the situation at all.<br />In  the real world, evil was personified as Holden Caulfield.  People reacted  to the book just as people reacted to Holden in the novel.  Holden was  considered a rebellious, ungrateful, disrespectful teenager that, although  rare, is a worldwide epidemic.  But if you see past the narrow-minded view  that people tend to look through, the book is a testament that this  rebellious teenager is a person.  The book shows that Holden, although a  sarcastic, nasty, unlikable guy, is a person inside who is just tryingto  save the virtue of innocence.  <br />Holden sees the world as perverted and  narrow, and has a nervous breakdown when he sees innocent children about to  fall of the cliff.  This cliff is a thought of Holden's of which he states  when asked what he wants to be when he grows up.  Holden says that he wants  to be a catcher in the rye.  He envisions children playing on a field of  rye, and next to this field there's a cliff.  Holden would catch the  children if they didn't look where they were going and accidentally ran off  the cliff.  There is incredible symbolism in this statement.  The children  represent childhood innocence and purity.  The cliff, or what lies below  it, represents the tainted, impure \\""game\\"" of life, in which so many people  have fallen.  These people, the phonies, are what Holden despises most.   Holden demonstrates his desire to save innocence when he finds that  someone's written \\""f*** you\\"" on a schoolhouse wall.  \\""I thought how Phoebe  and all the other little kids would see it, and how they'd wonder what the  hell it meant, and then finally some dirty kid would tell them- all  cockeyed, naturally- what it meant, and how they'd all think about it and  maybe even worry about it for a couple of days.\\""  Holden rubbed the mark  off, and felt extreme hatred toward the person who wrote it.<br />Holden hated  everything.  Everything he held sacred turned out to be a disappointment.   A girl in which he thought was innocent and pure turned out to be \\""given  the time\\"" by a suave roommate of his.  Another girl whom he dated was such  a phony it almost made him vomit.  He gets roughed up when a disgruntled  pimp comes around to collect more than Holden owed for a prostitute whom he  didn't even have sex with.  An old teacher that finally understood where  Holden was coming from turns out to be a pervert when he's found patting  Holden's head in the middle of the night.  Nothing sacred and nothing pure,  and the worse part was that Holden was, self-admittedly, too \\""yellow-belly\\""  to do anything about these things.  A boy lost in a sick world, helpless to  its evil, and yet Holden's the crazy one? Holden speaks the brutal truth,  and admires others who do.  For example, Holden said that he really admired  this kid, James, that Holden knew, who said that another kid, Phil, was a  conceited jerk.  Phil was much bigger, and he and six other jerks went into  scrawny James' room and beat him up, wanting him to take back his comments.   James never took it back, but instead, decided to jump out a window to his  death.<br />A key factor that made this book enjoyable was the style in which  its monologue was written.  This book is definitely not an English  teacher's dream when it comes to grammar, sentence structure, etc.  But the  dialect, risqué even by today's standards, conveys a feeling of reality  that is not obtainable by any other literary device I know of.  Holden's  sarcasm, humorous attitude, and flat out bluntness had me laughing page  after page.  This line, chosen at random, demonstrates Holden's attitude  and dialect, \\""You should've seen the way they said hello.  You'd have  thought they hadn't seen each other in twenty years.  You'd have thought  they'd taken baths in the same bathtub or something when they were little  kids.  Old buddyroos.  It was nauseating.  The funny part was, they  probably met each other just once, at some phony party.  Finally, when they  were all done slobbering around, old Sally introduced me.\\""  <br />So why is A  Catcher in the Rye a great book?  I think what makes a great book great is  its ability to communicate with the reader.  Every teenager I know can  easily relate to Holden Caulfield's situation.  The book is a comfort if  you're a teen feeling the same things as Holden, criticizing the world and  its occupants.  Holden Caulfield is a hero that wasn't afraid to speak his  mind.  He taught me that your criticisms of the world are not invalid, and  that there is nothingthat you can say that is so bad that you have to  repress it.  Holden made me feel a little less alone.  He made me feel like  there were others in this predicament that we call adolescence.",2000-06-02

Since he did not want his parents to know he failed  all of his subjects except English, he detours and spends three days in New  York hotel.   While in a cab, he strikes  up a conversation with the  driver. Then Houlden pops the question that follows him throughout all his  cab rides. &quot;You know those ducks in that lagoon right near Central  Park South? That little lake? By any chance, do you know where they go, the  ducks, when it gets all frozen over? Do you happen to know by any  chance?&quot;(page 60).  The driver could not tell him. But he knew what  happened to the fish... they get frozen under water.  It puzzled me that the  driver could not tell Houlden the answer. Then I learned  that the ducks  were a symbol for something else in his life. Houlden used to have a  brother Allie, but he died of leukemia. Houlden is sort of an atheist so he  does not believe much in G-d. If there is no G-d, there is no heaven for  him, either.  Houlden still thinks about him often. It makes Houlden wonder  where Allie is.  The ducks are a metaphor for Allie. Houlden wants to know  where did Allie really go.  Catcher in the Rye is a good story for  teens to read. I felt as though I could I relate to some of the situations.  J.D. Salinger  did an excellent job of looking through a teenager's eyes at  the surrounding world. The &quot;goddamns&quot; gave that real teen  approach, but I think it was a little overdone. This book was written in  the fifties, and it's nice to that some things  about teens will never  change. I found the last chapter of the book to be rather confusing. In its  shortness, you have to read carefully to notice the details that tell his  fate about his breakdown. Houlden drops small clues about his psychological  problem as the book develops. Breaking all the windows of the car with his  bare hands after Allie dies would be one of the signs. Houlden doesn't tend  to interact with others well. At his last school, Pency, we know he doesn't  get along with Stradlater, Ackley or any of his classmates. He doesn't get  along with Sally, either. There are, although, some people he gets along  with... Jane, Allie, Phoebe, the nuns at the restaurant.   The tone of  the story is depressed. To me, it seems more clearly stated than in most  books.  Everything  about Houlden is depressed, except at the end when he's  watching Phoebe on the carousel. Houlden was a rather flat character, or  didn't change much throughout the length of the novel.",2000-06-02

His  use of constant profanity enhances the books realism and the ability for  identification with other teen-agers.  The fact he did not wish to obey the  bounds of society helped me understand I was not alone in my struggle  against authority. Its ending morale is very inspiring and illustrates a  change that occurs in your life when you begin to take a different  perspective. I also thought the elusive title's meaning was very profound  once realized and clinched my liking of the book.  It has a very positive  message in the end, which is able to be conveyed through the controversy  the book exhibits. The book also has an outer political war it wages for  the first amendment. I feel that the books paradox, the fact it is a  quality piece of literature while using some vulgarity to convey the idea,  strikes a blow for the freedom of speech. The overwhelming honesty and  frankness of the book with its profanity, which illustrates its reality,  denounce the view of those who feel their morals are being violated by  freedom of speech.   I do have some problems with the book and Holden's  behavior and viewpoints. The book is very slow in the beginning and  actually throughout its duration. Its pace is awkward because Holden is  always reassuring us in small sentences like, \\"" I really did.\\"" He also  calls many people \\""phony\\"", and when you begin to understand his  perspective, he becomes hypocritical and \\""phony\\"" himself. This makes Holden  less credible in conveying ideas to you, which may be Salinger's intent.   I also thought that the character of Phoebe played an important role in how  one perceived the book. Phoebe was the metaphorical child by the  metaphorical cliff that Holden must metaphorically catch. This was actually  very significant because by Holden saving his little sister from his  lifestyle, he also saved himself. This gave the most positive outlook on  the book, by showing salvation was possible at any juncture of your life. I  liked the idea that the unruly Holden could still have enough clarity to  see what he was doing was wrong and he should not want to inflict it on one  he cares about. Holden's Yang type quality gives him a seductive aspect  while allowing him to teach a powerful lesson, which is why the book is so  appealing to me and other adolescents.",2000-06-02

The main character, a sixteen  year old boy named Holden Caulfield, gets kicked out of a Prep school and  spends most of the book wondering the streets of New York making  observations in his head.  He goes through many different character stages  during the novel.  In the beginning, he seems like a normal, practical kid  who does not get good grades in school.  After he is expelled from school,  he gives in to increasing feelings of loneliness and misery.  He begins to  think about people he used to know, his dead brother Allie, his sister  Phoebe, old girlfriend Jane Gallagher, and friend Sally Hayes. He ends  up spending time with Jane and then sneaking into his house to see Phoebe.   I will not ruin the rest of the story, but many things happen to Holden  that seem weird and irrelevant while reading the novel.  Overall, I  think this was a good story.  Like I said, I was confused while I was  reading, but I was able to put the pieces together after I finished the  novel.  I think J.D. Salinger wrote this story very well.  The writing was  intriguing and interesting.  It was not one of those books that I could not  put down, but whenever I had some spare time, I wanted to read it.  It had  a style much different that any book that I have ever read.  I kept waiting  for something exciting to happen, but it never did.  My interest in Holden  is what kept me into the book.  I found the way his mind worked to be  fascinating.  Whenever he got a thought in his head, he acted on it.  It  was this impulsiveness that often got him in trouble.  I do have some  criticisms, though. Even though it was well written I think there should  have been a better plot and more themes to make the story more interesting.   I also have some questions as to Holden's character.  I do not think the  reasons for his bizarre actions were explained well enough.  At one point  in the story, Phoebe asked him to come up with one thing that he liked a  lot.  He was such a pessimist that he could not think of anything at first.   He finally thought up a wild scenario that he said he would like.  He said  that he would like to stand on the edge of a cliff that had a rye field on  it.  The field would have children playing on it and he would catch them if  they started to fall off the cliff.  He would be a `catcher in the rye'.   That was the only thing that he could dream up that he liked.  As you  can see, I have a few criticisms, but I found this book to be very  enjoyable.  In general, I thought The Catcher in the Rye was a good novel  and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a book to read.",2000-06-02

Salinger is a timeless classic in which a young boy tries to find himself while living in his Ivy League world. The young hero of the book, Holden Caufield, tries to reestablish a  relationship with his younger sister, and decide what he wants to make of  him self. <br /> Holden has been expelled from Pencey for academic  failure, and after an unpleasant evening with his self-satisfied roommate  Stadlater and their pimply next-door neighbor Ackley, he decides to leave  Pencey for good and spend a few days alone in New York City before  returning to his parents' Manhattan apartment.<br /> Upon reading The  Catcher in the Rye I had high expectations.

It seems to me that the only audience that truly appreciates this magnificent  piece is the high school kid.  My reasoning behind this is because the  story is basically an account of a teenage guy's eventful and emotional  life - rather four days of it.  The content of these four days in New York  more than makes up for rather short time span of the novel.  Holden Vitamin  Caulfield, as he likes to call himself, is constantly being bombarded with  psycological pressures.  His overwhelming concern revolves around the  existence of &quot;phonies&quot; as he so calls them, who limit the ideas  of the adolescent and try to get in the way of Holden's voyage to another  realm, free of corruption and media.  Holden searches for a world devoid of  the limits of his adolescent years.  Holden never really does encounter any  physical dangers in his journey to find himself, instead he feels  threatened by the majority and contemporary mass cluture, which promote the  loss of individuality, ancient accepted values, and intellectual awareness.   A plot summary of The Catcher is a very tedious task indeed.  The strucure  of it could be associated with a patient's recollection of past events to  psychiatrist.  Even so, the actual plot is not the most important thing  about this book.  What is important are the characters and their  philosophies.  Many adults may criticize Holden and his rough language, but  us teenagers wolud just flock to Holden if he were an actual person.   Holden also carries with him his trusty red hunting hat, a symbol of his  protection and sense of self.  Holden also makes several remarks about the  ducks on the lagoon of Central Park South.  He wonders where they go when  winter comes along.  One can think of this as a VERY extended metaphor  comparing Holden himself looking for a new place to settle to the ducksof  Central Park.  My recommendation is that if you are a teenager who has a  touch on reality and would just love to hear other accounts and insights on  life from a similar perspective, then this book is a MUST for you!  If you  are a little older perhaps and you think that all this is nonsense, then  this novel is even more of a MUST for you.  It is a must for anybody!   Still, I honestlythink that my fellow teenagers will get more of a kick out  of this book.  Even my very own English teacher remarked that Catcher made  more of an impact the first time she read it, of course when she was a  female Holden, herself, a normal teenager just looking for complete  ecstacy, including love, friends, and true family.  Salinger also presents  Holden's tale through very delicate symbols, including his hat, the rain,  and even suitcases.  Its better and more fulfilling for you to see these  for yourself.  Also, be prepared for constant exaggeration, complete  oxymorons, and swearing because after all, this is a true representation of  the maturing youth.  If one is so superficial to simply not read this  because of the choice of words, then i pity him, for he has completely  missed the point that Salinger was trying to make, and he has missed out on  truly one of the best books ever to be written.",2000-05-13

I do read a lot (because I have to), and so far J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye is by far the best  book I've ever read.  In writing this book, Salinger surpassed Hemmingway,  Hawthorne, and all the other \\""great writers.\\""<br />Catcher is the story of  Holden Caulfield, a selfish, hypocritical, and troubled teenager who has  been kicked out of a private high school just before Christmas vacation.  Like any teenager, he isn't eager to tell his parents that he's been kicked  out of school, so he leaves his dorm and wanders around New York trying to  find himself.  The book follows Holden and his encounters in the Big Apple.   He drinks in bars, solicits a prostitute, and does many other things that  some boys at that age often think about, but lack the means and the cajones  to actually do.  Holden is troubled about the fact that he is growing up.   He does not want to become older and sees his maturation as a transition  from the real and personal world of being young to the phony, impersonal  word of the older generation.<br />I enjoyed this novel because Salinger  amazingly writes the dialogue of Holden to resemble that a real immature  pre-adult.  He also did not shy away from including profanity and risqué  subject matter.  Salinger also writes in a style which, as I have noticed  over the past couple years, many of the great American novelists lack.   It's called PLAIN ENGLISH.  There is not any complicated dialogue,  confusing metaphors, or any hidden meaning.  When Salinger has a message,  he says it straight out.  Salinger's The Catcher In The Rye is a well  written novel.<br />Any living, breathing, human with at least half a pulse  would enjoy this novel at least for the story itself.

Well honestly I would have made it 3 1/2 if that justifies it.  The reason why it didn't get the standard amazon.com ranking of 5 stars is because it just did not seem profound enough or motivating  enough to get anymore.  I was always jealous of not being able to read this  in high school (for some reason it was not required) and I made a point of  reading it someday (afterall this book was voted the best book by high  school seniors this year in Illinois.)<br />Salinger did a wonderful job  writing in a first person adolescent style speech, and the character  desiring to be the 'catcher in the rye' seemed ironic.  Nevertheless, I  finished the book shrugging my shoulders and thinking 'what was the point?'  It was well written, but I am not sure why it was voted as the best book  by high schoolers - if any book should have had that honor I would think it  would have been Harper Lee's book, To Kill a Mockingbird - which was also  simply written but definitely felt more profound than this.  Holden  Caulfield is a typical cynical teenager that really has a hard time dealing  with the senselessness of humanity.  Nevertheless, I just didn't have any  feelings toward the book afterward and it didn't feel as profound as many  other reviewers felt it was.<br />I think everyone should read the book, but  if you're over the age of 18, I think you'll find yourself saying - I wish  I would have read this a few years ago because I feel I have outgrown the  attitudes that Holden expresses.

I am a high school student and read The Catcher for an English  assignment.  I have to say that I really enjoyed the novel.  I actually  read the book &quot;cover to cover&quot;.  I bore through Arms of the Man  and Scarlet Letter.  Note: (   ), I really enjoyed The Great Gatsby  (There are some brownie points).<br />    The Catcher provided a style that  was realistic and complex.  Many find this difficult that Holden comments  on several situations at the same moment, but when you think about it, that  is exactly the way that humans function.  Come on, you can not tell me that  when you were talking to someone and never find yourself thinking about  that time when...  ANYWAY, The style and the graphic dialogue create a  dislike for the Catcher.  When people found out that I chose the Catcher,  they would say all this stuff about the language and how bad it was and how  they could only get through the first page.  After talking to all these  people I could have sworn I had the edited version.  The abrupt language  provided a break from the classic style and made the novel realistic.  Have  you ever seen Good Will Hunting? Any they are complaining about the  Catcher?<br />I will say that on the way through the novel that I skipped over  the symbolism/ extended metaphors and did not find any, but going back over  the symbolism is very coherent.  So you can find them, look for the  comparison of ducks on the frozen pond to Holden's personality frozen to  the world and the Catcher in the Rye saving the child from the cliff of  adulthood. (Just a little help.  These are not found in Cliff Notes.)<br />     I love Holden's character.  Holden is a gentleman at heart and does not  present himself as anything he is not.  He provides an interlude from the  society of &quot;phonies&quot;.  To Holden, phonies are everywhere.  A  phony is anyone who presents a different personality according to the  audience whom they are presented with.  Being a phony is typically an adult  trait.  Please do not get bitter on me, but let me explain.  It is  typically an adult trait, because the child idealism does not include the  need to impress people.  Holden engulfs himself in the ideal of innocence  mostly found in children especially Holden's younger siblings and Jane whom  he places on an angelic pedestal.  Holden explains that such innocence can  be discovered in adults through his example of the drummer.  Holden admires  the drummer, because the drummer's job consists of a few miniscule notes  and the drummer never bores and plays every performance with pride.  Holden  finds honor in the drummer.<br />    Holden provides an extraordinary  character and a change in pace from the American literature found on the  English department bookshelf.  I fell in love with Holden and by the end I  felt like I really knew him.  By the end, I felt sorry for him and all I  wanted to do was to give Holden the gift of a really good friend and a fake  ID.        If you enjoy more psychological kind of novels and preferably on  the younger side, because of the subject matter (and plus if our parents  knew how we think then what would we do then?) then The Catcher in the Rye  is a good bet.  If you like the action packed thrills then save your money.  (   )Nuff said.",2000-05-07

Salinger, took place in the 1940's (though it's story could have taken place today, or at any other time, for that matter) in New York City.  The main character is Holden Caulfield, the  narrator and a bad student.  Holden is quite intelligent but lets his  talents go to waste by not doing school work or anything else he felt like.  He is awfully stubbborn, and brutally honest, and I didn't really like his  characteristics very much, even though they were very much like how real  people act.  The book was odd because there seemed to be little plot.  The  story starts when Holden Caulfield gets expelled from his exclusive--and  expensive--school.  The rest of the book tells of Holden and his excitement  through New York over a period of several days with almost no plot.  Pretty  boring, right?  Not neccessarily.  The book was not about plot, it was  about exploring characters, especially Holden.  But there were a mob of  others.  Most characters were just in for a few pages, and then were gone.  Those types of characters include: Mr. Spencer, a teacher; Ackley and  Stradlater, annoying roommates; Jane, his crush; Mrs. Morrow, the mother of  someone he knew; three ugly girls Holden danced with; Sunny, a prostitude;  two Catholic nuns; and numerous others.<br />But Holden was still the majot  character.  I really didn't like him that well.  I liked most of the other  characters, though, especially Phoebe, his clever sister.  One reason I  didn't like him was his reinforcing everything he said.  Also, cursing in a  book is an okay thing, but this book goes to some extremes.  Don't refuse  to buy it on account of that, because it's still a good book, just Holden's  cussing can be a distraction.  And even though I didn't like Holden's  personality as a character, he was the best person to narrate the book.  The book was very good with a lot of hidden meaning.

His negativity is brought  forth by an intense focus upon other people's lives and the reactions they  get from others in the world.  Salinger allows Caufield to talk about  life's most important topics in a not so serious manner.  At first I had  this sense of feeling that Holden was very insecure with himself which made  him believe everyone around him had a fake personna, but towards the end of  the book I realized that he actually had other people's best interests at  heart.

I like the scenes and the way  J.D. Salinger used the language in the discussions. However the plot was  too hard to understand by anyone let alone a 10th grader.

I know that I am far more cynical than Holden ever was, and  don't hold the author (Salinger) in the highest esteem.  I believe  Salinger has been afraid to come out of his self-imposed exile because he  knows he will never find another voice as authentic as Holden's.  I had  a friend in San Francisco who absolutely insisted that Salinger and Pynchon  were the same person. I guess it makes a certain amount of sense in an  Oliver Stone kind of way.

In this age of  shallow films and pulp Stephen Kingesque fiction, people seem more  concerned with cheap, &quot;action-packed&quot; thrills, and (not to sound  like Holden or anything) it is depressing to see that people are unable to  be moved by a book unless it involves a homicidal clown or a rebellious  Soviet submarine. In response to those who feel that Holden is just a  mindless cynic, I feel as if you have failed to see what lied beneath his  very blunt (though often true) observations of the numerous rituals that  are plentiful in American society. After finishing the book, Holden did not  seem to be a cynic, but rather a figure of both youthful desperation and  enlightened sympathy. He was by no means just an ass for he saw beauty  in such innocent things as his little sister's joy while riding a carousel  and the strange excitement felt by a humble drummer as he prepares to play  a few, almost meaningless notes, and reflecting upon such things, one is  lead to the belief that Holden, deep within his heart, wishes not to merely  criticize but to help others by showing them the pointless suffering caused  by their own arrogance (a self-glorifying form of cynicism) and  self-centered attitudes. Thus, it can be concluded that it is not Holden  who is insane, but the world itself. Holden sees through their insanity,  and criticizes the disease, not the diseased.",2000-04-26

First you have to understand Salinger writes most  of his stories like a puzzle and its up to the reader to figure it out. If  you take the book at face value all you get is a confusing mess about a  teen age boy. If you dig a little beneath the surface you find the story of  a boy coming to terms with adulthood and growing up. His little sister  Phoebe is the childhood essence, his dead brother Allie symbolizes never  growing old, and Being a catcher in the rye is his desire to save children  from the pains of adulthood. It does a good job of explaining a teenagers  view of the adult life and childhood and the pain of being stuck in  between. as for the story being depressing, if you realise that Holden, the  main character, is happy in the end, willing to grow up, youd see its not  depressive. As for those who says he just needs help and they couldnt  relate, perhaps they should have read it when they were 16 or perhaps they  should read it again.

He can no  longer stand his confusion about what lies ahead in his future.  Salinger  offers many hints and symbols about the boy's confusion, even in his choice  of drink- whiskey, an older man's drink, with soda, for the child in him.   The title is &quot;Cather in the Rye&quot; because of the unreal profession  Holden wants to occupy when he is older.  This imaginary job is preventing  children from falling off a cliff.  The symbolism in this is that Holden  really wants to prevent younger children from falling into the phoniness of  teenage society and its cliques, modern day examples being wiggas, skaters,  athletes, losers, etc. He wants all the children to be protected from the  problems he faces.  This story helped me out much when I read it only a  couple of months ago, and his hopes of protecting children from falling  into the phoniness of teenageism are fulfilled whenever someone, who is at  the right age, reads this teriffic novel.

He moves from one topic to  another and back to the first several times throughout the story.  I'd  rather him stick to the point and maybe get to his subtopics a little  later.

Some people even tell me that they are in love with Holden Caulfield, but that's another story...  I had to read a book of my choice for my English class.  I chose The Catcher in the Rye because I  had heard so many great things about this book from movies and people.   After only ONE page I became bored with this book.  I don't like how Holden  always begins to think about something else when he is already thinking of  something.  For example, on the second page he keeps talking about being at  the football game and then starts to think about past games for no apparent  reason.  The profanity in the book was not that much of a bother to me.    The only reason someone should ever want to read this book is if they have  to do it for an English assignment or for their job.  I rate this book with  a star because of its poor story, and boring style.

I'm normally not one to htink about a book even when I'm not reading it, but with Salinger's THE CATCHER IN THE RYE, that is not true.  I found myself constantly thinking about Holden and trying to comprehend his emotions and feelings.  He is very confused and tired of everyone's phoniness.

I'd heard many allusions to the book, and many people said they liked it, yet I didn't really know what it was about.  It is fascinating, a true inspiration.   Holden is so complex that you can't stop thinking about him when you're not  reading.  Salinger's amazing insights into human nature and his clever  style of cynicism  is unique to much of literature and better than all  contemporary literature.  As Holden starts to spiral down, you can't help  but feel incredibly sad thinking about his situation.  A boy, on the brink  of breakdown, speaking of things that make so much sense.  It makes you  wonder if he's the one going crazy or if it's the way society is that is  truly crazy.  I will always love this book and I plan on going over it  again to underline all the lines that I adored.  For the people giving bad  reviews, and as I've analyzed their comments, I must say that you missed  the boat.  I'm sure that you are the people that Holden is making his  social critiques on.  No symbolism, a boring character that is whining?   Come again?  Salinger's phrasing of his words is simplistic, but his  message is not.

Salinger's \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" when I had to read it in high school. I thought main character Holden Caulfield could have been killed off in the first chapter, and it would have made for a better  story.<br />The book takes place over a weekend in the life of Holden, a  perennial dropout in virtually anything he does. He gets kicked out of the  latest in a string of colleges in the beginning, so he heads home, for New  York City.<br />Once in the Big Apple, Holden looks up old girlfriends, visits  a prostitute (and winds up haggling over the price), is reunited with his  beloved sister Phoebe and does a host of other stuff one typically does  over a weekend or when one has been thrown out of college and doesn't want  one's parents to know.<br />The entire story is told from Holden's point of  view, and in a stream of consciousness that bounces from one subject to  another at random. The character ruminates on where the ducks in Central  Park go in the winter, his roommate's clipping of toenails and sex.<br />He  also has developed the incredibly annoying habit of saying something, then  reiterating it as if his audience does not believe him. He really does, I  swear to God. After a while, classic or not, defining character trait or  not, you want to smack him. You really do. But that was really the only  left-over hostility I felt for what many consider to be the Great American  Novel.<br />Maybe it's because Holden is now a fellow college student, and I  can commiserate with him when people drop into his room unannounced or are  obnoxious.<br />Maybe it's because I have grown into a very random thought  pattern myself, so I no longer find the subject jumps to be quite so  annoying.<br />It could be because young Master Caulfield is a cynic, and I am  an individual who celebrates cynicism and sarcasm, as these are  characteristics which seem to be even more the rage today than they were in  the '50s.<br />Or could it be because there's still such afervor over  \\""Catcher,\\"" even though it was originally published in 1951. And while we're  at it, exactly WHY is there such a fervor over the book?<br />Is it because  Salinger, after completion and publication, slipped away from the American  public and became a recluse, writing (or so we think) in the comfort of his  own home behind a great wall of silence?<br />Would we still like the story if  J.D. Salinger were the century's Stephen King, pumping out novel after  novel after novel, and \\""The Catcher in the Rye\\"" was just the book between  \\""Franny and Zooey\\"" and \\""Hapworth 16, 1924\\""?<br />Would we still applaud if  Holden Caulfield were the adolescent cynic created by a one-time author  named Milton Nosepicker?<br />Or does the story transcend its author, his  seclusion or the fervor around it?

First of all, the  issue of teenage angst is a difficult one to depict in words. It is a  difficult one to depict without actually being a teen. Most of the  depictions of teenage life these days are rather exploitative. They mostly  tell teens how to behave and do not show the true side of adolescence. To  those readers who complain that Holden is an &quot;immature  malcontent&quot; and so on, teenagers are often immature and often are  malcontents. If Salinger led you to believe that Holden is an immature  malcontent, then his mission was accomplished. At the current age of 17, I  can relate to Holden's character moreso than any other teenager depicted in  the media. Although Salinger's style of writing is a little too elementary  to be called a &quot;classic,&quot; I feel that Holden Caulfield should be  the model for teens. Here we have a character who hates change and wants to  be a &quot;catcher in the rye.&quot; When I see children shooting each  other, I feel that this is a noble goal for anyone to have. While you are  entitled to your opinion, keep in mind that if the world were full of  Holden's &quot;phonies&quot; it would be a conformist nightmare. Thank god  for people like Holden.",2000-03-13

Salinger writes a novel of Holden¡¯s life in the book called The Catcher in the Rye. The novel is fiction with a form of the first person view. The style of this book is very descriptive in fact. The basic outline of the story is about the freedom the main character, Holden Caulfield, wants, and how he wants to be someone who has meaning. Holden has basically been expelled from many schools. And yet, he is staying at Pencey (school). Well, Holden tries to stay tight in Pencey, but it seems like he cannot stand his life in the dormitory. Eventually, he sneaks out of Pencey after having a fist fight with his roommate, a few days before the vacation, and hangs around on the streets of New York, while visiting his loving sister Pheobe and friends from time to time. And basically everything else in between the main parts, are just very deep descriptions of his memories.  Through the story, you will find many problems with Holden and his friends having fist fights, and problems within the society and Holden, where Holden hangs out in night clubs looking for girls to hang around with, and places such as the hotel room he stays in. There are a tremendous number of conflicts in the book, which makes it interesting to read.  If you look at the book and think back of the story, you do not really feel that it has any point to it. You would start to wonder why Holden ever even went to a dormitory if he didn¡¯t like it. I mean, all the book talks about is Holden¡¯s pathetic life, and what he goes through at every place. I am sure the book was a story, but I did not find any point in the book. There wasn¡¯t a direct thought of what the book was about after I had finished the book. Even though the format of the story was not quite what I thought, I still think that the book was put a lot of thinking in it. Out all the books Ihave read in my life, this book is quite different in a way. One of the books I read before was called Death Be Not Proud by John Gunther, which was about a little boy who had cancer and died, it was a quite depressing biography of a little boy. The reason I am comparing it the with The Catcher in the Rye is because, it only describes basic thoughts in a regular way, but The Catcher in the Rye takes every event and deeply describes every bit of it. Not only that but also some subjects the main character, Holden Caulfield, talks about leads to other things in his life that relates to it. So, it is like branches on a tree, one leading to another. I found that confusing for me, because while I was reading the book, I did not know what to focus on, so that I can comprehend. On the other hand, I slightly did find it interesting for me to read in a way.  While I was reading through, I seemed to have enjoyed the deep descriptions of Holden¡¯s life, but one thing I seriously did not really enjoy reading in every other sentence, were the curse words the author slipped in. Every other sentence of this book had curse words slipped in to them. I found that part inappropriate for young readers to read. Over all, I think the author put a load of thought into every paragraph of the book, but I don¡¯t think he mainly focused on the format of the book. Because, if you read through the book, you seem to enjoy it with much interest since it is really descriptive, but once you finish it, you ask yourself, what was the point? I mean, the plot and setting was all great, but what about the ending? The Catcher in the Rye does not seem to leave a memorable thought to the reader. If the author would have put a little more effort on the basic format of the story with reasoning, I think the book would have been one of my favorite books. It seems like the author enjoyed describing every thought of the book with much effort and time. I recommend The Catcher in the Rye to high school students with a book rating of eight out of ten.",2000-02-03

Holden possesses a quality that every human being can relate to- be it rage, fear, love, or the need to protect everyone from everything-  including themselves. Holden needs love, and he strives to preserve  innocence. He feels he has to be the savior- a catcher in the rye. The  Catcher in the Rye addresses many issues. It is a commentary on the  insensitivity of modern society. Holden is a hero who stands against the  hypocrisy that almost all others accept. As much as he would like to accept  the world and be comfortable like almost everyone else, he can't pretend  that his society is worthwhile. The novel is about a boy who struggles to  remain faithful to what he sees as the truth. His version of truth,  however, is very subjective, and not necessarily correct. In his mind even  good or beautiful things can be tainted because of the true motives of  their creators. But primarily, this is a novel about a disturbed teenager  who refuses to grow up, and let go. He has a fixation on childhood, which  shows itself in his glorifying of children, his inordinate admiration of  his younger sister, his idealization of his dead younger brother, and the  joy he gets from reminiscing about his own childhood. He brings on his  illness so he won't have to face his approaching adulthood.

Holden is a  seventeen-year-old high school student, but he is not your average teen.   Holden has had much trouble in school.  He has already been kicked out of  two schools and now another for excessive bad grades.  Holden is stressed  from roommates in his dorm and what his parents will say to him when they  find out he has been kicked out of Pencey High School.  Holden, on the  other hand, seems to be the type of person who doesn't care what people  think of him.  This made him very enjoyable to read about because he  relates to the way I feel personally.  Holden then decides to leave Pencey  and go to New York to lay low for a couple of days until his parents find  out what he had done and give them time to cool off.  In New York, Holden  gets a hotel room and is stressed from rude people in the big city and is  depressed because he feels lonesome.  He begins missing his sister Phoebe.   He goes to see her at night but doesn't want to confront his parents so he  wants to leave after visiting his sister.  When he sees her and decides to  leave Phoebe wants to go with him.  Holden gets very upset arguing with her  and breaks down.  Holden couldn't take any more of the pressure and Holden  suffers a bad thing.  You have to read it to find out what it is.

The people who gave the book one star I can understand: they haven't &quot;gotten it&quot; yet and will  probably need to reread it five to ten fifteen years down the road. Those  who criticized the swearing, to you I say get a life.  Criticizing The  Catcher in the Rye for its use of profanity is like saying the Godfather  should not be shown because of the violence: the profanity used is part of  Holden's diction; it reveals more about him as a character than merely what  he thinks about something.  If you have a problem reading books with  profanity, then many 20th century classics must bother you.  For those out  there who gave TCITR five stars but went off on its perfect portrayal of  teenage angst, I question whether the book itself or the reputation  preceding the book influenced your review.  I am a 16 year old female who  just finished the book for an advanced english 11 class. I do not consider  myself cynical, have never drank, smoked, run away, or considered hiring a  prostitute, yet I find this book THE most influential book I have ever  read.  Holden's perception of the world as a bunch of phonies is more  dead-on than most people would care to believe.  I don't see angst the  driving force as much as growing up (or lack thereof).  Whether you can  relate to this book or not, it is an important read if only to see the  world perspective from someone other than yourself.  Although I am not an  adult yet, it's been my observation that as adults get older, they dislodge  more and more from the person they were as a teenager; a reasonable and  natural progression.  However, when these same adults have children, they  are so out of touch with being a teenager that they cannot relate, and  therefore write off teenagers as troublemakers.  Teenagers haven't changed  as much as adults have.  While this diatribe will undoubtably offend many  people, andI will probably be written off as a teenager who does not  understand the world as a whole, I would like to say that I stand by my  opinions and wrote this review because I saw a void in the other reviews.

I have to say that all the people(or should I say kids) who gave the book one star, were obviously  not old enough, or wise enough, to have any perspective on this book. The  common complaints were:<br />1. I did not relate to the book, and do not  understand why people think teemagers are like Holden. Therefor, because I  did not relate to the book, I think that you should not waste your time  reading it, because obviously, if I didn't relate to it, you won't either.  <br />2. It had no plot/character develpoment/conlict, and was boring  therefor<br />3. I didn't understand it<br />My response: <br />1.You don't have to  be exactly like Holden to understand where he's coming form. The book was  written showing the glimpses of most adolescents minds, the tumult, that  doesn't come as fully as it did in Holden, but is there none the less. The  author projected teens(and all peoples) little struggles onto a whole life.  That is why it is so satisfying for us to read, it gives our feelings  validation. Also an outlet reading this book, for our &quot;Holden-like  emotions&quot; to flow through us, and not remain squished up in our  heads.Everyone has dysfunctional emotions, and you are keeping them all  squished up, and therefore rendering yourself spurious, if you do not ever  feel them. I do not imply, that everyone is dysfuntional(quite the  opposite), but only that we all at one time or another, and especially in  our teen years, struggle with life, and our attitude towards  society.<br />2.Although the book had little plot, that is not the point of  all books. If the book had been more story like, it would not have rung as  true, as nobody's life, especially just 3 or 4 days of it, has a definite  plot. And, yes, the book DID have character development, not in the  traditional sense, but the author highlighted a short period of Holden's  life, in which he went through a transformation. <br />3. Please read it again  in ten years or so, when you have had more experience of life, you will  then understand it.<br />I won't tell everyone to read it because I loved it,  but I will say, that you should read it, because it will describe your  attitude towards life, based on your reaction to it. If you are a teenager,  read it now, but read it again when you are older, whether you liked it or  not when you first read it, you will understand much more.",1999-09-17

I didn't want to grow up, but stay a kid as long as I possibly  could.  At first, I was able to relate to young Holden and his lack of  maturation.  Then, after about fifty or so pages, I realized that Holden is  too childish.  Salinger does not succesfuly create a simpathetic character.   In fact, Holden's repetitive ranting and raving over male-female sexual  relations led me to lunacy.  I was in tears, pulling out my hair.  If I was  reading this book for pleasure, and not for a class assignment, I would  have thrown it out the window.

People who wish to  be classified as &quot;free thinkers&quot; for the sake of social status  swoon over this book in an embarrassing, lemming-like manner.

The Catcher in the Rye is about  the everyboy, the everyteenager. Anyone who has searched for his identity  and his place in the world can relate to the story. Holden Caulfield  embodies the idiotic, impulsive, emotional teenager. Salinger didn't write  a character, he held a mirror to an American archetype.

The scene with the  prostitute, making fun of Ackley behind his back--they're all emotions and  feelings that are, in some respect, universal to all human beings, but  mostly the sort of things we are too proud to speak about.

Holden reflected upon his escapades  through his clouded, obstructed outlook on the events which took place  during adolescence.  Gene Forrester reminisced, also in the first person,  about the trials and tribulations of his high school relationships.  An  outsider, looking in upon the daily shenanigans of Randall McMurphy in a  psychiatric ward of an urban hospital, told the third literary work from  omniscient third person point of view. Thus, the way an author expressed  point of view was crucial to the understanding of the characteristics of  the protagonist, the way he related to others, and the main character's  developmental maturity at the end of the work.  The similitude of the  protagonists' traits in these three literary works was strikingly  synonymous although they were told from dissimilar viewpoints.  Salinger  allowed Holden's sub-conscious and conscious thoughts to permeate his pages  while keeping the interference between thought and reality a distinct  dichotomy.  Holden's reactions to adversity also illustrated his strengths  and weaknesses in dealing with his peers.  Holden was an introvert, except  in confrontations, where he would turn into a verbose, overzealous  authority on the topic at hand.  Holden responded with rage when his  roommate denounced the quality of an essay he had written.  &quot;What the  hell's the difference if it's about a baseball glove?&quot; (Catcher p. 41)   He then proceeded to tear up hours of hard work due to frustration.   Randall McMurphy's eccentric attitudes and constant rebellions were  demonstrated by Kesey's narrator in a purely physical form.  We were  unaware of the psychological processes occurring in his mind.  McMurphy was  thought to be lacking full faculty and reasoning, but perhaps had the story  been told in first person, we could have gained a better understanding of  his modus operandi and motivations for his idiosyncratic actions.  Gene's  value system established by Knowles was disclosed by Gene himself.  We  would not have been able to understand Gene's deranged, ulterior motives,  had it not been for Gene telling the story.  His irrational actions and  lack of remorse obviated any other narrative interpretations.  All three  protagonists had outspoken personalities and were determined to use their  forceful volition to have their way at all costs.  The level on which  each protagonist related to his peers was evidenced by conversation,  physical interaction, and thoughts of the characters.  Holden's superior  attitude isolated himself from his peers.  He felt all people with common  activities such as sports or seeing movies were phony.  Holden's words  epitomized his negative thoughts of humanity while trotting down Pencey's  dormitory hallway during his final departure.  &quot;Sleep tight, ya  morons!&quot;  (Catcher p. 52)  It was McMurphy's solitary goal to have  Chief assimilate into the social circles of the psychiatry ward.   &quot;C'mon Chief, take the ball, take the ball, c'mon!&quot;  (Cuckoo's  Nest p. unknown)  Randall could be heard encouraging his companions during  exercise time.  He tried to better the lives of his fellow patients by  exposing them to the ways of the world during card games and basketball  matches he organized.  McMurphy was all for conformation, but  unfortunately, this belief clashed with the rules of the hospital.  He  rallied his peers voices together in a biased attempt to further his own  desires.  A fishing expedition involving the entire company of deranged men  was organized and executed under the authority McMurphy bestowed upon  himself.  Unlike Holden, McMurphy was a social extrovert, always including  others in his adventures.  No thoughts of McMurphy were expressed due to  the third person viewpoint of the novel.  Phineas and Gene were best  friends.  Gene was always cordial to his teachers and other students.  The  deep boyhood bond between these two compatriots was demonstrated by their  frequent outings to the river, beach, and late-night activities.  Gene's  jealousy of Finny's athletic abilities overtook his psyche and he was  compelled to put a damper on them by causing Finny to break his leg.  After  this event, Gene became more and more isolated and began his incorrigible  lying spree.  During an interrogation by his peers in the smoke room, Finny  was heard fibbing, &quot;Yes, huh, yes there was a small, a little  contretemps at the tree.&quot; (Separate Peace p. 82)  Gene's thoughts were  of truth and justice, but his actions rarely vindicated them.  In order to  understand a character's relationships with others, we must first be able  to rationalize their thoughts and belief system and put them into the  environment in which the character reacts with others.  The maturity and  worldly knowledge each character gained as a result of their experiences  are portrayed in a variety of ways.  Caulfield's acceptance of rules and  consequences demonstrated his growth in maturity.  The realization he came  to at the end of his escapades was that one's family is always there for  one, no matter what trouble one is in.  During strolls in Central Park, and  long, lonesome nights, the truth of Holden's heartache and cover-up came to  the surface.  Had this novel been written in third person, our insight into  Holden's aspirations would have been solely based upon his limited  conversations with his sister.  The acceptance and mutual respect of Nurse  Ratched surfaced during the end of McMurphy's life.  Randall's actions  indicated his acceptance of his fate and of others' conditions.  McMurphy  voiced his concerns to Chief, and through those conversations, we learned  of his adult like maturity.  Both Holden and Randall used their life  experiences as basis for future decisions.  Gene, unlike the former  protagonists, started out with a great deal of knowledge.  His maturity  level atrophied and he continued to partake in the same childish activities  such as cutting class and teasing as he did in years past.  As expressed in  first person during Gene's inner struggles, he did show emotional maturity  and remorse for actions he had completed.  Each character seemed to grow  and develop in stages, as we learned through their dialogue, actions, and  thoughts.  Therefore, the portrayal of the characteristics of the  protagonist, his relation to other characters, and the main character's  developmental maturity defend the fact that point of view was essential to  the understanding of Catcher In The Rye, A Separate Peace, and One Flew  Over The Cuckoo's Nest.  Qualities shared by the three protagonists were  portrayed differently, however the message remained the same.  Some other  habits they had in common were smoking and the love to be challenged and  debated.  Holden, Gene, and Randall all confided in someone, although they  expressed their companionship in distinctive ways customary to their  individual personality.  The stages of maturity each protagonist reached as  a direct result of their interaction with others demonstrated emotional and  psychological growth.  There are various ways to portray key elements in  literary works, but one must take into consideration that each point of  view has its specific benefits and drawbacks.",1998-12-09

He is a boring, up-scale version of the traditional juevenile delingquent who blames the rest of the world for his situation, rather than make any attempt to change it.  The problem is, Salinger does not give Holden the charisma or the inherent prudence necessary to be a genuine and successful smart ass. Holden's priviledged lifestyle and prep-school mentality also make it hard to believe that this kid has any idea of what he's talking about when he makes his vapid little comments on the human race.  Salinger makes the mistake of funneling very adult themes and attitudes through a 17-year-old spokesperson, and it is not a good fit.  Coming from the mouth of an adult, some of them could be insightful and appropriate, expressed as experience.  Coming from a teenager, they just comes off as&quot;I-don't-know-what-I'm-talking-about-angst.&quot;  Grow up Holden.  Experience life a little, and then you'll have the right to be taken seriously as a cynic. <br />As for its status as a &quot;calssic&quot;, this story is an amusing diversion that moves along at a fairly quick pace and provides better-than-average distraction.

I am a 17 year old high school student, and luckily I was not forced to endure reading this book as many of my classmates were this year.  I did however read it several years ago and did not like it one bit.  It was so bad I couldn't even finish the book.  I skimmed through the last few pages, hoping to find a ray of light, a glimmer of wisdom or some gem of knowledge that I had missed but found none what so ever.Recently I re-read parts of the book to see if I was missing something, but it was to no avail.       To put it simply, Holden is a punk.  People tell me that maybe I don't identify with the character, can't recognize his struggles or what he is going through.  I think part of the reason I didn't like this book is because I can identify with all of those things and can see Holdens' point of view better than he can.  All of these adults who say that this is such a great book probably do so because they have forgotten what teen-angst feels like, or never even felt it in the first place and want to pretend they have.  I have never met a teenager that has liked this book, and our English Honors class is very well read. The teachers, adults, and librarians will rave on and on about it, but only because they have forgotten a part of themselves in adulthood.  That feeling of imortality and hatred towards our parents which they say we all have (but none of us seem to notice).     This book didn't teach me anything. For all of its angst, dischours, and depression, it dosen't have a focus, a purpose, or anything to direct it all at. It just blindly throws rage at the world like it's free and will never run out. By the time your at the end you feel like saying &quot;So What?&quot;  Maybe that's what they want, but it's not anygood when that's already how you feel. Perhaps because I identify with Holdens' feelings so much I don't identify with him at all and despise him. In the end, Holden leaves so much anger and rage that it all becomes inadequate.!

I regret that those who attack the book have often done so on the grounds of its vulgarity.  That just devalues their argument.  The fact is that the book is lousy because it portrays as a hero a teenage kid who is nothing but a bitter, maladjusted punk.  He interprets courtesy as phoniness, and in fact assumes that anyone who doesn't immediately give him whatever he feels like having must be cruel, or a phony, or just generally subhuman.  This kid is supposed to be teaching us something about life?  About adolescence?  He's learning about himself?  He has no interest in any of that - he's interested only in what other people can do for him.  He is sensitive to nothing but his own feelings.

The consistency of Holden's voice, the contemporariness of it (except for the $4000 jaguar and a few other things, it could have been written now), the angst of a depressed adolescent. Holden's language shows his depression and, because of it, his skewed thinking.  It is clear that the loss of his younger brother years before had a tremendous impact on him, and continues to affect his relationships.  He is not the most likeable of characters, and I don't think he would be even if he were no longer depressed, but he captures the confusion and feelings of an adolescent beautifully.

I read this in the early 1960's and it was awful.  I never understood why so many people think this is a good book. This was on all the High School reading lists and I never anted to read it.  The preacher convinced my Mom to read this from the Church Library.  She was appalled and asked me to read it and tell her what I thought as a SR in High School.  While I was not as appalled and shocked as she was, I did not think it worth the time it took to read.  M y Mom was not a prude my any means and in fact quite liberal for her time.",2013-11-28

Holden lives in fictional Agerstown, Pennsylvania and attends Pencey Prep, an exclusive private school.  Failing every class, Holden will flunk out of Pencey next Wednesday.  Having to deal with awful grades, the untimely death of his younger brother, and the “phoniness” of adulthood, Holden leaves Pencey early and spends a day in New York.  In the city, Holden hears a child singing the song, Comin’ thro’ the Rye.  The song cheers him up and leaves a lasting impact on him.  He tells his younger sister, Phoebe, “I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in a big field of rye and all.  Thousands of little kids, and nobody’s around--nobody big, I mean--except me.  And I’m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff.  What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go off the cliff--I mean if they’re running and they don’t look where they’re going.  I have to come out from somewhere and catch them.  That’s all I’d do all day.  I’d just be the catcher in the rye and all.  I know it’s crazy, but that’s the only thing I’d really like to be.”  This passage emphasizes Holden’s desire to preserve a sense of childhood innocence that is inevitably lost when one reaches adulthood.<br /><br />Overall Catcher in the Rye is an excellent novel.  Its first-person-narrative lets us step into the world of Holden Caulfield seamlessly.  Still, one must admit that this book is confusing, risqué, and ultimately not for children.  I would recommend that everyone eighteen or older read this book, as it requires a sense of intelligence and maturity to understand.  Otherwise it is likely that its message will be lost entirely.",2013-10-15

I liked how the story was told from the thoughts of the main character, nothing was filtered, and it felt like a conversation in his head and less like dull narrative. The eBook itself had several typos, minor things that are annoying, but can be overlooked.",2013-08-01
