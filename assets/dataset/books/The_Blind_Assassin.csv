I read this book a few years ago and the tale still lingers. I purchased this copy for my niece, who loves magical tales. The book is somewhat difficult at the start, as there are multiple story lines. However, the tale is worth pursuing. A well written book that is not soon forgotten.	2015-01-04

The Blind Assassin.<br />Prepare yourself for 4 novels in one: the novel Atwood writes, the memoir the character Iris Chase writes, the roman a clef her sister has written, and the science fiction stories told by the male character.  As she approaches her death, Iris Chase looks back at her life lived in the shadow of her famous sister.  But her memoirs are a bold deception. Atwood's story can hardly be called a mystery novel, but a very real mystery develops regarding the real identity of the characters in her sister's posthumous novel.  Atwood doesn't make it easy for the reader to get into this book, but it is a masterpiece of storytelling, and the difficult early chapters hold all the answers.  A brilliant book, perfect for discussion groups.	2014-08-11

I will admit it, the artwork had me puzzled at first because wasn't this novel supposed to be a story within a story within a story all surrounding the 1920's-1950's and beyond with a cameo appearance of the Science Fiction genre? What an odd choice but it all makes sense now. Tucked inside toward the end of this novel there is a passage concerning the narrator and her wish to stare at herself in the mirror and try to see how others perceive her. This passage continues and finally describes a woman looking over her shoulder. When I closed The Blind Assassin in the late hours of the morning, I could not help but think of that passage, the woman on the cover and the connection to make your own opinion about appearances.<br /><br />Certainly The Blind Assassin could be studied and debated in many different ways. Was this a book about sisters and a unique bond that could be forged from tragedy and tradition? Was this a story of evolution but inevitable demise of one's life because of unsaid words (or forced words?) Or was this just a recollection of painful memories set to the backdrop of a hodgepodge of literary genres that seamlessly branched from one story into several? The Blind Assassin may be all of these; it is all how the reader wishes to perceive the narrator. But at the end all the narrator asks is for a listener and I hope any potential reader who has the patience is ready to read something I can only describe and leaves the impression as being truly unique.<br /><br />In the end, The Blind Assassin certainly stands out as something unique. The writing was beautiful and captured this reader right from &#34;Ten days after the war ended, my sister Laura drove a car off a bridge.&#34; After stating this, the story spread out and split from one story into several and dropped this reviewer into so many worlds and brought so many entities to life.

A fascinating book and it is not difficult to see why Atwood was awarded the Booker Prize for The Blind Assassin. I look forward to reading it again although not just yet. A story creeping like a spider: spinning an eerie web with an intricately woven twist like a quadruple helix: on many levels and throughout the book. It shows the imagination and versatility of the writer. Atwood's ability to mix it up: soothing, serene and then swoosh from the turmoil and once again she poetically draws you back to the ebb and flow of the main theme. Leaving you to question what is the main theme in this parallel, parallel universe of a story.<br /><br />I like Iris - I think she's a gutsy although sad character. That is Iris as Atwood wished to portray her. Iris's concept of revenge, a dish best served cold, is indeed cold comfort for all, I believe. Reading some reviews - it's as though the same book has not been read... perception. I have taken on board the recommendations given for Atwood's other books.<br /><br />I bought this second hand as a paperback at a curiosity shop for $1 (bargain!) and I bought the Kindle version from Amazon. I love both versions of the book.	2013-05-01

Atwood provides a solid ending.    Cons:  The book is simply too long for the content.  The same story could easily have been told in 300+ pages rather than 500+ pages.  Atwood's prose reminds me of Kazuo Ishiguro, but Atwood lacks Ishiguro's ability to keep a tight narrative.  In a more compelling story, like The Handmaid's Tale, one can overlook Atwood's trouble with pacing, but the story here is weaker and the narrative plods along.  I felt that this book really needed more scrutiny in the editing process.  The \\"three stories in one\\" construction doesn't work that well, either.  After the first 150 pages, two of the stories are relegated to afterthoughts, and one of the stories is jettisoned altogether about 3/4 of the way through the book.  This plot device didn't really add much to the story, except to break up the monotony.  I found the ending was fairly predictable.  Most readers should guess it, despite the many layers Atwood adds, far before the end is reached.  Atwood has a thing for sentence fragments.  If that doesn't bother you, no problem.  If it does, you may find this tendency irritating.  All in all, The Blind Assasin is a decent, if flawed, work saved by concept and characterization.  However, the glacial pacing keeps me from recommending it too highly.	2010-04-05

I'm very particular about the type of books I like, and often times I'll get only a few chapters into a book before I decide I hate it. Luckily, The Blind Assassin kept me intrigued the whole way through, and I found myself taking every chance I could to find out what would happen next. It has its slow parts - the description of Benjamin Chase's button factory, for instance - but the mystery of the two anonymous lovers and Laura Chase's death kept me intrigued enough to continue on. Atwood's characterizations are great and I found myself very much attached to them by the end -- except, notably, for Laura Chase, whose quirkiness and mystery seemed forced and trite. Actually, I'll just say it bluntly: I really hated Laura Chase. Not to say that the other characters were much more likeable, but I could definitely sympathize with Iris Chase, who served as a very insightful narrator.    I didn't find this book overconvoluted at all, like some other reviewers complained. On the contrary, I found that the interweaving of the three (well I see it as four) stories gave the book a good dose of variety. The newspaper clippings added a little edge to it all too. If the storytelling had been linear I would have gotten easily bored. However, I don't think this interweaving was entirely necessary and I can see how some might find it gimmicky.     Nevertheless, overall Atwood's story stayed with me, and the world she created dwelled vividly in my mind long after I finished the book, which in my eyes is a sign of talented writing. No doubt, the Blind Assassin is a great book, and I'll be sure to pick up more Atwood novels in the future. However, I don't think it deserved more laudatory praise and awards than some of the other fantastic fiction outthere. I've read many other reviews that keep emphasizing Atwood's mastery over storytelling methods and historical detail and lyrical descriptions. True, she is very skilled, but clearly these reviewers have never read a novel by Ann-Marie MacDonald.	2008-04-03
US	21940113	RPRTKMJY9DOGX	0385475721	850910906	The Blind Assassin	Books	5	1	1	N	N	An enduring masterpiece	Sometimes, when reading a big book, one gets the feeling that the author set out to achieve size, as if that in itself might suggest certain adjectives from a reader or reviewer - weighty, significant, deep, serious, complex, extensive, perhaps. Sometimes - rarely, in fact - one reads a big book and becomes lost in its size, lost in the sense that one ceases to notice the hundreds passing by, as the work creates its own time, defines its own experience, shares its own world. Even then, reaching the end can often be merely trite, just a running out of steam, the process thoroughly engaging, the product, however, something of a let down. Rarely, very rarely indeed, one reads a big book that actually needs its size, justifies itself, continues to surprise as well as enchant and then, finally, stuns. Margaret Atwood's Blind Assassin is such a book, a giant in every sense, a masterpiece beyond question.<br /><br />Blind Assassin was awarded the Booker prize in 2000 and charts intersecting histories of two well-to-do Canadian families, Chase and Griffen. The two Chase sisters, Iris and Laura, are quite different people. Born into the relative opulence of a Canadian manufacturing family, they have a private education of sorts, experienced throughout and yet alongside something vaguely like a childhood. Various aspects of twentieth century history impinge upon their lives and eventually force their family to reassess its status. Economic downturn, war and family tragedy take their toll on the father, who becomes less able to manage either his own life or his business. Something has to give. Ways of coping must be found.<br /><br />Iris, the elder sister, is the first person narrator of about half of the book, the other half being devoted to a book within a book, a novel in the name of Laura, the younger sister. This novel, entitled The Blind Assassin, is an eclectic mix of experience, sex, fantasy and politics. It has made a name for Laura and retains a significant cult following many years after its publication. Laura, herself, died in a car accident. She drove off a bridge into a ravine. The car belonged to Iris. There was never any real explanation for the event.<br /><br />Iris, meanwhile, has been married off to an older man, a Griffen, who seems to treat her like so much chattel. But then he is an industrialist with the wherewithal, not to mention capital, to assist the bride's family business in its time of need. Iris, therefore, experiences the Canadian equivalent of an arranged marriage. Perhaps the word marriage is a little overstated. The partnership could be better described as a merger, or a union, if that were not a dirty word because of its political connotation.<br /><br />And so the octogenarian Iris, clearly anticipating the end of her days, embarks upon a cathartic outpouring of personal and family history in the hope that an estranged granddaughter might just understand a little about other peoples' motives.<br /><br />The book takes us through Canada and north America, across to Europe, via an imagined universe, to political commitment, direct action and its inevitable reaction. Iris needs to write it all down. And so she works her story out, constructing it, perhaps reconstructing it, maybe inventing it from memory and relived experience against a backdrop of contemporary Canada and her own failing health. Her vulnerability, in the end, is our debt, our penance, perhaps. She is a wise old woman with much to hide, but her acerbic wit is undiminished by age, her observations of others stunningly perspicacious.<br /><br />It is not often that a novel, a mere flight of another's fancy, achieves the subtle, stunning and surely enduring power of the Blind Assassin.s after its publication.

However, I ultimately found The Blind Assassin to be tedious and a struggle to finish, despite Atwood's beautiful writing style.  I suppose once you get to the end (if you make it) you'll see that it is cleverly wrapped up with a plot twist, but having to read the book is not worth the ending.  There are four different stories going on at once, and not one of them is particularly interesting.      There is the story of the protagonist growing up with her sister Laura which takes some time to get off the ground.  There is the story of her as an old woman which is depressing and doesn't ever have anything going on.  There is the plot line of two anonymous lovers who's story becomes increasingly sad and repetitive.  The last story is within the lovers', and it is science-fictiony and odd, told by the male lover without much feeling and yet a great chunk of the book is devoted to this tale.    The relative dullness of the stories, although poetically written, is made worse by the novel's length--it is SO long, that I just felt as if I'd been reading it forever.  This novel has many literary merits, but I personally found it to be slightly boring and too long for me to appreciate Atwood's writing skill or the ultimately clever ending.	2008-01-20

This book encompasses everything my forward-minded professors adored in modern literature: complicated plots, creative storytelling, literary allusions, feminist implications, symbolism and foreshadowing - all wrapped up into a neat yet complex package.    For the non-collegiate reader, The Blind Assassin has a lot to offer too. It's got a little romance, a bit of a Gothic tendency and a sci-fi tale all woven into one. It's not surprising that The Blind Assassin is so widely read and the recipient of prestigious awards.    For this reader, I enjoyed the book's story-within-the story style. The majority of the story is written from Iris's perspective - a woman born of privilege whose loveless marriage and complicated relationship with her father and sister lead her into the arms of a lover. The second story is a fictional book \\"written\\" by Iris's sister, Laura. It features a nameless man and woman as they sneak around to hide their affair. Their time together was spent making love and creating a story about a far-away race of aliens. To be honest, I could have done without the sci-fi element. I wonder why it was even included except to show some symbolism. Writers of less ability than Atwood would not have been able to pull it off, but to her credit, she did.    Overall, I enjoyed The Blind Assassin. It definitely piqued my interest in Margaret Atwood's other works. Based on this book, I can see why she has earned such literary praise and is the favorite writer of many avid readers. I just wonder if Atwood, at the top of her game, produced The Blind Assassin robotically - its literary conventions are almost too perfect; the story, predictable; and the ending, done before. Perhaps that's the magic of the whole thing - and a grand show of force from a writer who can do it all.	2007-07-21
US	52884397	RUW76O3IMSKP7	1860498809	850910906	The Blind Assassin	Books	2	6	11	N	N	Hidden Mystery	This book is so mysterious that most readers don't even know it's a mystery until the last 25 pages.  If you like nano-nuanced mysteries wrapped in enigmas, you'll love this book.  For those with logical minds, particularly males; read the last 25 pages first, so you won't spend the first 100 pages wandering what the blazes is going on.  Unless you enjoy caricatures of really bad sci-fi, you can also skip all the chapters on sacrificial maidens and red-panted lizards.     Once you've gotten through the first 100 pages, (if you don't cheat and read ahead) you'll conclude the following:    1. The writing is beautiful.  2. The characters are universally unappealing, especially the two apparently airhead heroines.  (They aren't really airheads, but this isn't revealed until the end.)   3.  The plot is so plodding it makes the characters look exciting.  4.  The egregious sci-fi stuff must have been thrown-in to reach the page minimum.  5.  The love scenes are so bad, unless you like sex in garbage, that they should be separately published as preventative tracts for parents of libidinous teenagers.    My theory of this book is that it was a brilliantly designed attempt to win a Booker prize.  The formula goes as follows:    1. Be Canadian, they were overdue.   2. Use a politically correct theme : All rich Canadians are either monsters or morons  is the result.  3. Make the plot so convoluted and mysterious that half the judges will conclude that this must be great literature.  4. Throw in some weird sci-fi stuff so the other judges will conclude that it must be a new genre.    She's a good writer, too bad she had to write something like this to get the prize.  Unfortunately, English teachers love it, and another generation of students will have it forced down their throats until they learn to hate all literature.	2007-06-20

Perhaps my expectations were set too high.<br /><br />Right, \\"The Blind Assassin.\\" What can I write about this book that won't give away THE BIG SECRETS (tm) at the end that pretend they are far more clever than they actually are? I suppose I should use a management tactic here and treat it like a performance review: I'll point out the problems I had with the book and try to finish on a more positive note.<br /><br />As this novel is a reflection, a gradual re-telling of events, the ending is supposed to cast the entire novel in a new light. I'll do what I can not to give too much of that away.<br /><br />First and foremost, Atwood's stories are not dizzingly complicated: they are modest and linear, but laden down with so many bells and whistles and red herrings that they give the illusion of being complex. Her stories move from A to B, and 300 pages of the main character waxing metaphoric on points C, D, E, F and G does not change this fact. I wrote in my review of Oryx and Crake that Atwood's \\"symbolism is generally hackneyed and trite,\\" and that unfortunately holds true here. She cannot play with the English language with the skill of a Nabokov or Rushdie, and there were numerous spots where metaphors felt as if they were a club being wielded by a cavewoman.<br /><br />The novel-within-a-novel initially throws the reader for a loop, but once you keep the two stories separately defined their connection becomes pretty obvious. By page 250 or so the big secrets have been all but given away for free to the astute reader, and then you get to sit back and trudge through 200 superfluous pages of mild tragedy and pseudo-Machiavellian themes before Atwood finally gets around to confirming what everyone already knows.<br /><br />I also had problems with the denouement, when you finally discover what pushed Laura over the edge and prompted her suicide (one of the main mysteries in the novel). Here Atwood hamstring's the entire novel, with a \\"The Usual Suspects\\" caliber plot twist that simply doesn't work and is wholly unbelievable if anything she wrote in the first 500 pages is event remotely truthful (primarily, the entire novel has painted Laura as an unusually astute and precocious young woman, and I find it difficult to believe the \\"BIG SECRET\\" revealed at the end would be a crushing enough blow to push her to suicide, or that she wouldn't have figured it out when she was alive).<br /><br />Aside from an unnecessary long-windedness and the big \\"surprise\\" plot-twist that hamstrung the plot, The Blind Assassin has some good points. Despite her narrator's tendency to dally too much, Atwood is a good story-teller, and The Blind Assassin is a good story. It's paints an excellent portrait of the extremes the wealthy will go to in order to control their world. It also portrays how women were treated not as people but as possessions well into the 20th century (consider Laura's and Iris's father, the industrialist: did he really have their \\"best interests\\" at heart?

The Blind Assassin is one of the best thought out and laid out novels I've ever encountered as its sub-novel, main novel shifts, characters and connection with her brilliant past works make this book a great reading experience.       <br />The shift from the main novel to the sub novel is immaculately written. There are two stories that are followed in this novel as a sub-novel, also called the Blind Assassin, is tracked.  The fact that the two stories put into one big story is done so seamlessly is amazing and downright genius of Margaret Atwood.   <br />The character development makes this a much more enjoyable read.  Characters like Iris Chase Griffin, Laura Chase, Richard Griffin and Winifred Griffin Prior are developed so well and let the reader connect emotionally with the novel.  From Iris and her horrible life experiences to Richard and his selfish, greedy ways the reader can't help but bring these characters to life in their head.   <br />The connection to her past novels is evident as her writing style can't be mistaken.  She, like the Handmaid's Tale, leaves this novel on an open note and leaves it up for the reader to decide on how the story ends.  This is the type of writing that has gotten Margaret Atwood the recognition she deserves.  Truly a great author in a time where reading isn't given much thought to anymore. <br />The Blind Assassin is a must read that is harder to put down as the story unfolds.  It is rather hard to get into it initially but once the reader is in, they can't get out because they just wouldn't want to.           <br /> <br /> <br />	2007-06-09

I nearly gave up on this book, but a friend urged me to keep going for the clever ending. I also liked one of the three strands of narrative - the one which, interestingly, is never resolved. <br /> <br />I'm a slow reader and I wish I'd followed my instincts. The twist at the end comes nowhere close to compensating the general lack of soul in this book. As I say, one of the interwoven stories - a clandestine love affair in which the man is also telling the story of the destruction of an imaginary planet - is good. It's crisp and well written, and you believe in the characters, which is important. <br /> <br />Would it were so in the several hundred other pages. The main narrative is written from the perspective of an old woman looking back over her life. I think Atwood means this character to come across as wry and cynical; but with her constant references to old age, she only manages to be self-conscious and trite. Not to mention self-pitying and passive - the worst qualities available to a protagonist. <br /> <br />I should say that several people I know love this book. But they're the kind of readers who are prepared to put up with cardboard characters, mediocre prose and gaping holes in return for a shiver at the end, I have to assume. If you want the shiver with no sacrifice to quality, try [[ASIN:067972267X A Pale View of Hills]] by Kazuo Ishiguro. <br />	2007-03-22

Eventually the connections between them become clear, but until the point of convergence I found the book difficult to follow and hardly page turning material. <br /> <br />But due to the satisfying revelation of the connection of the characters and the fictional material, as well as Atwood's unique writing from the perspective of an elderly character in a small town, the challenges of the early part of the novel are well rewarded in the conclusion.	2007-03-01

I believe that she is the greatest Canadian writer and deserving of the Nobel Prize for Literature.  However, I did not think that \\"The Blind Assassin\\" was one of her better efforts.  I say that because I found myself distracted by what I felt to be the needless inclusion of a somewhat related science fiction story with the main storyline.  The main story was about two sisters growing up in Canada between the wars.  The plot is not overyly compelling but that is not an issue with Atwood's novels.  Her skill as a writer is in the character development with which she is able to create a fictional character and bring that person to life.  Not coincidentally (but not necessarily either) she excels in bringing to life her female characters.  After reading her book \\"Cat's Eye\\" I came away thinking that that was the closest look I ever had into the mind of a woman by way of the written word.  I consistently come away from her books feeling that way.   <br /> <br />The heroine of \\"The Blind Assassin\\" is a complex woman and her struggles to get by bring out our empathy.  The book uses an effective series of news stories to give a quick peek into the past and future in a way that might seem to give away too much too soon.  However, the effect is more alluring than deceiving.  Somehow knowing that this or that person dies young or at at advanced age makes the book all the more interesting.  The problem with \\"The Blind Assassin\\" are the speed bumps created by the periodic insertion of excerpts from a science fiction novel that one of the characters wrote.  It just doesn't flow well.  I suspect that there is some great allegory between the main story and the Lizard Men of Zordon (or wherever).  Yet I was so engrossed in the other storyline that I really didn't care to do more than quickly read through these sections and get back to the real-life fiction.  Others, I'm sure, will disagree.  At one point, half way through the book, I set is asidefor several months before deciding to try tackling it again.  I'm glad I finished it because it is a well written story. <br /> <br />As I was finishing \\"The Blind Assassin\\", I realized why I felt that I got such a good insight to women through the eyes of Margaret Atwood.  Her leading female characters all seem to live a life of inner solitude.  They have relationships and they go through the outward commitments to others.  However, they seem to lack the strong emotional commitment that is what so many of us call \\"love\\".  The husbands and/or boyfriends are always imperfect enough that we wonder why the commitment was ever entered into in the first place.  They always seem like the compromise also known as \\"the best that I can do\\".  In all fairness, Atwood brings out the shortcomings of her heroines as well.  However, the women can see their compromised standard while the guys seem to numbly go about doing whatever it is they want to be doing.  Some may be manipulative (as is the husband in \\"The Blind Assassin\\"), others exploitive and still others oblivious of whatever role it is they're supposed to assume.  In the end, it all seems so empty.  If some see Feminism in all of this, I see Femininity but of a suffering kind.  Rather than depressing me, it leads me to think more along the lines of John Prine's song \\"Hello in There\\".  \\"The Blind Assassin\\" is certainly no romance novel; none of Atwood's works will ever be misidentified as such.  They are so much more than that.  Yet a little happy romance here and there could really light the place up.  Maybe that's what the science fiction portion was all about.	2006-01-12

Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't feel bored or strung along until the end. To me, the identities of the mystery lovers were evident early on. However, what kept me reading was the intriguing story of Iris' journey through life and how it related to her sister's untimely end - There's more than one mystery here! <br /> <br />The historical details in the book were also fascinating and not overly done - it gave a great taste of what times gone by were like for these people, socially and otherwise.  <br /> <br />The novel-within-a-novel idea is also fascinating and lends to the book's mystique. Through this vehicle, you get a different point of view on the lovers' relationship. It also gives strong hints as to what's going on beneath the surface in the sisters' real lives, reflecting their experiences in mythological, almost archetypal terms. <br /> <br />Overall, this is an excellent book, especially if you are looking for something bittersweet that has depth and is very well written.

After reading Margaret Atwood's \\"The Blind Assassin\\" I am not so sure. My teacher of literature defined true tragedy as one after which you cannot live the way you lived before. Using Sylvia Plath's symbolism: good tragedy shatters the bell jar that isolates you from your environment and you have to survive that experience (experiencing the world and yourself directly, as is, and without any excuses and euphemisms) by finding something it is worth living for. The Blind Assassin shattered my isolation from the world for a moment. People always rebuild their shelter, so my shell is hardening up again, but while the novel clearly lives in me, I see the world in a different light. Or less as a blur of self-evidence.<br /><br />More objectively, in this novel the author continues her exploration of the retrospective life-story telling. A character examines her past and together with her we can also understand the past, and present, better. (Past events re-emerge and we have a different view of them.) What's the difference between the previous similar work, Cat's Eye, and this one? For one, The Blind Assassin is much more complex, on the other hand, the pain is more intense and the burden of the past is more immense. Margaret Atwood has by now mastered this type of fiction in such a degree that I cannot see how she could possibly carry on on this path. (But then I thought the same after Cat's Eye.) It's no wonder that this book was followed by a negative-utopistic science fiction story, Oryx and Crake.<br /><br />Some practical advice: For impatient readers, it's not advisable to start the book from the beginning. (Of course you can read the newspaper article imitations to establish your expectations.) For them it's best to start from Chapter 3, with The Presentation, which could stand as a short story in itself. After this chapter you have to go back to the beginning anyway to understand the story better, but the chapter is fully comprehensible and enjoyable without the first two. Of course, avid Atwood readers do not need to apply such tricks. What is thirty-something pages of setting the scene for them? For us.<br /><br />As I mentioned, The Blind Assassin is very much like, even if much more complex than, a classical tragedy. However, this does not mean that it is somber and lacks humour. Continuing the Shakespearean tradition, Margaret Atwood uses humour (situational, ironical, absurd, black, self-deprecatory) as a natural ingredient of the novel. The story turns gloomier as it unfolds, but it remains witty until the end.u have to go back to the beginning anyway to understand the story better, but the chapter is fully comprehensible and enjoyable without the first two.

Yet Atwood isn't content with mere metafiction: instead she takes the concept and cubes it. Here we have a sci-fi parable within a steamy novella within a confessional journal within a novel, all interspersed by newspaper clippings, and the remarkable thing is how everything interweaves so effortlessly and believably.<br /><br />Iris Chase is writing the journal that frames Atwood's novel. She relates the daily, humiliating burdens of old age and reflects on the familial and societal circumstances that led her sister Laura to an apparent suicide half a century earlier. Alongside this journal we read Laura Chase's posthumously published noir-style novella called \\"The Blind Assassin,\\" concerning a well-to-do woman (someone a lot like Laura or Iris) and her torrid, secretive affair with a \\"Red\\" (as in proletarian) rabble-rouser. The book's publication made Laura famous in death, both because of the explicitness for its time and, in later years, because of its subtle feminist message, which made her grave a shrine of sorts. And, finally, within that novella is a pulp fiction science fiction story about the Planet Zycron and its bizarre inhabitants, a morality tale related by the boyfriend to his lover during their trysts.<br /><br />On some level, Atwood's book is a mystery novel--there are several revelations along the way--but (smartly) she doesn't make too much of these secrets. As Iris says when she uncovers the final skeleton (and I won't spoil it here): \\"But you must have known that for some time.\\" And, it's true, most readers will figure out the book's secrets many pages or even chapters before their unveiling. But deciphering the secrets is not even half the fun of this novel. Instead the marvel is watching Atwood fit all the pieces together, create characters that are both fascinating and realistic, and narrate four different (if interconnected) stories in authentically unique styles.ating and realistic, and narrate four different (if interconnected) stories in authentically unique styles.	2004-08-23

Chase is an old woman, trying to outrace her &quot;misbehaving&quot; heart, scribbling away on loose leaf notepaper day after day, transcribing her thoughts, documenting her daily doings, remembering the past. She wants to leave behind a legacy of sorts, an explanation of her life for her grandaughter Sabrina from who she is estranged.<br />Atwood publishes a book every few years and I have read all of them except THE HANDMAID'S TALE (lacking in courage I suppose). I never cease to be impressed with her talent and dexterity as a writer, and the beauty of her written words. As I have aged, her books have kept pace with my development or lack thereof. She speaks to me, saying things I think (do you really want someone going through your things when you die?) and expressing feelings I feel (who does not grieve?)<br />She raised my consciousness with LIFE BEFORE MAN, made me laugh with LADY ORACLE, fed my need for the mystical with ALIAS GRACE, and helped me put old resentments to rest with CAT'S EYE. Now as I enter what the insurance companies describe as the &quot;high risk&quot; years, she arrives with THE BLIND ASSASSIN to help me put my house of memories in order.<br />Atwood says, &quot;Happiness is a garden walled with glass: there's no way in and no way out. In paradise there are no stories, because there are no journeys.&quot; On earth our lives are stories with a beginning a middle and an end. If you truly live you must love, and if you love, sooner or later the blind assassin rips out your heart and you become--says Iris--a hard-boiled egg with a missing yolk.<br />There are two main stories, one &quot;tale&quot; and a few asides in THE BLIND ASSASSIN. The silly sci-fi incident referred to by another reviewer is a toss-away tale, not the crux of either of the two main stories or the tale. The primary story is Iris's somewhat deconstructed autobiography. Most of the action in her chronicle takes place in the 1930s and early 1940s just prior to and during WWII and concerns her childhood and early adult years with her sister Laura.<br />For a while, you may not know who is telling the second story interwoven through Iris' tale, as it has been written in the third person. This story is lyrical and absolutely haunting --reminscent of the poetic writing in the THE ENGLISH PATIENT. The second story takes place during the same period as the first. &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot; is also the title of a tale constructed by one of the characters for the amusement of another. This latter piece reminds me of one of Scherazade's tales set in an exotic place in Western Asia.<br />Does God have a left hand? Laura asks. In French left is mal or bad. How can God have a bad hand. But man is made in God's image and men have left hands so God must have a left hand. But who would sit on God's left or bad hand?

I wasnt disappointed as I found it a wonderfully juicy read, and quite different in style to her other books. It is true to a certain extent that the characters were somewhat lacking in depth, and this is the main reason it didnt get the fifth star from me. However, as the novel progresses and one watches with infuriation and pity as Iriss life unravels due to her ineffectiveness to assert herself or to take control of her destiny, one cannot help being deeply moved. <BR>Its a book which I have lent to my closest friends only, and look forward to rereading next year.	2001-09-28

Margaret Atwood has written a brilliant multi-layered story.<BR>Two days after the end of WWII, young Laura Chase drives her car off a bridge. Her death is ruled accidental, though suspicions of suicide are bandied about. The narrator of this story is Laura's sister, Iris, now in her 80s.<BR>After Laura's death a manuscript was found among her things. This novel was published, and made Laura Chase a cult heroine. This novel-within-a-novel tells the story of two anonymous lovers, she of high social standing, he of working class origin. He is on the run from the Red Squads, Communist hunters of the time. In their assignations, he tells her a continuing story, a pulp magazine tale of the planet Zycron, with its virgin sacrifices, undead women who prey upon travellers, and slave children who are put to work weaving beautiful carpets until their eyes give out. When the children become blind they are trained as assassins who contract their services to the highest bidders.<BR>Iris, the narrator, was given into marriage at age 17, to a man she despised, in order to cement an alliance which would save her father's button factory.  The factory was failing, a victim of the Depression of the 1930s.<BR>The novel shifts back and forth in time, and covers the years between the first World War and the present. It is rich in characterization, and Atwood's writing and use of the idioms of the period are impeccable. When Reenie, the housekeeper, talked, I could hear my mother speaking. Atwood's love and mastery of the language is apparent on every page.<BR>Iris is not a perfect person, but to give her credit, she realizes that she is a bit of a snob, and that most times she opted for an easy life over a true one. When she was young her father tried to teach her his business, but she chose not to make the effort, and allowed herself to be pushed into a loveless marriage.<BR>Her sister, Laura, on the other hand had a social conscience, and fell in love as a teenager with a social activist who was on the run--obviously the basis for the character in her book.<BR>I loved this book, and many times stopped short after reading a sentence and said to myself, &quot;Yes! That's exactly right! I wish I had written those words!&quot;. The only criticism I have is that the story lags a bit in the last 100 pages. The final twist of the novel is not terribly hard to predict, but satisfying all the same.	2001-09-03

Through out the novel, Atwood drops hints as to who the mysterious lovers are in the embedded novel of the same name, but you can't really be sure who they are until the very end. However the path to get there is tedious, and although I found the conclusion rather satisfying, the bulk of the novel in between was quite bland and uninteresting.<BR>At first the deviations into science fiction and suspense via the lover's after the deed story telling provides some distraction from Iris' long and boring life, but even this fabricated story becomes too repetitive. Laura Chase is the only character in the novel that was of any interest, her sister Iris and the rest of the cast were cookie-cutter characters with hardly any depth. It was infuriating to passively watch Iris get sold off to her husband, it seems as if she spends her entire life in the passenger seat of a car, she is never driving, and she hardly makes any movement to control the direction she's going in. She rarely does anything for herself- the only major thing she ever does is revealed at the end of the novel. I won't give it away, but then again it's not worth reading 500 pages to discover.<BR>As summer reading, I found it difficult to turn the pages, the plot barely exists and the two page chapters barely sink their teeth into you before you are force fed a fabricated newspaper article that usually has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the book. And then you have to read about Iris going to the restroom in a donut shop.	2001-08-30

More than one reader confesses to having to keep referring back to previous chapters to make sense of the narrative. This is proof of good writing? I'll admit that the writing itself is often beautiful and powerful, but it's all in the service of a long, drawn-out novel with a surprise twist everyone but myself seems to have figured out. I knew there was &quot;something&quot; coming, but when it did (or seemed to) I had to read the same pages over and over to try and make sense of it. The denouement seemed awfully elliptical or cryptic or...maybe just not clearly written. Or would that have been banal? I didn't enjoy the novel-within-the-novel. The most surprising thing in the whole book was Atwood's narrator's admission, toward the end, that one of the characters she's written of came off as a cardboard cutout, not three-dimensional! If only the rest of the book had been as honest. By the time I finished, I was aware of the same feeling I had after seeing &quot;American Beauty&quot;: that the style of the piece was more compelling than the content; that the gloss of &quot;art&quot; couldn't, ulimately, keep me from thinking &quot;So what?&quot;	2001-08-28

While lizard-men capitalists prey on the helpless mute virgins, the abused secretly seek solace with the persecuted working-class carpet (or button) makers. One cannot help but side with the commies. What's Atwood's message here? Why oh why can't these women rise above their predicaments and take action? Why can't women escape! Iris Chase has the opportunity to learn her father's button business but has no interest. The only paying jobs Laura Chase can think of are carnival booths and dog walking. What a tragedy.

IÕve read every one of her novels and never been disappointed. She has consistently been the most entertaining of literary writers. <br />Before I read the book, I glanced at the reviews and was disappointed by their vagueness. Some people loved it, some people hated it (a writer as intelligent and original as Margaret Atwood invites extreme reactions), but nobody explained very clearly, I thought, what the novel was about. Now that IÕve read it, I understand the vagueness, and sympathize with the reviewers. ItÕs impossible to explain much of anything about The Blind AssassinÕs plot without ruining it for another reader. The novel revolves around a woman in her eighties, Iris Chase-Griffen, whose sister, Laura, famous as the author of a science fiction novel with a cult-like following, died more than fifty years ago, possibly a suicide. A few years after LauraÕs death, IrisÕs husband also dies, also a possible suicide. And thirty years later, IrisÕs only daughter dies in an accident involving drugs and alcohol. We learn all this within the first twenty pages of the novel, and spend the next five hundred pages trying to figure out the relationships between these people and events. To give you even one more hint about the plot would wreck the suspense. As in AtwoodÕs previous novel, Alias Grace, the more you learn, the farther from the truth you seem to get. The suspense holds you right to the last page. <br />The best thing about The Blind Assassin is the main character (and narrator for most of the book). Iris Chase-Griffen is one of AtwoodÕs most interesting characters to date. She has a cranky, curmudgeonly streak that allows Atwood to give freerein to her biting wit (while reading the book, I kept driving my family crazy repeating deliciously mordant Atwoodisms Ð they were so good, so funny, I couldnÕt keep them to myself). But as the novel progresses, you discover a pain under the wit that makes her a more complex and interesting character than you first gave her credit for. By mid-novel, itÕs no longer just the suspenseful plot that keeps you turning pages, but also a fascination with Iris. <br />As much as I enjoyed The Blind Assassin, I donÕt think itÕs AtwoodÕs best. I prefer both The HandmaidÕs Tale and Alias Grace Ð and if you have never read a book by Margaret Atwood before, IÕd suggest reading one of those before you read this one. In the Blind Assassin, Atwood uses a trick of speaking of characters only as &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she,&quot; without naming them, so that you canÕt tell until the very end who the characters are. In the end, her reason for doing that makes sense, but it still seemed a little bit of a cheat. Also, she has bits of Laura ChaseÕs science fiction novel scattered throughout the book. To some extent, it reflects and comments on the lives of the people in AtwoodÕs novel. At least I think that was AtwoodÕs intention. I donÕt think she completely pulls it off, and that disappointed me a little, because I think exploring the connection between authorsÕ lives and the fiction they create would have been fascinating. Including more of the science fiction novel would have made The Blind Assassin even better than it is. <br />But those are quibbles. This may not be Margaret AtwoodÕs best, but thatÕs an awfully high standard to hold anyone to. It would be most writersÕ masterpiece. You really donÕt want to miss this book.	2001-08-27

This is the very first book that I've read, written by Margaret Atwood. Her excellent writing style, poetic prose, unforgettable sub-plots (especially Xenorians, Sakiel-Norn and other mind staggering stories) inside the deeply fulfilling plot made me felt rewarded as a reader after I read the last page just five minutes ago. Iris Chase and Laura Chase, the two main characters, were brilliantly depicted. Reenie's witty remarks, Winnefred's gaudiness, and Richard Griffen's highly ambitious but lurid characters were all portrayed with the guile of a master of art. The soliloquies of the main character are simply unforgettable. I've read few other booker prize winning books in the last few years, The Blind Assassin by Margaret Atwood is the best among them. I heartily recommend it.	2001-08-27

However, by no means should you pass up the chance to read The Blind Assassin!  Atwood is clearly at the top of her form here, and her command of the language is nothing short of stunning.

This is partly because Atwood, even at her darkest, writes wonderful prose filled with innovative, yet apt metaphors.  The Blind Assassin, though, is far more than great writing.  Here, Atwood keeps us guessing throughout the entire book about the relationships involving the narrator and her deceased sister.  The characters are vividly drawn, particularly that of the chief villain, the narrator's sister-in-law.  The plot, subplot, the story that one character, a sometime writer, is fabricating, and excerpts from a novel published by one of the sisters are all beautifully interwoven.  The book is set primarily during the era between the two world wars and contains historical background on Canada during this period that is also of interest.  This book, which plays with the role of artifice in daily life, is definitely a work of art itself deserving of the Booker Prize!	2001-08-08

I despaired that they would continue choosing bland, but well written novels, ignoring the fact that readers like to be entertained as well as seeing the literary goal posts lifted. The Blind Assassin achieves both. It has a well-plotted story and is written in a free-flowing style that could best be described as `seamless'.<br />The Blind Assassin tells a story of two sisters. Sometimes the story is told in the first person, so there's no doubt about who is who. Sometimes it's told in the third person, and puzzling out which of the sisters is involved in the plot is the central theme of the book. You'd think, with just two people to choose from, that this would be relatively easy, but it's not. For different reasons, either of them could fit into the action. And (unless you're blessed with 20/20 visionary powers) the ending should come as a complete surprise.<br />The opening chapters were difficult to get into. This isn't an easy beach read (at least, not to begin with). It's stylish and graceful, and it's well worth persevering because, from about page 100 onwards, everything that has come before suddenly starts to slot into place.<br />The characterizations were superb, particularly that of Winifred. Some reviewers feel that her brother Richard was not well characterized, but it was quite unnecessary to do so, since it was clear that Winifred was the driving force behind his success. And this alone demonstrates a skill beyond many writers.<br />The Blind Assassin with haunt you long after you turn the final page.	2001-08-05

She's a storyteller in the grandest sense, with intricately woven plotlines, and engaging and mysterious characters. The two central to this story are sisters, Iris and Laura Chase. The former is our narrator, and she opens the book by recounting on page one the circumstances of her sister's death. From there the book moves from the present, back to the past, and to a novel within the novel that slowly reveals its' origins as the story progresses. This is not a light read, and the multiple stories demand your attention, very much like A.S. Byatt's &quot;Possession.&quot; Yet the writing is so rich, and the story so absorbing, I found it a thoroughly rewarding read.	2001-07-22

Atwood's latest---winner of the Booker Prize--is several novels within a novel--the story of a rich woman's clandestine affair with a leftist agitator in Canada in the 30's, a science fiction tale, the memories and dreams of an old woman full of longing and regret. Atwood leads the reader down many blind alleys and then almost casually reveals that everything that has gone before really happened in a completely different way. Several times I went back to attempt to discover how she did it--why did I so clearly think &quot;X&quot; was the case when now I see clearly that it was &quot;Y&quot; all along? The reader's experience mirrors that of the characters'--Atwood suggests we all live in our own worlds, focused on our needs, desires, and pain, only dimly perceiving what is really going on. Atwood writes in several different styles in this book, with great skill and a real feel for dialogue. You'll enjoy this one.	2001-07-16

Although I am usually not fond of a plot that leaves the reader guessing throughout (mostly because the author fails, and I know &quot;who done it&quot; right away), THIS novel kept me guessing right up until the end.<br />Atwood does an incredible job of telling a story within a story (within a story), being careful not to slip and give away the ending.

I must say I liked Alias Grace better, but in my opinion Atwood is getting much better at telling good stories. Her previous novels (e.g. Cat's Eye, The Robber Bride) had great characters, pithy social commentary, and continually witty turns of phrase, but I couldn't call the plots exactly gripping.  <br />The Blind Assassin has all these previous great characteristics, but also kept me intrigued throughout, especially with its mysteries about who is who and writing what. Perhaps I'm a little dense at picking up clues (other I know are better than I am, and found some!) but I could not predict the ending. I knew it wasn't going the direction it seemed, or the semi-obvious alternative -- and I gathered who was the woman having the affair with Alex -- but I wasn't prepared for the final revelation about the famous authoress. And I must say I was far more delighted at being so surprised than figuring it out earlier!<br />Atwood's technique of tossing in non-chronological newspaper articles certainly added to the plot's weavings and untanglings. (And her descriptions of women's clothing are priceless!) I had to go back and forth to find previous references to the same event as stated in the newspaper, or obscure character references, but this didn't detract from the reading experience at all. I like to work a little at my reading, not have it all handed to me plain and simple, and The Blind Assassin is that kind of book!<br />I also really appreciate how Atwood is delving more into Canadian history for her novels, how the socio-political scene affected, and was affected by, ordinary people -- and ordinary wealthy industrialists, of course! <br />Atwood's first sentence alone is a masterpiece: \\"Ten days after the war ended, my sister Laura drove a car off a bridge.\\" Now that deserves to be in a list of 10 best first sentences of all time!<br />I also love Atwood playing so creatively with sci-fi! I remember hearing her speak about her brother's horde of sci-fi comics, and how she devoured them as well. The sci-fi novel-within-a-novel shows her impish non-literary underbelly -- with the secret, steamy bedroom settings as a bonus!<br />If you're looking for a complex, multi-level novel, that will keep you pondering it's subtleties and implications for months to come, this is it!	2001-07-04

I am a fast reader and I generally whip through books... this one takes a bit longer- but it's worth it, and I think it's good when a novel asks you to pay attention.<br />When I finished the book I felt taken aback and admittedly, a bit teary... and, the best part...

Not the tedious and degrading love story recounted in Laura Chase's book of that name, but the actual story of the blind assassin and his tongueless maiden.  The book Atwood wrote is tedious, and the characters uninteresting, except for Laura herself; but Atwood begins to tell a very interesting account of the blind assassin, and then ends it lamely, as if she didn't care about it--OK, her character who was telling the story didn't care about it much.  It wasn't much more than just an idea for a story which needed more development, but Atwood would have done better to focus on it, and toss out the rest of this novel.  She writes like a poet, when she isn't being unecessarily vulgar, and I liked some of her observations; but I don't like these characters as much as she did.<br />Does anyone else see the characters and situations from the movie Titanic in this book?  The Rose (of Titanic) who is almost willing to knuckle under to pressure from family and peers and become the rich man's spoiled bride, transforms into Iris.  Only Iris does marry the rich man, and it ruins her life.  The Rose who won't behave as expected--who is passionate and empathetic--becomes Laura Chase.  Rose nearly jumps overboard into the ocean at the beginning of the movie, Laura does commit suicide by driving a car off a bridge into a river.  The Rose of the movie becomes two sisters in the book.  <br />Movie Rose is warned to submit to her rich fiancee to save her family from ruin, and, later, to save her lover's life.  The book Iris/Laura are given the same two choices.  The movie's Jack Dawson is a young adventurer and artist, who draws pictures of Paris prostitutes.  The book also has a Jack Dawson type, but he is a socialist adventurer who writes lurid space operas for magazines like Amazing Stories.  Both versions of Jack can produce art of a high quality when they wish to, but neither takes his art completely seriously.  Rose begins the movie as an old lady whose only family--as far as we can see--is her grandaughter and old Rose narrates the story.  In the book, Iris' only family is her grandaughter, and old Iris tells us this story.  The book's Iris, Rose and company all go sailing on a cruise ship, the Queen Elizabeth, that is the most fabulous cruise ship yet built, and is on its maiden voyage.  It doesn't sink, however.  <br />Something else I noticed.  There are several movies that begin by showing us the death of a main character, then telling us this character's story, just as this book begins by telling of Laura's suicide, then telling us about Laura by way of her sister Iris.  Citizen Kane is such a movie, as is The Third Man and Sunset Boulevard.  More importantly, so is the movie Laura.  But I wouldn't want to mislead anyone:  the Laura of the book really is dead.  There is a bit of a mystery here, but readers will probably figure it out early, when they still have more than half the book to get through.	2001-06-28

One reviewer in particular said that he normally reads a book &quot;in one night&quot;. (Which from my perspective, gives a good image of the person's reading habits.  Golly, &quot;War and Peace&quot; and &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; make good one night reads, don't they?;) The &quot;Blind Assassin limited him to 10 pages, and then he needed to put it down. This novel sure isn't Tolstoy, however, in fairness.<br />Frankly, I think reading this in short spurts was Atwood's intent.  The characters might have seemed one-sided, aloof and detached, but the writing was just too rich.  It almost demanded reading a few chapters at a time and putting it down.<br />Think of this book as a huge jigsaw puzzle.  The puzzle may look confusing and at times pointless, but once put together, you get a complex story with what I think is a very satisfying conclusion.<br />There are descriptive passages which at first seem tossed-off, but are rich in detail, truths, and not without some well-deserved sarcasm.<br />And this is NOT &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot;, nor is this her best work.  And if you are genuinely unfamiliar with Atwood's work, this could be off-putting.<br />But if you really like her and are willing to go the distance with the book, I think you'll enjoy it. (I took two weeks with it--taking breaks with other books at the same time.)<br />Yeah, I gave it five stars, but I couldn't argue with those who gave it but four.<br />It's well worth a try.	2001-06-23

I normally read a book a day. This book took me over a week to read as I kept picking it up, reading ten pages and shoving it aside.  The characters were unlikeable, lethargic and did nothing. Even Iris, who is looking back on her life with regret, didn't really do anything - she just sat there and let everyone else around her have their lives destroyed. But, even then I didn't care enough to even hate Iris, she was just simply there like a whisper of smoke - no substance, no character, no appeal - vaccuous.<br />I expected much better, not only because of the Booker, but also because I have read all of Atwood's previous books and liked them very much.  This was just too long and too uninteresting to hold my attention.<br />An interesting idea but I think Atwood could have written it in a much more captivating way.  Very disappointing.	2001-06-18

In &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot; Margaret Atwood has produced a cast of characters so unsympathetic and one dimensional that one cares very little about them or what happens to them.  On top of that, her writing is so heavy handed that she telegraphs all of their &quot;sordid secrets&quot; well ahead of their denouement.

The story of Iris and Laura Chase is a rather sad one and in many ways pathetic.  The characters are well drawn but they are all - including Iris, the narrator of the story, rather shallow (the characters themselves -- not the writing of them.)  Iris, in the later stages of her life does become a more substantive person -- but too late.  The novel is really her apologia for what she didn't do in her life, especially for sister and daughter.  The novel is well paced and there are many foreshadowings, if you pay close attention, that will clue the reader in to what would otherwise be a real kicker in the end.  The \\"novel\\" within the novel worked well too, although I wonder if a more straightforward narrative approach wouldn't have worked better in telling the story.  I found \\"The Blind Assassin\\" -- the novel embedded in the story, rather repetitive -- it was the same scene and happenings over and over again.  In some ways that was the point, but it bogged down the flow the events.  But overall a definite thumbs up.	2001-06-02

Thrown in for good measure at strategic intervals are newspaper articles covering the deaths and other choice moments in the lives of the characters, most of whom move in the upper echelon of Canadian society.  We know that at some point the importance of the novel-within-a-novel (in which a man tells science-fiction stories to the woman with whom he is having an affair in backstreet rooms) for the real life story (the girl's father owns a button factory who marries off Iris to stave off financial ruin) will become painfully clear.  &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot; is not allegorical, mainly because it is to personal a tale to have that broad a meaning for its readers.  As Iris approaches death at the turn of the century, she looks back on her life in the 1930's and 40's, explaining it so that we understand the true import of her sister's novel.<br />I usually devour novels at a frantic pace but that proved impossible with &quot;The Blind Assassin.&quot;  This was one of those novels where you would finish a part, which alternate between the narrative and the novel, and mull over what had just happened and how the pieces were coming together.  But even getting through individual chapters took time, because there were so many wonderfully written lines, so many finely crafted paragraphs, that you just had to sit back and enjoy them (or run around sharing them with people who were unfortunate enough not to have read this book yet).  Young Laura Chase tends to take things literally, and this old literary chestnut blooms anew in Atwood's novel; pithy sayings and wise old adages are routinely scrutinized for fallacious qualities throughout.  The result of this infatuation with Atwood's exquisite use of language is that I did not see the forest for the trees and was therefore completely stunned by the way things came together at the end.  But that is just fine, because it has been such a long time since I have read a book this well written.  I do not think it is destined to be a classic per se, because ultimately its greatness rests on style more than substance, but in terms of contemporary fiction this would have to rank on the next rung down the ladder.

It's complex plotting and depiction of the main characters through various stages of their lives is an enviable accomplishment. The story-within-a-story device is managed incredibly well by Atwood. If you are a fan of her other works (`Alias Grace' is sill my favourite and her best) don't hesitate to purchase this novel. If you're not a fan, purchase it anyway.

She is a master of structure, and The Blind Assassin is truly a gem as far as structure goes. The characters are also interesting and true to life, at first. The book reads like a mystery novel, always keeping you wanting more. Although I knew halfway through who was who, I felt compelled to keep on. So, what's wrong? why only 3 stars? Atwood does not convey emotions. The characters are interesting but not real. I couldn't help but compare this thick novel (two or three trees per book?) to The Bridges of Madison Country which while being so small and simple, engages you and makes you feel every emotion possible. This book leaves you cold or worse, wondering, how can people be like that? How could Iris be so naive and good as to marry Richard, then so wise and deceitful as to meet her lover always with a micky at hand? just doesn't fit. How could he love her as he did while he had nothing of his true self to share with her but his stories? How could Laura really be gotten at by Richard? the whole thing is a work of clever and wonderful structure, but truly lacks emotion. Something was missing as she wrote this.	2001-04-27

In Cat's Eye the child betrayee becomes the adult betrayer and in Robber Bride one woman betrays just about everyone she meets and her victims keep coming back for more. In Blind Assassin, while the men certainly get in on the act, the main betrayal is that of Iris toward her sister, Laura. But unlike Cat's Eye, with its frightening childhood dramas, and Robber Bride, with a villainess so depraved only the truly naïve and lonely could trust her, Blind Assassin unfolds a more subtle and yet more hauntingly real tale of the ways in which we betray each other - and ourselves - every day. <br />Iris is not a bully, in fact she loves Laura and wants to protect her. But she is lazy and a coward. When her father &quot;suggests&quot; she marry Richard she immediately falls limp and stays that way until Laura's death. She's not happy, but it is a relief after all these years to stop worrying about what will happen to her - she relinquishes all power to Richard and Winifred and is therefore free of responsibility, for herself or for Laura, who is a minor. At the same time, there's more than a little spite: she takes grim satisfaction in Laura's horror of the marriage; she wants Laura to see what a sacrifice she has made. Like many people who have chosen their own misery, a part of her wants to drag the innocent down with her, make the eternally hopeful and unconventional Laura see &quot;reality&quot;. She doesn't really intend for Laura to be hurt; she becomes so deliberately vacuous it's impossible that she could foresee what would happen, but betrayal through neglect is often how we do the most damage. <br />I've devoured almost all of Atwood's novels, but I found this one to be the most compelling and thought provoking. I also think that with this and Alias Grace before it, she has hit her narrative stride. Blind Assassin moves like an introspective Gothic mystery, you think you know what happens, and then you end up reprocessing the information, hungry for more. The rich details provide us with clues along the way, for example a description of one sister's mannerisms in &quot;real life&quot; show up often in the novel-within-a-novel. And a description of the photograph toward the beginning almost tells the entire story.<br />My only real beef is that Iris was so passive from the beginning of her marriage - I would have liked to have seen her disillusionment come in stages - she never seems to have any feelings for Richard and Winifred at all, so how can we believe that she felt so betrayed and surprised by them? But that is a minor flaw in this intricately woven emotional tapestry.<br />Re: the flak about the science fiction story - I agree with the reviewer who said those folks are missing the point. The way I saw it is that the only way the man can move this woman is with these schlocky, obvious pulp stories which he himself despises but is forced to write for a living. The way she responds to them is a metaphor for her emotional dilettantism, just as the stories themselves are metaphors for the larger goings-on.	2001-04-19

In fact, while reading it, found the story-within-a story and frequent flash-backs/flash-forwards frustrating.  But as the story progressed, and I came to understand more about the plot and the characters, I started to enjoy the style of writing much more--to the point that I couldn't put the book down.<br />So while this book was one of the most frustrating reading experiences, it was also ultimately one of the most satisfying.  And it made for an excellent discussion in the book club.<br />I won't reveal any plot details other to reiterate another reviewers point that the science fiction portions need to be read metaphorically and as a way of understanding the characters spinning the stories.<br />Finally, while I don't personally recommend this, one of the women in our club actually decided to read the end first, then start over--this definitely combats the frustration factor but to me takes the edge off of satisfaction once the book's been fully read and absorbed.	2001-04-19

After having read the book, I just want to address two of the many criticisms readers are levelling at it:<br />1. Many readers are saying they did not care for the science fiction parts.  I guess you can't make much of a counterargument against someone simply disliking something, but this is silly. These people have bad taste. You should not listen to anyone who says they don't like something without explaining why. I'm not one of those strange-looking flannel-wearing folk who camp out in the fantasy book section of the book store, but I like science fiction as much as anything else. To me, saying you don't like the science fiction parts of The Blind Assassin is as ludicrous as saying you don't like the fiction parts. Science fiction deals with the same elements that other fiction has: warmth, a new perspective, humor, complexity, passion. And you get a bonus: you get to see what remains human despite all the technology we create to camouflage our weaknesses. The science fiction parts in The Blind Assassin were no less moving than the rest of the book. In fact, they were the real highlights. The science fiction part of the novel is actually a story within a story: what makes it particularly interesting is not the story itself, but what it says about the characters who are telling it. Atwood expertly weaves the science fiction novel into the real-life memoir of the narrator, Iris. While Iris shapes her memoir around what is concealed, keeping it spare and lean, these science fiction scenes, filled with lovers and gentle teasing and sacrificial virgins, are honest and real and conceal nothing. You could touch and feel and hear and smell them. They break your heart. The only way I can understand this criticism is that these people must not understand the pulp science fiction tale for the campy, snarky, metaphor that it is. I admit to being a lazy reader, but these people are lazier.<br />2.The other criticism people are making is that the ending is predictable. They are just trying to sound smart by asserting that they guessed the ending from the very beginning. How many plot twists does a book have to have in order to please everyone? Hamlet, King Lear, and Middlemarch should be rewritten to please these people.<br />If you are thinking about buying this book but hesitate because of the bad reviews, don't listen to them. They're just being picky. It's a lot easier to think of something bad to say about a book you don't understand than to admit that your initial reactions to the unfamiliar got in the way of enjoyment and understanding, and that maybe you'll need to re-read it before you can give an informed opinion.being a lazy reader, but these people are lazier. <br />2.The other criticism people are making is that the ending is predictable.

It is brillant, in the way it is masterfully woven together.  Atwood combines the novel within a novel beautifully.  And as for what the novel within is all about...it is an allegory showing that we are mute virgins and blind assassins... <br />The story grabbed me from the very first words.  Atwood's character, Iris, seemed stoic and unloving at first, but we soon realize she is more of a victim of her life than a cold woman.  She starts at her sister's &quot;mysterious&quot; car accident in which she drove off a bridge.  From there, it goes back in time and chronicles her life, with the novel within intersperced, which we increasingly understand the parallels between the two story lines.  <br />I have never read something more enjoyable.  I finished this book in two days, unable to function simply because I was that enthralled.  She paints an interesting world in which the characters are very real.  You hate some of them, love others...and feel ambivalent towards the rest... I can't believe how much I began to care about these characters.<br />The book is very emotional, and certainly isn't a particularly light read.  It has its moments, but the bombardment of emotion is quite unsettling, but I enjoy that.  <br />The bottom line is: the novel has a good plot, wonderful characters, and an interesting arrangement.  It is most definitely one of the best books I've read.	2001-04-10

Margaret Atwood is simply a brilliant author and this is one of her best.  A favorite quality in her books is to take an experience, thought or feeling and transform it into language so close to home, you feel like you've heard yourself say it. There are several passages in this book that ring true to personal experience beyond the boundaries of time or perspective.  This is to say nothing of her unique ability to tell a story without sounding formulaic or trite. This novel moves from past events, including a foray into a separate fictional realm, into the present, and back again. It digresses at points to show a window on the character's past which affects how they, and we, relate to the events. This technique is not difficult to read but thoroughly engaging.  Lose yourself in this narrative and enjoy the journey.	2001-04-09

I picked up this book because I wanted to read more of Atwood's razor-sharp family history narrated by a woman. I enjoyed &quot;The Robber Bride&quot; very much, and &quot;Cat's Eye&quot; was also good, although the end disappointed me a bit. I didn't care because I don't read a book because of its ending anyway. <br />The Blind Assassin features the story of the Chase family (who is not quite a dynasty), and those bits were just great. I can see why Atwood got the Booker Prize for this one here. With only a few poignant sentences, she can evoke characters, situations, and, most of all, atmosphere with great detail and density. I disagree with Iris Chase when she apologizes for not having drawn Richard Geffen (another blind assassin in his own way) in more detail. I found him being there, and I despised him from the beginning. An even stronger case in point is Winifred: she does appear only very rarely in the text, but I was surprised at how much I came to hate her. Each and every character is drawn strongly in the text. That's not to say that the heroines are intelligent, but damsels in distress and prone to twists of faith all the time. Far from it - sometimes I was exhausted with Laura's naïve world views or Iris' passivity. Even with their flaws, they were wonderfully rounded characters, and interesting to read about, for instance Laura's problems with God or Iris' sarcasm as an old woman.<br />There are, however, those excerpts of a novel-in-the-novel called &quot;The Blind Assassin,&quot; wherein a man tells a fantasy story to a woman (both will be identified at some point in the text). What were those for? He is a Communist, and they are having an affair, okay, so far I understood it; but what else is it for except to let the man rant about her being rich and maybe unfaithful with someone other than him? Such stuff is dangerously close to mindless man-bashing, and Atwood is way above such cheap tricks. Some of the passages are screamingly funny because theyare your stereotypical fantasy stuff (check out &quot;Peach Women of Aa'A), but otherwise I was confused. <br />Maybe I didn't get the point. There is a lot of stuff in the text that you are likely to overread - allusions to texts by Dante, the Book of Daniel, and so on, besides the obvious references to Coleridge and others. What is more, I don't know enough about Canadian history to get all the references in the newspaper clippings, but that did not keep me from enjoying a good read. In the case of the Assassin and the mute Virgin and their escape to the wolves, I am afraid I've got the point, and I think those parts do not live up to the rest of Atwood's writing. Consequently, the book falls apart. Nevertheless, quite a great read, because the moment when you find out who did what to whom and why, that is the moment that makes reading this book so worthwhile.	2001-03-28

The story itself would have still been trite, but at least it wouldn't have taken so long to get through. There IS beautiful writing here, it's just stuck in a dull story with mostly dull characters.	2001-03-28

This insightful, layered work shows Atwood's thorough capability.  Although the jacked descriptions present a frame story combining past fiction with memoir, the structure of Blind Assasin is much more complicated.  Indeed, the interplay between past, present, memoir and fiction is meta-structural, as even the titles within the book are ambiguous and the divisions shift and dissolve without warning.<br />Atwood gives us a lot to love.  She has again brought forward compelling protagonists, female, as usual.  She has also conjured up antagonists of both sexes, typically shallow but not unrealistically so, given the novel's voice.  Atwood also sweeps through the twentieth century, concentrating on 1915, or so, through the end of World War II, rushing to the late 1990s where she deftly encapsulates the sensisiblities of an octogenarian amid donut shops, malls, cities, towns and the weather channel.<br />Her prose deserves attention.  Atwood writes homilies, proverbs, observations and literary allusions which make this slow reading.  But the time is well worth it, as the author's insight is razor sharp and her use of language nothing short of beautiful.<br />Don't stop at just one Atwood.  Read Cat's Eye and the Robber Bride.  Atwood's unflinching view of her characters and the dynamics between and among women is well worth it.	2001-03-15

The story would lose a lot in transition to the screen, I fear. Margaret Atwood's prose is beautiful. I couldn't help but read short passages to my wife aloud. There were times that I was confused, but the author carefully crafted my confusion. As I grew to know Iris' world view, I could anticipate her opinions, musings on aging, observations about modern culture. The running observations about public bathroom grafitti were perfect. I highly recommend this book.	2001-03-13

Even before Alias Grace, she has intrigued me by her eclectic writing abilities and captivating narration.<br />Now, this is not Alias Grace, her best work, and hence the 4 stars.  Nonetheless, I could not put this book down - and I have a lot of reading I have to get through!  Part history, part tragedy, part science fiction, this story has an &quot;epic&quot; nature to it as the story of Iris' tragic life unfolds.<br />This is a heavy book, leaving me with a sad feeling at the end; while there is some great witty humour in this book, you can see the ending coming like a rushing train, yet the impact is just as devastating emotionally.  During much of the book, one will wonder (unless you guess) why excerpts of this other book are in there, or, like me, you think they are in there for the wrong reason.  When the end does come, Atwood ties everything together quite snugly.<br />Which is perhaps my only criticism.  Aside from being a bit longish, I felt that, given some of the surprises at the end, the book was somewhat contrived.  Iris, the autobiographer of the story, deliberately leaves a major aspect of her life out, which of course is what tricks the reader at the end.  I am not sure if this is entirely credible, if Iris, as someone who wants to &quot;tell the real story&quot; as it were, would really do it this way.  You end up thinking it was Atwood's &quot;trick&quot; to make the story have a twist; and in so doing, it feels less like Iris' biography and more like the real author (Atwood) pulling the strings.<br />With that said, this does not detract from the reality that this is an excellent book, one of Atwood's best.<br />Read and enjoy!	2001-03-09

Ms. Atwood waves a very complicated plot around a story the point of which does not become clear, because the characters and their motives do not become clear. Before our eyes, great disasters take place, 2 World Wars, the rise and decline of a small town dynasty, secret love, arranged marriages, an abortion, the social upheavals of the twenties, the Big Depression... and yet it does not reach us because all that is important in this story, is not told, not directly. We do not know Alex, for example, what his motives are, what exactly he is running away from, does he love Iris, what does he think? We can suppose he is afraid, in love, an anarchist, a murderer, a rebel... We do not learn about Laura, what really happened between her and Richard. We can suppose she is sad, lonely, special... We do not know anything at all, in fact, about Iris herself, because nearly until the end, she does not participate in what surrounds her, she only reacts, never acts. It is very strange, for example, that she should have been stupified to the point of letting others shut her sister away without even the wink of protest. We can only suppose she is conformist, intimidated, frightened, in love, confused... Instead of reading about the real tings, we only read about what happenes around, before and after them. Laura is - supposedly - raped by her brother in law, but we only see her not eating and taking her coffee outside, to put just one example. I fail to see the point in this technique when the real events must have been immensely touching and interesting.	2001-02-19

You're in your late twenties, you're married to one of the most powerful industrialists/politicians in post-war Canada (although you're now living apart), and your beautiful Harpy sister has just died in a mysterious road accident.  So what do you do?  You publish your sister's first and only novel, and watch as the vultures descend...<br />  Margaret Atwood's Booker prize-winning novel is long and difficult to digest, a veritable seven-course meal.  It's taken me a long time of reading and rereading to get my angle upon it.  From the start, everything seems relatively straightforward.  You know what happens to whom, and where and when they died.  The rest of the novel explores have they got there.  However, what's most interesting about this narrative is that it does stray from the path, and ventures into the Wild Woods. When Atwood won the Booker, she poignantly praised the work of Angela Carter, which resounds in a small paragraph in the novel: &quot;All stories are about wolves&quot;.  The Blind Assassin is very much a work of magic realism.  You need to have some background reading, starting off with Dante's Inferno, especially Canto XIII.  The Wood of the Suicides features the Harpies, and I believe these are symbolic of Laura's supposed 'hysteria'.  Harpies are also known as 'The Robbers', and Laura is a notorious klepto.  Iris (the name of our narrator) was also sister to the Harpies in myth.  The two young heroes in the pulp novel have to enter a wood that supposedly has terrifying dead women in it.  Laura is symbolised by the suicide of Dido from the Aeneid.  There's also the glorious Book of Daniel, which recounts how Babylon fell overnight (which resounds in the pulp novel too, including the victorious Assyrians' Code of Hammurabi).  Allied to this is the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, translated by Edward Fitzgerald: &quot;The Moving Finger writes&quot; quote is a direct link to the Book of Daniel and the Fall of Babylon.  Add to these ingredients a generous helping of the Pre-Raphaelites and Alfred Lord Tennyson, and you've got the kind of novel that I love.<br />  No doubt this will sound pretty daunting for your average reader (I've compiled a page concerning the context of this novel for interested readers).  However, I think most people will be able to enjoy this novel without all these references.  On the other hand, Margaret Atwood makes a big assumption that lots of people will know what the Depression was like in Canada.  Unfortunately, Roosevelt and his New Deal are far more famous internationally than the ruthless 'Iron Heel' of Canadian Prime Minister Richard Bennett.  Canada had a devastating Depression in the &quot;Hungry Thirties&quot;, which was only fuelled by Bennett's policy of setting up forced work camps.  This suffering made more people rally to the Communist Party of Canada under the leadership of Tim Buck, and led to organised protests, such as the Ottawa Trek.  This was also the time of the 'Red Scare', the violent repression of 'pinkos' in North America.  It's worthwhile looking up the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti, and the deportation of Emma Goldman in order to really appreciate Alex's flight.  Alex symbolises the many Canadian Communists who fought in the Spanish Civil War.  However, Iris and Laura are cocooned in Avilion, and you don't really get to see anyone starving in The Blind Assassin to get any sense of this context, so probably Alex's cause is lost on a lot of readers.<br /> The only fault of the novel is openly acknowledged within Laura's narration: &quot;I've failed to convey Richard, in any rounded sense.  He remains a cardboard cutout.&quot;  Due to the plot of the novel, Richard's most significant actions are always clandestine, off-camera.  The only factual error I can find in the novel also revolves around him: &quot;He was a frequent participant in the Pugwash conferences,\\" we're told in his obituary at the beginning of the novel.  Yet Richard died in 1947, and the Pugwash Conferences started in 1957 - the only way that Richard could have attended would have been as a manifestation of Banquo.  Since the Pugwash Conferences were devised to bring around world peace, Richard (who's profited so much from his pugilistic attitude and the Second World War) seems a most unlikely candidate for membership.  Margaret Atwood can't have too much of a liking for the legendary King Arthur on this evidence, but it's poetic justice that Richard's Excalibur is thrown away, never again to see the light of day.<br />  All in all, this is a very enjoyable novel, and Atwood deserves the Booker prize (even if I think Matthew Kneale's English Passengers is slightly better).  John Buchan, author of The Thirty-nine Steps, makes a cameo appearance towards the end in his more formal role as Lord Tweedsmuir, Governor General of Canada at the start of the fall of the British Empire.  The narrative also concerns the Fall of the House of Chase.  Norval Chase commits an unforgivable act of patriarchy when he sees the writing on the wall, and submits his daughter to the veil.  Just like Belshazzar, he cannot avoid his fate, especially when faced with the mercurial Richard Griffen as adversary.  Laura finally finds her voice after years of numbness, but at what price?

There are many reasons why this is so; the main reason for me is that it have not still left me. I have read it but I am not finished with it. <br />It is a bit hard to read, its complex, so not a book for those who likes just easy stories that starts on A and ends on Z. One of thereasons for this is that the Blind Assassin is two stories that are entwined and which makes the reading a bit different from normal A-Z stories. In one part of the story we follow a couple of sisters and there life, in the second we are presented for parts of a famous novel written by one of the sisters. Confused? Well then, is not often life itself confusing. But could you state; do we want the novels we read to be confusing as well? And I would have to respond, no, but likewise if all novels were straightforward A-Z, where would the mystery be, the complexity, the compelling and mesmerizing stories where you do not end the book when you finish the last pages. <br />Atwood has delevered a very strong story that should be read carefully all the way to the end. I had to halt my reading midway and let my hardcover copy lay for 5 weeks (I did not want to drag it along travelling)but picked it up whan back home and it was as if I had hardly been away from it. So, its obviosly not that complicated. I advice you to be commited and take the time to savor her descriptions and her voices as a journey through someone's life. If you do have interruptions, be reassure that you won't lose the thread of the storyline. <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone! You won't regret it. And I haveadded Atwood to my list over great Canadian writers alongside Robertson Davis and Timothy Findley.	2001-01-27

The Blind Assassin is such a novel.<br />The story is rather complicated.  It involves the lives of two Canadian sisters in the 1920s through 1940s, as told by the elder sister (Iris) in her twilight years (late 1990s) ... and as related by a novel, The Blind Assassin, a cult feminist novel which made the younger sister (Laura) into a martyr.  The story is told at first in a rather straightforward fashion.  However soon one realises that information is being withheld and, most enjoyably, the reader becomes a sleuth.<br />I was especially pleased with Margaret Atwood's powerful prose; she seemingly cannot write a bad sentence.  And she has improved over time.  While somewhat an 'apples and oranges' comparison, The Blind Assassin is technically a much more mature, sophisticated novel than The Handmaid's Tale (..which is also well-worth reading).<br />Bottom line: absolutely brilliant.  Aspiring authors should read this before making a career decision (..once you read The Blind Assassin you'll probably be both over-awed, and depressed at the thought of trying to match this great literary work).	2001-01-18

At the epicenter lies the memories of an octagenarian, Iris Griffen, a woman haunted by her past, by regret and a sense of guilt, determined to leave a written testimony to her granddaughter Sabrina.  Iris is the product of an insulated and odd childhood, victim of the circunstances but often to be blame for her complacency.  The second story is a posthumously novel &quot;The Blind Assassin,&quot; an account of a love affair between a rich upper class woman and a socialist agitator who is running from authorities.  On a third level, within &quot;The Blind Assassin,&quot; there is a pulp science ficton novel.  Sounds strange and complex, but it is up to the reader to face this puzzle.  The writer will provide clues, but this foreknowledge enlightens and at the same time distorts.  With no logical time sequence and taking loops back and forth, the reader has to do some thinking to find the answers.  The outcome might come as a surprise, as a dissapointment, or a downright confirmation of what was already expected.<br />In this tapestry of memories there are several characters:  a caring mother who dies when Iris is 9 years old, a baffling and melancholic sister, a distant and authoritarian father, an ambitious and unscrupulous husband, and a spiteful sister-in-law.  The setting is Southern Ontario, in a world of &quot;fake morals&quot; and rigid class structures.  The time spans from 1920 to 1950, with major events taking place, WWI, Depression, Civil War in Spain, and the McCarthy era of communist hunting.<br />Margaret Atwood is a prolific writer, and &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot; as well as her previous work has a feministic overtone.  With her typical dark humor and irony Atwood writes a novel of human frailties, family secrets, sibbling rivalry, wealth and power, political and gender conflicts.  The moral might well be to what extent, despite prevailing circunstances, are we to be held responsible for our actions.	2001-01-16

Once I figured out which stories belonged where and to whom, I was very comfortable with the style. Of course, Iris is in all three...the SciFi story which I didn't care for and skimmed briefly when it reared its head (matter of taste,) the illicite love affair that went on for many years as a separate element, and, finally, the story of the lives of Iris and her sister.<br />I found the book to be gripping and I really wanted to find out what was going to happen next. At the heart, it was a mystery and we didn't find out who did what till almost the last page. And then it was a bit of a shock...well maybe not to us, but to Iris.<br />Margaret Atwood has a way of giving her characters such depth, which is what makes her books win awards and sell millions of copies. I was enthralled with Alias Grace, another mystery, and hoped that Blind Assasin would be as entertaining. I wasn't disappointed.<br />The book seemed to garner some bad reviews when it first came out and I wasn't sure if I should buy it, but I can't pass up a Margaret Atwood Novel. I knew it would be worthwhile.	2001-01-11

Big Deal.<br />Atwood is a sharp writer and has a catchy turn of phrase, but her characters are so vicious or appallingly weak that you really don't care at all what becomes of any of them. <br />Worst is Iris, who despite having a galaxy of personal battles to fight, sits on the sidelines and twiddles her little thumbs and lets other people do the living for her.

I've been addicted to Atwood since I was in Junior High (I'm now mostly done with an MA in Literature).  I'm beyond hooked on Alias Grace--I've read that novel at least once a year since it came out,last year I taught it in my Freshman Composition class--and everytime I read that book, I find something new that holds onto me and brings me back again (usually a question that I wrestle with for months after each reading).  I'm going to confess right off the bat that I'd read anything of hers, regardless of the critical drubbings it received, and find something in it to defend.  <br />That said, The Blind Assassin is no Alias Grace.  <br />By this I mean--I was sooooooooooooooooooooooooo disappointed in the ending!  a) I figured it out pretty early on, and was excited by the idea, but b) how cheap can you get, coming right out and GIVING your audience the answer that way?  Last spring it took me MONTHS to convince my students that the fact that there's so much you still don't know at the end of Alias Grace is one of the most brilliant and provocative parts of the novel.  And ten months later, Atwood comes out with a book which basically tells them that they were right, that we do need easy answers, that we oughtn't have to think for ourselves and interpret things (god forbid) because we've got novelists to do it for us??? I feel like this is a personal affront. . . (kidding).<br />On the plus side, it's not The Edible Woman either.   Atwood is constantly changing and growing as an author (inevitable, when your first novel is published in your early 20's), and her work here is much fuller and richer than it was in many of the early books (the fact that the clunky and heavy handed Handmaid's Tale will always be revered as her magnum opus makes me want to retch). The prose is phenomenal, the story engaging, I loved the part where Iris writes the letters back to scholars enquiring about &quot;Laura's&quot; book (that one hit home!), her tales of learning to navigate Richard and &quot;Freddie,&quot; the way the pieces fell into place gradually.  The oft maligned &quot;novel w/in a novel&quot; is what really haunts me about the book, and what will (probably) send me back to it sooner rather than later.  <br />If nothing else, it's worth having for the gorgeous cover.  I don't know if this will join the once-a-year-crew (Grace, Robber Bride, Cat's Eye, Lady Oracle), but my copy is going to see some mileage.	2001-01-03

Like some others, I bought this great book, then set it aside because of negative reviews.  That was a big mistake, because The Blind Assassin is a great book and well deserves the plaudits it is now receiving.<br />I won't review the plot, but have a couple of observations.  <br />First, Atwood continues to establish herself as one the great stylists of the English language.  Like writers such as John Le Carre and Charles Frazier, Atwood clearly loves the English language.  She writes sentence after sentence after sentence of thoughtful, beautifully crafted prose.  Every word is well considered and suited to the sentence, to the plot and to the mood.  If, like me, you stand in awe of those who can consistently create well crafted sentences, you will love everything Atwood writes.<br />Second, there are a lot of messages in this complex book, but one &quot;universal&quot; message struck me more than any other. Late in the book, Iris remembers a moment in the attic when she and Laura were doing some homework prescribed by their execrable tutor Mr. Erskine.  Laura then laments that their earlier tutor &quot;Miss Violence&quot; was gone.  Then this brief exchange.  First Iris:  &quot;So do I.  I wish we had Mother back.&quot;  Then Laura:  &quot;So do I.&quot;<br />Whether intended or not, Atwood has written a parable of the pain that befalls children when the parent who could have made the difference in their lives is gone.  To a large degree, the tragedy of the lives of the Chase daughters stems back to the loss of their mother.  Every child deserves at least one loving parent to guide them to adult life.<br />But there is far more to this book than that.  After 100 pages, I was enthralled with the unfolding tragedy.  Atwood is worthy successor to Shakespeare in in her ability to present the agony of a great tragedy in the guise of a well told tale.	2000-12-30

You get what you ask for.&quot; Such are the vacant homilies that define the lives of Iris and Laura Chase, as they attempt to find structure in a confusing world. Their mother has died giving birth, their father drinks himself senseless, but at least they have a home. And a housekeeper, Reenie, their surrogate mother, the fount of endless aphorisms: &quot;Leave well enough alone. Thank God for small mercies.&quot; Nothing is as it seems in this new novel by Margaret Atwood. THE BLIND ASSASSIN is a story within a story, written in the phrases of the 30's and 40's, the Depression Era and World War II. Save the occasional tutor, Iris and Laura grow up in a museum of a house with minimal preparation for the world outside. When their father is on the cusp of losing his factory, a quiet deal is arranged with Industrialist Richard Griffen, a man with a hidden political agenda. Upon Mr. Chase's death, which is imminent, ownership of the Chase Factory is passed along to Mr. Griffen, along with the hand of the oldest daughter, Iris, 18, in marriage. The younger daughter, Laura, 14, is a purist and fervent idealist who chafes at the guardianship of the Griffen family after her father's demise. As the girls mature, circumstances separate their lives. Tragically, Laura is killed in a car crash. Accident? Maybe not. Iris Chase Griffen posthumously publishes a single book of Laura's, one that gains a multitude of fans for this tragic young author. As Iris shares these memories in her waning years, another tale is introduced, &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot;. This story unravels along with an ongoing affair of an idealistic young man and his married paramour. Each clandestine meeting hints at mystery, while the story is early science-fiction of the simplest kind. We find a renewed strength in Iris Chase Griffin; she is no longer malleable or passive. Certainly she is capable of exposing her own behavior, her part in this drama, with a stunning conclusion. Without the armor of self-delusion, Iris makes it clear that &quot;blind&quot; has many definitions indeed.n.

Actually that would be nigh-impossible, for it is so well layered, that it takes you in a journey and it cannot easily be dismissed if at all.<br />With this modern work, Ms. Atwood ranks herself along with Timothy Findley as one of the most brilliant nad disturbing Canadian literary masters of our time.	2000-12-29

You would think that after so much practice writing, Margaret Atwood would finally come through with a genuine sizzler.  A sizzler 'The Blind Assassin' is not.  It is more like a small, once white hot coal doused with with a gallon of water during a driving tropical rain storm. The stuff for potential is there in the novel but it just doesn't cut the mustard. Atwood likes to put in the literary descriptive details a la Edgar Allen Poe, she has adopted some kind of twisted emulation of William Faulkner's style it seems to me - the end result is a disturbed mish mash of Margaret Atwood's mental masturbation.  Grow up or give up Margaret.     If you want to read a five star version of &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot;, read Steven King's &quot;Insomnia&quot; - it is the best 1900's love story I've probably read in the last 10 years and yes, a genuine white hot sizzler.	2000-12-23

The narrator of the \\"Iris\\" sections sets herself the task to tell, thruthfully, the sad history of her family. As she progresses, however, she is forced to admit that she is leaving vital parts of the narrative out, as if they are just too painful to put into words. Even this she never fully admits to, as she repeatedly tries to relate events without becoming too involved. Yet she consistently fails in this attempt. By the end of the novel, when the \\"revelation\\" comes, most readers will have already guessed at it, but Iris herself chooses to leave out the details.<br />Underlying this untold story is the recurring image of a photograph cut in two. The photograph shows a man and a woman together, but where it has been cut, a disembodied hand intrudes. It is this hand, we come to realize, which is the true narrator.<br />Much has been said about the structural difficulties of this novel. Atwood's elliptical approach to the narrative might indeed seem to be a difficulty, but it is herein that the true greatness of the novel lies: the \\"novel within the novel\\", i.e. Laura Chase's \\"The Blind Assassin\\" harbours within it another novel, namely the science fiction story of the planet Zycron. Here mystical forces and wondrous beings engage in their struggles. These three narratives are interspersed by newspaper articles. All in all it is a tangled web. Through this tangled web, however, the reader is able to piece together the story Iris is not willing to tell. Without the complicated structure most of the meaning of the novel would have been lost.<br />It is, above everything else, one of the most complete and compelling accounts of the complicated business we call \\"life\\" I have ever read. As such, a mere retelling of the story would be futile. Using all her powers as both novelist and poet, Atwood has given us an insight into the essence of living against all odds. The imagery is often startlingly evocative, as the wry observations of the ageing Iris is juxtaposed with the raw sexaulity of the anoymous lovers from Laura's novel, which is again juxtaposed with the alternatively magical, cruel, beautiful and sad imagery of the science fiction story. <br />The novel leaves one emotionally drained. Often provoking out-loud laughter and often eliciting wry smiles, it remains a desperately sad work about loss and unfulfilled promise. It is a giant of a book and without any doubt one of the greatest novels I have ever read.	2000-12-15

It's a great combination of a good pop-novel story to keep you turning the pages, and artistic merit with regard to originality of story and development of character. This is probably her best work, combining erotic family issues, sci-fi and social issues.  Placing a novel within the novel would seem like pretentious showing off were it not done so well.

Someone mentioned in one of my clubs that this book was really two stories entwined together throughout the book and I thought, oh geez, I'm going to have to do a lot of backtracking just to keep everything straight. Actually, it flows together beautifully with a twist at the ending ~~ almost as if Atwood was tying up the loose ends of the stories with a bow. You finish the book with a sigh and being totally amazed at Atwood's prowess with words. If you don't have a lot of interruptions, then take the time to savor her descriptions and her voices as a journey through someone's life. If you do have interruptions, reassure that you won't lose the thread of the storyline. You can pick up just where you left it at and become immersed into the story again.

Atwood's writing style has always been lyrical as in her other novels such as The Handmaid's Tale and Alias Grace. The newest one The Blind Assassin is not only a feast for the literary senses. It's also unique in its structure.<br />This structure is a novel within a novel. Iris Chase Griffen narrates the main novel by telling the events which surround and cause her sister Laura Chase to write a smaller novel called &quot;The Blind Assassin&quot;. With newspaper clippings and The Blind Assassin in excerpts, Iris tells of her and Laura's lives and their repercussions in a letter to her estranged granddaughter. Her narration which is set mainly in the first half of the twentieth century portrays the limited roles of women at that time especially well-to-do women. Supporting characters include the sisters' father Norval Chase whose downfall puts them into the hands of scheming brother and sister Richard(who becomes Iris' husband) and Winifred Griffen. World Wars I and II figure into the politics of the novel as well as the fight between communism and democracy.<br />I wish I could write as well as Atwood so that I can properly do her justice in this review. She just has amazing psychological insights; she delves into the subjects in a poetical way. Although her writing style may be obtuse at times, the readers should stick with it so they can have their own epiphanies while reading, that a-ha feeling readers get from great literature.<br />Of course, it's not perfect. The only complaint I have is that the sister's novel is not as compelling as the rest of the book. But that still doesn't detract from the fact that Margaret Atwood is one of our best modern writers.<br />For more of my book reviews, check out the online review site epinions	2000-11-21

Well, she hasn't improved at all, unless you count her typing speed (although even that's probably owed merely to more advanced technology).  Atwood as always presents a completely miserably, downtrodden life, where the characters have no hope for redemption, let only a chuckle.  Whereas other writers with bleak views at least give the reader bones like wit (Martin Amis), raunch (Charles Bukowski), or poetry (Alice Munro), Atwood just serves it up bland and humorless.  Call me again in another 20 years.	2000-11-14

In The Blind Assassin, Atwood revels in stylistic gymnastics and utterly abandons her readers.  This novel is not so much complex as it is unecessarily complicated. Since the publication of Alias Grace, Atwood has shown a marked tendency to write with the Booker in mind.  I am sincerely happy that she has been recognized by the Booker jury, but not for this particular effort.This book is so interminably unapproachable and, at points, staggeringly dull, that I fear I will never read Atwood again.	2000-11-10

Not having read the other nominees, I can't compare, but the announcement that \\"The Blind Assassin\\" by Margaret Atwood has won this year's Booker Prize, I am not surprised.  Atwood, having already written over a dozen novels, poetry, children's books, and some non-ficition, comes through with her latest in grand manner.  A prolific writer she is indeed.  That said,  \\"The Blind Assassin\\" is an adventure--not to mention quite an ambitious undertaking--to read.  Included in her convoluted plot line is a \\"novel within a novel\\" (see Reginald Hill's \\"Arms and the Women\\"!)--so be prepared to pay attention.  Atwood's style of writing, however, is anything but convoluted; it is straight forward, but complicated,  with expertly created characters.<br />The book is told by Iris who recounts her sister's death in Toronto in 1945, when she drives her car off a bridge.  The inquest indicates that the death is accidental. Then Atwood introduces us to her \\"novel within a novel\\" entitled \\"The Blind Assassin.\\"  Told by a pair of anonymous lovers, the book stretches into science fiction--absorbing on its own as an intriguing story!  What seems amazing about this work is the expert craftsmanship that Atwood possesses (and presemts),  although, given her reputation, that is not surprising. She also captures the 1930s-40s atmosphere quite well, too! The novel is tiered, and the author explores each level, one by one, until the final pages.<br />With her themes of greed, love, and  (inevitably) revenge, the story is right out of the Greek tragedies (well, actually, not, as \\"tragic\\" is not really exploited!).  Be prepared to spend some time with this work--but it will be time well spent.  What an intriguing novel! (Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)	2000-11-08

Now that I've finished the book, I find myself puzzled by some of the effusive praise in these reviews. I didn't have any trouble with the complexity of the material or the combining of the three layers of the book. In fact, I looked forward to the switching back and forth. I really liked the juxtaposition of newspaper articles with Laura's novel. These articles crisply and easily set the time and place and moved the plot along.<br />The book starts entertainingly and ends pretty powerfully. The tale within a tale within a tale is bizarre, sci-fi fun. The tale within the tale is dark and often intriguing, but the tale itself is often simply dull. There were moments I set the book down and had a hard time motivating myself to pick it up again. It is at times extremely slow-going. Compared with the classic &quot;The Handmaid's Tale,&quot; which was tense and thorough and impossible to put down, this one is imminently put-downable until the last 100 pages or so.<br />Margaret Atwood is obviously a great literary figure, but here she needed a really good editor who wasn't afraid to rein her in and point out some seemingly self-indulgent or misdirected effort. But her considerable talent does shine through -- there is often a poetic, lyrical use of words here -- some of her phrasing is so poignant it made me stop and read it over and over. For the lover of words, the book is well worth your time. But plot-wise there is no love here -- the emotion, that is. It's really depressing -- and cold. No excitement, no passion. Yet, when all is said and done, once I had finished the book I knew I had finished SOMEthing. It was hefty. It was literature. I am grateful for the experience.	2000-11-06

I have read several of Margaret Atwood's novels and I would undoubtedly classify this as her best.  Atwood pulls off an odd blend of science fiction, family expose, social commentary and the relationship of two sisters with aplomb. The format of a novel within a novel reflects the bold originality of this novel. Atwood stirs up a mixture of emotions throughout the novel and all of the characters are richly drawn and open for inspection by the reader. This novel always leaves you guessing up until the very last chapters.  Do not listen to those who claim the ending is weak! The ending is the strongest component of the novel and it wraps up the novel both as a mystery and as a family drama perfectly.	2000-10-31

What Margaret Atwood does here is the equivalent of doing a jigsaw puzzle--or, more to the point, fashioning a mosaic--while walking across Niagara Falls on a tightrope. Without a single misstep, she takes the reader back and forth between newspaper articles, an erotic and fanciful novel-within-a-novel, and an old lady's final memoirs to tell the mysterious, haunting story of the Chase sisters, Iris and Laura. The structure--despite the constantly shifting viewpoint--is rock-solid, the writing precise and poetic; Atwood hammers in the final piece of the mosaic--at which point, and only then, the final picture becomes clear--with an almost audible sigh of satisfaction at a job well done. &quot;The Blind Assassin'' is a model of the novelist's craft, combining the propulsive, page-turning pleasure of any bestseller with the moral seriousness and attention to language that readers demand of high art.	2000-10-29

If this book doesn't win the Booker Prize, then Margaret Atwood will never get to give Thomas Mallon his much-deserved comeuppance for the snide review he wrote of it for the New York Times Book Review.  Because I respect Mallon and have enjoyed more than one of his books, I took this review to heart (fool that I am), wasting several weeks before discovering for myself how much fun I've been missing out on!  Perhaps, however, Mallon was just playing the role of \\"The Blind Assassin\\" when he wrote it.<br /><br />Because of the number of excellent plot summaries already posted here, I'll save the space and not repeat them.  Atwood's female characters here are as complex and intriguing as they are in Cat's Eye.  Her descriptions are so specific that every aspect of the setting comes vibrantly to life, and it is easy to imagine every detail (yes, even the much maligned simile of a loaf of bread as bland-tasting \\"as an angel's buttock\\").<br /><br /> The plot evolves on three distinct, but parallel, planes, giving a triple whammy to Atwood's themes, while several different time frames keep the story full of mystery and excitement.  Best of all,  Atwood brings all the threads of the story together for a truly thrilling, rock 'em, sock 'em grand finale.  If you've been wondering why the odds are so good that Atwood will win the Booker, read the book.  This will certainly NOT be a consolation prize!  Mary Whipple	2000-10-23

I originally read &quot;Blind Assassin&quot; on a half-joking dare from a friend, no fan of Margaret Atwood's, who challenged me to figure out &quot;in 100 pages or less, what mind-altering substance [Atwood] was using when writing this book.&quot;  I've now read the thing twice through, and while &quot;Blind Assassin&quot; does have a number of brilliant plot twists and insightful points that make it worth reading, it also has a very disjointed, jarring style that makes it on the whole very difficult to follow.  Yes, it reads like an acid trip on paper; yes, it is a great novel.  (Bear with me, I'll explain the dichotomy in a moment.)<br />The book, like most of Atwood's work, has a rather Gothic overtone to it; central to the plot are the machinations and trials of a decaying upper-class Toronto family.  We see this fall from four different viewpoints at once:  that of young Iris Chase, heiress of a failing provincial manufacturing family; that of old Iris Chase-Griffen, writing memoirs of a life of familial and marital struggles (to put it lightly); that of Iris Chase writing as Laura Chase in the titular (and autobiographical) novel &quot;The Blind Assassin,&quot; a tale of sordid love affairs and pulp fiction; and that of the Toronto print media through a series of newspaper and magazine clippings. <br />Though each plotline has some superficial connection to the others, there is never any effort made to link them, and I found myself rereading the book in tiny segments, jumping from chapter to chapter to follow each of the plotlines.  The book's endings (all four of them) seemed forced, and the &quot;last&quot; ending gives the reader a very eerie sense of looking through a dead woman's eyes.  This book requires far more effort to read than it should (look at Atwood's outstanding works &quot;Alias Grace&quot; and &quot;The Handmaiden's Tale&quot; for comparison), but then again nobody ever accused Atwood of writing Pablum for the masses.<br />That said, the book did have a number of bright points.  I loved the acerbic commentary from old Iris on the state of our mass-produced, overhyped world, and I found much of young Iris and Laura's conversations about life, death and God to be wonderfully thought-provoking.  I also enjoyed the mini-mystery over the real paterrnity of Iris' daughter, and the portrayal of partners in crime Richard and Winifred Griffen was just twisted enough to nauseate without totally repelling.  They're not quite as good as, say, a Richard III or an Iago, but they are a nice modern study of psychosis in power.<br />The first time I read &quot;Blind Assassin&quot; through, I rated it a 1 on my 5-star scale.  The second time, I rated it 5.  I split the difference for this review, but this book really isn't one you can average out.  Either you'll love it or you'll hate it... it all depends on your point of view.	2000-10-22

The ravaged social terrain of their childhood, shadowed by their thrice-wounded father, veteran of the trenches, and their mother's quick decline to death, is contrasted with the privileges &amp; prominence their slowly-eroding wealth once purchased. Iris is married off to a prominent industrialist to save what's left; Laura, the literal-minded idealist, comes to identify with the powerless workers in her father's factory, and draws her sister into concealing Alex Thomas, a radical who survives by writing pulp science fiction, during the labor unrest which rocks their town. With his lover, he spins out a science fiction yarn during their trysts, a parable of of the destructive social conditions around them, and which becomes the seedbed for her book.      The eyes and voice of the elderly Iris provide the vision of present-day Toronto, which, like her own body, show the ravages of the avarice which consumed the life of her husband, her daughter, and her sister, and leave her, like Ishmael, alone to tell the tale.     Despite its 521 pages and its appearance of digressiveness on the narrator's part, the book is elegantly structured and concise.	2000-10-13

The gymnasium at this time was called the Red Center. In the Red Center there were women who could bear children, such as Kate. These women are taught to be handmaids. Handmaids are to stay at a house, go through a religious ritual with the man of the house and his wife and bear a child for them, given that the wife may be sterile.  Kate is assigned to the Commander's house. The day she arrives, the Commander's Wife, Serena Joy, establishes very understandable rules, such as no talking or any type of contact with her husband. Kate is given another name, Offred, and a room to herself. She must wear a red dress and a hat to cover her face. Offred may not talk to any man nor have any form of relationship with a man. This foreshadows what will happen later on.  As days go by, the first ritual arrives. The Commander and his wife are in the living room with Offred. After reading from the Bible and saying a prayer, the three enter the Commander's bedroom and go through the procedures that need to be done. The ritual is brutal yet the three must do it.   One night when Offred was sneaking around the house, Nick, the Commander's chauffeur caught her by surprise. Nick kissed Offred, for there is some feeling between the two, and reported to Offred that the Commander wanted to see her secretly in this office the next night. Subsequently, he left. This incident is another one of the many rising actions.  The following night Offred went to the Commander's office. This is also another rising action. Unknown of what to expect Offred finally knew why he wanted her there. The Commander wanted to befriend her. In doing so, the Commander played Scrabble, allowed her to read magazines, and after many visits, he gave her some hand lotion. Then one night, the Commander took Offred out to a private club, Jezebel. Then, the succeeding occurrence leads to the climax. The Commander takes Offred to a room and reveals her how true sexual intercourse is.  Some time later, Serena Joy discovers what Offred has done by realizing there was lipstick on the clothes that Offred wore at Jezebel, which actually belonged to Serena Joy. This, personally, is the climax. Offred, unknown of what will be done to her now awaits in her room.  Finally, the Eyes's van pulls up in the driveway. The Eyes are the secret police of Gilead, but these Eyes differ. These Eyes are rebels in disguise. This is the falling action. Nick is also part of these rebels and informs Offred to go with them. Offred leaves in the van and escapes with Nick. The Commander and his wife are left open-mouthed for they did not call the Eyes. This is the resolution of this novel.	2000-10-11

Her prose sucks the reader into the story, into the hearts and lives of her characters, and doesn't spit one out again until long after the last page is turned. I finished the book more than a week ago, yet I still find myself mulling over episodes and wishing I was still in the thick of the story. My only complaint is that I guessed the &quot;twist&quot; too soon--and I'm a fanatic about not guessing the end; I never look for clues, prefering the story rather to unfold so that I can pick up on those clues at a later reading. In the Blind Assassin, clues are plentiful--even once the twist is guessed--and perhaps too much so. Regardless, this is a stunning piece of fiction and highly recommended.	2000-10-06

Margaret Atwood continues to write stories that are...well, different, one from the other.  The style in this book is so different from A Handmaid's Tale, or Alias Grace, but as usual, the writing and characters are excellent.<br />The story starts after World War II ends, when Laura, the narrator's younger sister, commits suicide by driving off a bridge.  We are drawn into the story through a series of article clippings about the social life of the surviving sister, Iris; her pompous husband and nouveau riche sister-in-law; and the posthumous publication of Laura's science fiction novel (The Blind Assassin).<br />These articles are tucked between Iris' reflections on her life then and now, along with a running third party story between a woman and her lover, who tells her the original tale of The Blind Assassin.<br />We move back and forth in time, retracing the history of the Canadian sisters from the 1920s to 1999, in a way that makes this novel difficult to put down, a pleasure to return to.  A little mystery, a little steamy romance, some socialism, and sibling rivalry combine to make this book (as with all of Atwood's books) more than just something to read.  Iris, especially, is so human in her old age, her sins are easy to forgive.<br />The ending is a bit of a let down -- I'd figured out most of it before I was halfway through the book -- but the enjoyment of reading and being able to take all the threads and see them come to tie together was well worth the read.<br />A very good read for Atwood fans.	2000-10-03

It is a mystery, with a death, but it is not a &quot;mystery novel&quot; as we come to expect.  The Blind Assassin is the story of two sisters:  Laura and Iris Chase.  Laura died in what may or may not have been a suicidal car crash in 1945.  Iris tells the story of her family and the events leading up to Laura's death, reflecting in the present on the events of the past.  What is so fascinating about The Blind Assassin is that things are not always what they seem, but there are layers upon layers of story, of truth.  Atwood reveals the story to us in many ways.  We see newspaper accounts of what happened to the Chase family.  These accounts are told with the confidence that they convey the whole, true story, but do they?  Then we hear Iris' story, but something is not right with her story, something is missing.  Iris admits that she has omitted crucial details and bit by bit, the reader is able to piece together what did happen.  Interspersed in Iris' narrative are excerpts from Laura's posthumously publised novel, The Blind Assassin, which also give us insight into what happened.  Atwood tells this story marvelously.  Iris' observations about the present day are witty and sharp.  Atwood kept me guessing right up until the end.  The mystery of this novel makes it just that much more fun to read.  The Blind Assassin is a wonderful addition to the body of work of one of the most talented living authors.  I highly, highly recommend it.	2000-09-25

I was disappointed when the plane touched down -- I wanted another 4 hours to finish the book.  I read the remainder on the return flight two days later.  It is just SO beautifully woven together.  Iris (the narrator)really knows how to spin this yarn out, and manages to create a wonderful dialogue with the reader of the entirety of the life she shared with her sister and its intrigue and deceipt.  Fabulous fabulous book.	2000-09-21

WWII has just ended and 25-year old Laura Chase has just driven off a bridge. Atwood then immediately takes us to Laura's sci-fi novel 'Blind Assassin,' published posthumously in 1947. As the novel within the novel unfolds, so too do the stories of Iris and Laura, WWI &amp; WWII, the labor movement, 1930's Toronto high society and much more.  Mystery, sci-fi and romance all wrapped up in one fantastic novel.<br />Atwood leaves a trail of crumbs that keep the reader hungry for more. I couldn't put it down. I must warn you though, if you're looking for a book that will leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy, this isn't the one. I've been in a gloomy mood since finishing it this morning. But, if you appreciate fine writing that leaves you thinking about life and human nature long after you've finished it, then you'll want to read Blind Assassin.	2000-09-18

While I  admired The Handmaid's Tale and adored Alais Grace, Cat's Eye and The  Robber Bride are two novels that I wish I had never read. I loathed them.  Needless to say, I was somewhat reluctant to buy the Blind Assissin. The  praise of her talents on the back of the jacket seemed a bit over  indulgent, and I have always felt that, like Virgina Woolf, Atwood is all  too aware of her powers and will go to great lengths to convince you that  she is, in fact, a great writer. She favors unconventional structures for  many of her novels (strange structures, even, that often jar the reader as  jumps are made between characters and perspectives.) Don't even get me  started on the frequently used (frequently mixed) metaphors which litter  her pages. Such elements are once again present in The Blind Assassin; this  time, however, the leap between different points of view (in this case  between Iris' musings and Laura's novel) never feels gimmicky or false. In  fact, The Blind Assassin moves smoothly from start to finish, and all of  the stories, articles, and reflections pull you deep into the lives of the  Chase sisters, and all are essential for the novel's unexpected conclusion.  It is positively engrossing (I missed the finals of the US Open while  reading this, grrr) and for the first time I began to realize that perhaps  Atwood was right all along: she is a great writer.	2000-09-18

What intrigued me about this novel were the various gimmicks (to use  reviewer David Eustace's term).  Without them, if the story had been  relayed in a chronological manner, all of the mystery and much of the  wonder would have been absent.  Ms. Atwood has given the reader several  challenges with this novel - what events and emotions shaped Iris as we see  at the end of her life?  Who are the mysterious lovers whose clandestine  meetings fill a third of the book?  What is the answer to the mystery of  both Laura's and Richard's disappearance?  And why is the story of the  blind assassin integral to the overall novel?  I loved putting the clues  together bit by bit as I read.  This book demands more from the reader than  most books, for it is a process that the author and the reader enter into  together - a process of readjusting suppositions and unraveling the  mysteries Ms. Atwood presents.  I only gave it four stars, however, because  I found the ending to be unsatisfying.  The buildup was much too complex  and powerful to be resolved in such ordinary answers.  Iris is, however, a  completely fascinating character and is well worth the time and effort the  reader spends to enter and understand her life.	2000-09-13

As such, I devoured her newest novel in  two sittings, despite its 500+ page length. It has left me feeling bleak  and, in the words of the book's narrator &quot;scraped clean inside.&quot;  This is a beautifully structured book, involving three (perhaps even four)  narrative layers that play off of each other to build a terrifying  commentary on love, passion, sisterhood (both the biological and, by  extension, emotional kinds), and betrayal. The book contains the closest  thing to a love story Atwood has ever written, and it's a harrowing one  that will sneak up on you and devastate you in the end. With the primary  action being set between WW I and WWII, the novel also offers a final  comment on the twentieth century: humanity's culpability in creating,  destroying, and creating again, and on the quiet moments of beauty that are  possible (temporarily) among the rubble.<br />This is a great book, a worthy  successor to the wonderful Alias Grace. Read it at your own emotional risk,  but READ IT.	2000-09-12

I generally enjoy  mystery/thriller books, however, I like to take a &quot;break&quot; and  sometimes read different type books.  I rely on Amazon's &quot;Movers and  Shakers&quot; and the &quot;Top Selling Books&quot; to help me select a new  book.  This is actually how I selected this book. I have somehow struggled  and read about 100 pages of this awful book.  I don't believe I am going to  torture myself any more by attempting to get through this 400 page boring  book.  <br />I do not recommend this book.  The book doesn't flow at all, it  is disjointed, too detailed and basically, horrible.	2000-09-12

Atwood has styled a fully  developed novel within a novel, and takes us through a lilting &amp;  genteel 30's/40's murder mystery and an elegantly erotic upperclass/lower  class tale intertwined with an engaging and ever shifting off-world science  fiction story.<br />The Blind Assassin's character development is played out  through survival techniques. Self-actualization is borne from denial; what  is obvious remains buried deep in the book's psyche. Atwood combines the  colloquial cadence of a post WW1 world with the lush fictions from that era  &amp; the mannerisms of anticipation inherent in pre-WW2 times.<br />This book  is a rare find. Unlike more predictable fiction it suspends real time and  space so thoroughly--the reader is likely to travel in a daze connected  directly to the storyline long after the last word has been read.	2000-09-12

This is a tender and poignant story of love, death,  family, and high society. All familys have secrets and family members often  turn a blind eye to them. This story is a rich study of family and of the  time it takes place. In beautiful language, Margaret Atwood takes the  reader on a twisting, dangerous road full of hairpin curves and sudden  obstacles. I loved the cliches of the '30's and the insights into high  society. A complicated, dense novel that packs and emotional wallop.	2000-09-12

US	51837691	RMJ355OOF5634	0385475721	850910906	The Blind Assassin	Books	4	5	8	N	N	Overflowing Novel	Like a great chef who wants to impress, but who adds too many ingredients  and spices to the p(l)ot, Atwood's new book has too many contents, and too  many voices at work. <br />For example, there is a narrative interrupted by  supposed newspaper extracts, and then by two people talking, that itself  turns into a plot, that contains a novel, also called The Blind Assassin.  Why? Were writer and publisher uncertain as to the material?  Why so many  gimmicks?<br />Still, this book keeps a reader turning pages, and some of its  many devices are fun. My test for a book that is gimmicky is to ask if the  story was in straightforward a-z manner, how would I rate it?  My reaction  might have been to rate highly the wonderful writing -- despite what the  New York Times says, her similes are fun -- but as to the plot, when all is  over --so what?	2000-09-08

Atwood has entertained and challenged  readers over the years with books like The Handmaid's Tail, Cat's Eye, The  Robber Bride, IMHO her best novels. The Blind Assassin is two tales in one.  The narrator is Iris Chase, the older sister of Laura Chase who, at the  start of the novel, drives her car off a very famous bridge in Toronto, an  apparent suicide. The novel carries on with Iris recalling the Chase  family's life, all three sisters are daughters of a button manufacturer  during the depression era. We see them as little girls, young teenagers and  then women, their lives unfold in an entertaining and sometimes humorous  fashion. At the same time we are given a science fiction story entitled The  Blind Assassin written by the character Laura Chase. The Sci Fi story  harkens back to The Handmaids Tail, a strange society where there are two  classes divided and a very strange love affair going on. Sounds complicated  right?  This is a book you have to stick with and as you move through the  story, the characters and their stories will grow on you.  This is not my  favourite Atwood novel, it was clearly a huge challenge for her to write  but in the end I felt it was a winner and will not dissapoint her fans.	2000-09-07

Margaret Atwood crafts her words so perfectly and beautifully that you feel as though you're sucked into the scene and watching it happen as a bystander.<br />On the surface, a description of this novel might seem boring i.e The reminiscing of an old woman if her childhood days, almost her autobiography interjected with snippets of her current daily life. And yet, it is one of the most thrilling and captivating books I've read. You almost cannot wait to delve back into her world and hear her stories.<br />They follow her younger self and her sister, her father, the war, the revolution, a forbidden affair and, placed throughout, the creation of a novel called &#34;The Blind Assassin&#34; by a young rogue and his lover.<br />I love her style of writing, her ability to make what could be a mundane topic exhilarating and the beautiful way she crafts the story so vividly that you could be there.	2015-06-27
