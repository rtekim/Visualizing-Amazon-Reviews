It is Hammett’s first novel involving the Continental Op and it is dark, gloomy, and as hardboiled as it gets.  There are other hardboiled novels that feature a detective or other person coming into a corrupt town and trying to solve a murder when no one wants to help him and every hand is turned against him, but many such novels by Spillane, MacDonald, and Latimer came a decade or two after Red Harvest.  What’s remarkable about this novel is how tough, how unyielding, and how hardnosed it was.  It all takes place in “Personville” which the narrator describes as “Poisonville,” the ugliest town ever imagined both physically and metaphorically and even the dames in it are as hardboiled as they come, particularly Dinah, the toughest talking femme fatale ever imagined.

From Yojimbo's nameless Ronin to Fistful of Dollar's Man With No Name, and countless other films this novel inspired an archetype for both an action hero and invented one in the world of noir detectives. This may be the original Man with No Name, but it is also the original Private Eye first person narration.<br />  Hammet's Red Harvest is a brilliant story of a town owned by rival gangs. It is corrupt on every level. When the last honest citizen (a reformer) is murdered, the Continental Detective Agency sends in the &#34;Op&#34; to stir things up. The detective or operative (simply known as &#34;the Op&#34; ) is solving the case when he is asked to look into some corruption. At this point the Op plays both sides against each other in order to clean up the town in a &#34;red harvest.&#34;<br />  The storyline is tight. The characters are interesting, but what caught me was the wonderful descriptions. Hammett used to be a Pinkerton detective and had to describe a person for the teletype services in a limited amount of characters but with precise detail. This makes for a wonderful style of prose. This novel is one of the earlier examples of pulp noir. It has detectives, femme fatales, gunmen, corrupt police, all the tropes of the traditional pulp. If you enjoy this I would recommend The Maltese Falcon, The Dain Curse, and The Glass Key (all by Dashiell Hammett). I would also recommend any of the Philip Marlowe series by Raymond Chandler starting with The Big Sleep.",2014-09-23

If you are a local or just visiting, you can call it Poisonville. Steeped in corruption, this is a place that needs some cleansing. And the Continental Op is the man called to do just that. You can be sure that wherever the Op goes, there is a hail of bullets not too far behind.<br /><br />Hammet’s Red Harvest laid the groundwork and set the bar for many pulpish, hard-boiled crime novels. It also inspired many filmmakers to complete variations of its story, and many filmmakers have taken the blueprint for this story as a basis for their crime films.<br /><br />While I can see Red Harvest’s relevance and importance, and how its title comes to symbolize the amount of bloodshed and corruption within this fictional place, I thought it was somewhat a disappointing read in comparison to others in this genre. The pace is there, but you have to strain some credulity when trying to figure out this convoluted plot. Also, because of the novel’s fast-paced action, the characters are rather underdeveloped and serve just as a means to getting to the next part of the action.<br /><br />As far as the characters, there were way too many, with so many just being there to be soon bumped off a few pages later. Many of the thugs and unclean types from both sides were fairly interchangeable. By the end of the novel, it was difficult to figure out who killed who or why they did it. I did think that Dinah was an apt femme fatale, as she seems to know the ins and outs of Poisonville, maybe a little too well. Even the Op barely rises above the vermin he’s trying to take down.<br /><br />While Red Harvest effective in action and pacing, it is less so in mystery or build up. I know the Op is there to basically rid the corruption thatexists in Personville and cleanse the town without becoming “blood simple”, but the action and violence sort of plays out a little too over-the-top and becomes repetitive.<br /><br />In total, Hammett’s Red Harvest is dripping in booze, deception, double crosses, sucker punches and many, many bullets.

The book is very engrossing, and the reader on the audio version of the book hams up the quirky characters of the novel in a delightful manner.<br /><br />This is more than pulp fiction though less than literature.  Important themes lurk beneath the surface, including the hypocrisy of American life and the hopelessness of settling the score without getting very dirty. I do think that Hammett misses the point with his overly cynical rendition of the general weakness and venality of the human character.  People do a lot of evil things, but not always because of some innate imperfection as opposed to the relentless pressures of surviving in social institutions.  Hammett's characters tend to be caricatures as opposed to recognizable people who happen to do a lot of bad things.<br /><br />The moral code of the hero is only in part premised on the notion of upholding the core values that we all profess to live by.  The hero is Machiavellian at best, using a lot of dubious means to accomplish his professed higher ends.  But what seems to motivate the hero even more is the desire to show that he is no fool, knows what to do, and knows how to get by in a nasty world.  In a word, surviving-in-style is the ultimate end, though not the only end because he would have been better off just chucking things and leaving town when the leaving was good.<br /><br />A very absorbing and interesting book.",2014-05-05

Since there are dozens of reviews already posted here, I will take a different slant, citing how quotes from the 19th century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche apply to the novel's unnamed main character/narrator, a man simply known as `Continental Op' and the city where the novel is located, Personville aka Poisonville, a dingy mining city of 40,000 squeezed between two Northern California mountains.<br /><br />\\""Without music, life would be a mistake.\\""<br />There isn't one reference to music in the entire novel. Not surprising, since, from the perspective of music and the arts, this grimy berg run by gangsters, bootleggers, crooked cops and gritty thugs could be considered one colossal mistake. Of course, I'm not entirely serious, but imagining a Personville String Quartet playing an evening of Mozart at the town's public building would be belly-laughable. Not laughable, that is, for the townspeople, who would probably protest such music by riddling the musicians with bullets after playing the first few bars of their Mozart.<br /><br />\\""He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.\\""<br />The Continental Op is a private detective for a national agency; he's insulted, double-crossed, and has to listen to the lies and cons from the city's sleazy power-boys as well as dodge unending gunfire. All in a day's work as he goes about seeking revenge for being set up to be bumped off by Noonan, the fat chief-of-police. Such a `why `and `how' is the stuff of Hammett's riveting story.<br /><br />\\""The best enemy against an enemy is another enemy.\\""<br />This Nietzsche quote could have been used by Hammett as the novel's epigraph. The Continental Op sets gangsters, bootleggers, professional thieves, police and politicians all against one another. The result? Too many dead bodies to count. With dozens and dozens of murders, Red Harvest qualifies as a 200 page blood bath. But, please don't be put off by all the blood; fortunately, for lovers of great literature, this is great literature. Always good to keep in mind many works of great literature, for example The Iliad and Richard III are chock full of blood.<br /><br />\\""Ah, women. They make the highs higher and the lows more frequent.\\""<br />Meet Poinsonville's femme fatale: Dinah Brand. If you are a man and would like to pick lead out of your belly, hang around Dinah. Here is the Continental Op's reflections on meeting Ms. Brand for the first time, \\""She was an inch or two taller than I, which made her about five feet eight. She had a broad-shouldered, full-breasted, round-hipped body and big muscular legs. The hand she gave me was soft, warm, strong. Her face was the face of a girl of twenty-five already showing signs of wear. Little lines crossed the corners of her big ripe mouth. Fainter lines were beginning to make nets around her thick-lashed eyes. They were large eyes, blue and a bit blood-shot. Her coarse hair--brown--needed trimming and was parted crookedly. One side of her upper lip had been rouged higher than the other. Her dress was of a particularly unbecoming wine color, and it gaped here and there down one side, where she had neglected to snap the fasteners or they had popped open. There was a run down the front of her left stocking.\\""<br /><br />Those who fights with monsters must take care lest he thereby become a monster.\\""<br />Here is a quote from the Continental Op after taking the necessary steps in starting to clean up the city for his double-crossing client, old Elihu Willsson. \\""Look. I sat at Willsson's table tonight and played them like you'd play trout, and got just as much fun out of it. I looked at Noonan and knew he hadn't a chance in a thousand of living another day because of what I had done to him, and I laughed, and felt warm and happy inside. That's not me. I've got hard skin all over what's left of my soul, and after twenty years of messing around with crime I can look at any sort of a murder without seeing anything in it but my bread and butter, the day's work. But this getting a rear out of planning deaths is not natural to me. It's what this place has done to me.\\"" The Continental Op knows the truth of Nietzsche's words here from his own first-hand experience.<br /><br />\\""Of all that is written, I love only what a person has written with his own blood.\\""<br />Dashiell Hammett spent some years with the Pinkerton agency as a detective. He had a first-hand Poisonville-like experience in Butte, Montana where he probably had occasion to see his own blood in the line of service. So, if there ever was a book that could have been written with the author's own blood, Red Harvest is that book.nd after twenty years of messing around with crime I can look at any sort of a murder without seeing anything in it but my bread and butter, the day's work.

Hired thugs broke the strike then took over the town (Chapter 1). Donald started a reform campaign to clean up the town. The dirt was stronger. The next day the CO meets Donald's father Elihu Willsson the czar of Personville. He tells what he saw. Was Donald's wife involved? Elihu disapproved of Donald's policy. The CO investigates the newspaper (Chapter 2). Donald wrote a large check to Dinah Brand (Chapter 3). The CO talks to Chief of Police Noonan; they share facts. Widow Willsson explains.<br /><br />The CO visits Dinah Brand (Chapter 4). Why did she want that check certified? Knowledge of a future strike could allow a profitable investment. Dinah offered information for that money. The CO warns her. Early in the morning the CO gets a telephone call from Elihu; he wants the town cleaned up (Chapter 5). Also, a dead burglar was in his room. The CO visits the Chief, they plan a raid on Whisper's joint. They won't have to prove anything if he is shot resisting arrest. The CO learns a lesson as he enters the place (Chapter 6). The CO figures out who really shot Donald and the motive (Chapter 7). But there' more! There is a flurry of shots thru his hotel window. A warning to get out of town (Chapter 8)? Can a local boxing match be fixed (Chapter 9)? The CO learns about a hidden crime (Chapter 11). He gets a statement from a witness that will take care of Whisper (Chapter 12). A telephone from Dinah brings him there (Chapter 13). There is a surprise and conflicts. The other operatives arrive and will be put to use (Chapter 14). They travel to the `Cedar Hill Inn'.<br /><br />Dinah collects her fee (Chapter16). Chapter 17 tells about crime and punishment in Personville. As they motor to the \\""Silver Arrow\\"" they hear gunshots. There is a peace conference at Willsson's house (Chapter 19). Will this end the gun-work? A telephone call tells what happened to Noonan (Chapter 20). The events are summarized. There is another murder under the CO's nose (Chapter 21). There are new members to the police force (Chapter 22). He learns about another murder. A lawyer calls the CO with an offer to defend him. The next morning the CO finds another body (Chapter 23). A notebook has a clue, so too four letters. The newspapers reported the news (Chapter 24). How accurate was it? Reno and his boys go for a ride (Chapter 25). There is success, then complications. The CO visits Elihu Willsson and tells him to call the governor and ask for the national guard. Then he goes to look for a deserted warehouse (Chapter 27). Does it have bootleg whiskey? The next warehouse has bodies and a solution to one murder. The CO takes a vacation, and learns how the town was cleaned up under martial law. [Will the same conditions lead to the same problems?]<br /><br />The name \\""Personville\\"" is a generic name for all the towns named after a big land owner. Hired gunmen were brought in for strike-breaking, then took over the city. Machiavelli's Letter warned against a mercenary army: they can takeover the government that hired them. Only a citizen army is proper to a republic. Creating a militia of armed citizens could have put an end to these gangs, but they would gain political control. The 1877 strike in Pittsburgh's coal and iron industry led to the abolishment of the traditional local militia and its replacement by a state-controlled militia. Newly powerful corporations controlled state governments, the new \\""National Guard\\"" developed into a strike-breaking force with the power of law.",2013-08-13

Of course, when a reader of our time first approaches a book like this, one thinks it's full of cliches and commonplace, until one realizes that it's here where they were created, to be further copied to satiety and taken to film down to self-parody.<br /><br />A detective with the Continental Agency, known only as the \\""Continental Op\\"", has been summoned to the small mining city of Personville (otherwise known as \\""Poisonville\\"") by one Dan Willsson. But before he has the chance to meet the guy, Willsson is murdered. Without even knowing what the mission would have been, if eventually he had landed a contract, the Op focuses on solving the murder, which he quickly does. But so it happens that Willsson was the son of Elihu, the decrepit owner of the town. This Elihu seems to have lost control over his gangsters, who are now fighting each other for power. Taking advantage of the old man's confusion, the Op coaxes him into a contract with the objective of getting rid of the gang, during which the Op causes a bloody war. At the center of the intrigue is the seductive (but alcoholic, careless and greedy) femme fatale Dinah Brand. Her most recent conquest is a gangster with a speech disability which only allows him to speak in whispers, who is waging a particular war with the Chief of Police. The internecine fight soon escalates to a chaotic level, and amid the blood-spilling the Op must now, first and foremost, try to get out alive while figuring out if he himself has committed murder.<br /><br />Yes, a twisted and manic plot, told with short, dry sentences full of witty bravado, in a town where cynicism, corruption, and avarice are kings.

This is most definitely not a polite, parlor mystery where most of the blood is spilled off of the page. As the title suggests, this book is filled with mayhem and the bodies are falling left and right.<br /><br />The main protagonist is the Continental Op, who doesn't remotely resemble the genteel Hercule Poirot or any of the other fictional detectives who were so popular in the 1920s. The Op is certainly smart and skilled, but he's a squat, overweight man who's more than willing to cut whatever corners are necessary in order to achieve what he believes to be the greater good.<br /><br />The Op, who is employed by the Continental Detective Agency in San Francisco, is detailed to the Personville, a mining town known to most as Poisonville. The town was, for a long time, under the thumb of Elihu Willsson who owned the Personville Mining Corporation, the local newspapers, and a number of other businesses as well. He also controlled all of the politicians of any consequence, up to and including the state governor.<br /><br />During the First World War, Willsson had made whatever deals were necessary with the miners' unions to ensure that the company's operations were unimpeded. But once the war ended, he determined to break the unions and in doing so, invited in a number of thugs and crooks to assist him. The unions were effectively cowed, but the thugs and crooks stayed in town and carved out interests for themselves, effectively reducing Willsson's authority.<br /><br />As the book opens, Elihu's son, Donald, has asked the Continental Detective Agency for assistance. Elihu has now turned the town's newspapers over to his son and the son is something of a reformer. But before the Op can even meet with Donald, Donald is murdered. The Op believes that it is his obligation to identify the killer. As he attempts to do so, old Elihu Willsson offers the Op $10,000.00 to clean up Personville. In reality, he wants to get rid of the gangs that are competing for control of the town so that he can dominate it unchallenged once again.<br /><br />The Op is repulsed by the level of corruption in the town and by Elihu himself.

When you first start reading, you keep asking yourself why the Op stays in this corruptive village in the middle of nowhere. It's a mining town but it's filled with plenty of corruption. Everybody is corrupt even the narrator. The stories here were told in a serialized style for pulp fiction magazines for entertainment value.<br /><br />Is there literary value in pulp fiction, you bet there is with Dashiell Hammett who was the king of pulp fiction of his time period. He was a troubled author with alcohol problems, health, and his own demons of war and experiences as a Pinkerton detective. He was really trying to redefine the mystery detective genre.<br /><br />Unlike Sherlock Holmes, Jane Marple or Hercule Poirot, Op is unique in his voice. He's not necessarily evil nor good but shady and complicated. His character is never really defined nor do we do much about his character's history and background. He stays to clean up Personville.<br /><br />True to style, Hammett's writing includes plenty of references to alcohol during the prohibition time period which this book was written in the first place. It was published in 1926 at the height of prohibition where alcohol consumption and distribution was largely forbidden. Well, corruption ran rampant anyway.<br /><br />That's the morality tale here about corruption in a small town or any town over alcohol, power, money, etc. The characters here are thinly veiled and just mere caricatures of society's depiction of the time period.

An earlier reviewer said \\""blunt wit\\""--that's dead right.  Hammett can do more with fewer words than any writer I know--poetry but you never notice it.  Humor follows horror follows betrayal.<br /><br />His detective is unusual in belonging to a Pinkerton-type organization, and in other stories cooperates with the police, but here he systematically isolates himself by breaking all rules, betraying one ally after another, refusing to clear himself of suspicion, and generally inciting mass murder.  By the end he's driven away colleagues, his employer, gangster allies, his girlfriend [who he apparently has killed], and any semilegitimate forces such as the police.  He's very conscious he's doing this, and explicitly describes the bloodlusting cultural corruption that he is reveling in, feeding, steering, and using to clash and destroy itself.  He starts counting up the killings at one point, gets up to eighteen or 20, clearly is leaving some collateral damage out, but on he goes.  Initially, Hammett throws in examples of business corruption, police corruption, and gangsterism as everyday asides, but then as his detective undermines the prior balance of power, 'normal corruption' breaks down and the whole town feels the anarchy.<br /><br />Hammett remarkably demonstrates the power of account-giving skills:  his detective tells one story of a murder one time and causes one mob war, then gives a rival account to cause another murder.  He doesn't know the truth, but while searching for it he raises doubt that truth may even exist, as one more account emerges to fit every new cumulated and reinterpreted set of facts.  Thus, he keeps turning the idea of 'mystery story' back on itself into a whirling cesspool--he ends up sort of uncovering the truth, but has created a lot of doubt along the way.<br /><br />One wishes his detective came to the 21st Century US and were hired with the billions of dollars necessary to do a similar job on our politics and economy.  Yes, the dead would need to number in the thousands [at least!], but the improvement in life would be very evident.  One problem is that a major flaw in the US is the current hopeless value-free cynicism [that also infects 'Red Harvest'], and a mass murder of the elite would not solve that--on the contrary.",2010-04-20

When I saw Red Harvest mentioned in a magazine article, I thought, \\""Why not start here?\\""    Though Red Harvest is supposed to be set in a Western town called Personville, it feels like it's set in a big, hard-luck city. The only place big enough to fill the bill in 1929 was probably Denver. The nameless protagonist, a detective with the Continental Detective Agency in San Francisco, is called only the Continental Op(erative). The book has a huge cast of shady characters that are a bit hard to keep track of. The strangest thing about the book, though, it that it is completely passionless--almost to the point of being enervated. There are dozens of murders and ganglang killings throughout, but each one is described as coolly and bloodlessly as the next. Obviously, this coolness gives a really hard edge to the emotionless Continental Op, which I'm sure was Hammett's intention, but it also make it hard to feel anything for anyone.    Nevertheless, the dialog is smart, snappy and witty. That's the best reward for reading the book.    I admitted that I hadn't read any other of Hammett's novels so I wonder about his range of characterization, but if you've read (or seen) The Maltese Falcon, you've already been introduced to the main characters in Red Harvest: The Continental Op is a dead ringer for Sam Spade (actor Humphrey Bogart) in The Maltese Falcon. Likewise, Dinah Brand for Brigid O'Shaughnessy (actress Mary Astor), bootlegger Max Thaler for Joel Cairo (actor Peter Lorre), corpulent police Chief Noonan for Kasper Gutman (actor Sydney Greenstreet).

US,24152293,RSJE7IIYFSQZB,0679722610,645212410,Red Harvest,Books,4,4,4,N,N,"Explosively entertaining","I have always enjoyed mystery and crime novels, but I can't say I'm an avid fan of either genre.  I've read a fair amount of Sherlock Holmes, Edgar Allan Poe as well as some Victorian Gothic fiction.  I've read some Agatha Christie and other early/mid-20th century mystery/crime novels.  I'd paid attention in history class and had a basic idea of life in and around the Prohibition era in America and the world of gangsters and bootleggers.  And despite all of that, I wasn't entirely prepared for what to expect from Red Harvest.     The general style of the novel was intriguing from the onset.  We're dropped into a gritty first person narration from an unnamed character as he wanders the streets of `Poisonville' to meet some unknown client and then, later, to solve the murder of that client.     I really enjoyed the way the details of the story were presented.  The writing was very detailed and the narrator conveyed his thoughts and perceptions very well.  With the tight first person narration, the mystery for the characters was just as much a mystery to us.  Even simple details such as names and places seemed to come on a \\""need to know basis.\\""  Thus, there existed the mystery of the crime to be solved, as well as the mystery of what details were being withheld from the reader and why.     As the story progressed, I grew attached to the protagonist as a cynical hard-nosed detective of the sort who \\""always gets his man.\\""  When he solved the murder, I was impressed by the logic involved and by his way of seeing through the prejudices and smokescreens around the case.       The way the case was solved was quite unlike a Holmesian solution in that there weren't any telltale clues at the crime scene or analysis of fingerprints or paper fibers.  Instead, the Continental Op made a logical supposition and then through manipulative and threatening speech worked enough of a confession out of the killer to close the case.  It reminded me of the intimidation tactics seen in so many of the crime movies and TV shows today.     I expected the confession to be incorrect since so much of the novel was left unread.  Instead of letting the murder unravel, the plot took a different turn that I rather enjoyed.  The corrupt \\""head\\"" of Poisonville asks the Op to clean up the town and gives him carte blanche to do so.     The resulting manipulative method of setting crook against crook was a lot of fun.  What was interesting to me, as the city grew more and more corrupt, was that our protagonist had become an antihero.  Instead of the altruistic detectives of other early crime novels, the Continental Op was secretive, manipulative, vengeful and dishonest.  He had an end goal in mind and he planned to achieve it at any cost.  While he wasn't actually running a bootlegging or gambling operation himself, he largely became as corrupt as those he hunted.  He compromised those around him who may be innocent or, at least, less corruptible.     Finally, he fell beyond the point of no return and concluded his downward spiral.  At that point, I had no idea whether or not the story would allow the Op to be redeemed or if he would simply succeed in cleaning up Poisonville and then leave it a tainted and broken operative, ready to take his cynicism to the next case.  While the Op did end the novel a bit more hardened and broken than when he started, the resolution did lighten some of his burden and return his respectability.     I definitely enjoyed my experience with this book.  Looking to the few books I've read from the Victorian era, I can see numerous stark differences.  The dialog was much harsher than that of a Sherlock Holmes story and the violence was more over the top and graphic than the Victorian Gothic novels I've read.  The mystery was tight and well organized, but the clues were extracted more through force and intimidation than through insight and deduction.     What is even more striking to me is the pacing of the novel.  While it did have vivid descriptions and various scenes of thoughtful internal monologue, the pacing was much quicker than the average 19th century mystery or adventure novel.  While the story did expose many sides of human nature, the narrative didn't pause for lengthy paragraphs reflecting on the motivations or psyches of the characters or of society as a whole.  Any explicit analysis was concise and well integrated into the peppy, fast-paced world in which the action revolved.      The book's first purpose seemed to be one of escapism and it does provide an exciting escape from a mundane life.  The heightened action and quickened pace would coincide well with the quickly expanding world of the post-war Americans watching the world zip past them.  Added to the speed is the vivid portrayal of the exciting and frightening criminal underworld which puts a human face on the stories people may hear about on the radio or speculate about as they drink their own Prohibition scotch and think about where it came from.     This book opened new storytelling elements and devices that are still being used today.  It seems to create a new realistic novel that allowed it to show the darker underbelly of the world without flinching.  It also provided a darker antihero who ends the novel only partially redeemed and yet more human and relatable.     Likely somewhat shocking at first, I suspect this sort of adventure was quickly accepted by the younger for its fast pace and \\""real\\"" portrayal of the tenuous world of the 1920s.  The older generation may have found it too shocking and may even have condemned its graphic and violent content.  I can see the crime story of the 1920s as being a huge boundary pusher in terms of content and style in the same way that violent radio and then television, movies and eventually video games would continue to do over the next century.  The shock value would be titillating to the younger crowd, intriguing to the middle generation, and hateful and offensive to the older generation engrained in the classic values of days gone by.    ****  4 stars",2009-09-14

The key character in Red Harvest, however, is not the unnamed \\""Continental Op\\"" who narrates the tale but meglomaniacal Elihu Willsson, the mining magnate who transforms Personville into \\""Poisonville\\"" through his insistance on retaining absolute power over his company town by unleashing murderous gangsters to crush the local labor movement when they go on strike after World War I.

It occurred to me that I might as well review the work of that other exemplar of the modern hard-boiled noir detective story, Dashiell Hammett. Most of those familar with his work know it from Nick Charles of the Thin Man or, more likely, Sam Spade of the immortal Maltese Falcon but Hammett, like Chandler, did not blossom forth with these classics without a grinding apprenticeship in pulp detective fiction. Red Harvest represents Hammett's baptism. This story of an unnamed shamus who moreover works for a detective agency runs against the type we have come to expect from Hammett and Chandler-the independent, no-holds barred character. Have no fear our Continental Op has most of those qualities and the single-mindeness to clean up a rotten crime-dominated town no questions asked. While there is not the plot or character development of Hammett's later work here this is still a good read.    ****    Dashiell Hammett, along with Raymond Chandler, reinvented the detective genre in the 1930's and 1940's. They moved the genre away from the amateurish and simple parlor detectives that had previously dominated the genre to hard-boiled action characters who knew what was what and didn't mind taking a beating to get the bad guys. And along the way they produced some very memorable literary characters as well. Nick Charles, Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe are well known exemplars of the action detective. However, on the way to creating these literary works of art Hammett did journeyman's work at the detective genre in various pulp detective magazines. Moreover, in the beginning he hid his detectives behind the anonymous, although not faceless or without personality average detectives, of a national detective agency (shades of his own past).    The unnamed universal Continental Operative (Op) who is the central character of here is the  is the prototype for Hammett's later nameddetectives. He has all the characteristics that mark a noir detective-tough, resourceful, undaunted, and incorruptible with a sense of honor to friend and foe alike that sets him apart from earlier detectives. The plot line here requires all the resourcefulness of the Op as he tries to cleanup a new Western boom town tied together by many a criminal enterprise and the greed (and complicity) of the local bourgeois big shot who let things get out of hand. The twist and turns as Op tries to mix and match with the various interests at play drive the drama of the film. Along the way, of course, just like in the Old West, there plenty of shoot- `em-up action before the town, Personville (aka Poisonville ) is fit for respectable folks to make an honest dollar in.

The Op soon determines that the town's descent into a state approaching a low level of hell began when Willsson imported some mobsters to break up a strike.  Their stay turned out to be far from a temporary one.    For reasons of his own, perhaps just to be stubborn or perhaps as a matter of some principle or warrior code, the Op decides to stay and clean up the town.

His experiences for the firm provided the background and the name for the Continental Detective Agency that features in most of his stories and in two of his novels (including &quot;Red Harvest&quot;), and Pinkerton operative James Wright served as the model for the &quot;fat, middle-aged, hard-boiled, pig-headed guy&quot; referred to only as the Continental Op.<br />In &quot;Red Harvest,&quot; the Op is summoned to Personville (known locally as Poisonville), where he is engaged by newspaper publisher Donald Willson, who is murdered before the agent has an opportunity to meet him. At first the novel feels like a traditional murder mystery; in its first half there are two homicides (among more than two dozen gangland-style assassinations) whose clues are scattered for the reader--and the Op--to solve.<br />Yet the two whodunits are red herrings meant to distract--and entertain--the reader (and crime novel aficionados will figure both of them out within a few paragraphs). Not just a murder mystery, &quot;Red Harvest&quot; pursues broader themes: how corruption and greed poisons the inhabitants of Poisonville, how the Op is able to thwart the ambitions of various criminals by playing their own unprincipled game, and how his own abandonment of professional code nearly destroys the detective himself.<br />Most of the crooks are stock figures from noir central casting, but the novel's femme fatale, Dinah Brand, is the most memorable. She serves not only as foil to the Op's passionless cynicism but also as a warning to the dangers of the sport: like the Op, she insinuates herself into whichever camp is in control, never dirtying her own hands with the unsavory activities that bring her the money she voraciously accumulates--only to find herself expendable when no faction needs her at all.<br />During a flirtatious rendezvous with Dinah, the Op slips into a laudanum-induced dream, in which he imagines himself &quot;hunting for a man I hated.

The material was not entirely original; it first appeared in serial form in &#34;Black Mask&#34; magazine in 1927-1928 under the title &#34;The Cleansing of Poisonville&#34;. Hammett reworked the story into novel form, and &#34;Red Harvest&#34; was published in 1929. This is also the first of Hammett's popular &#34;Continental Op&#34; novels, which feature an unnamed private detective employed by the Continental Detective Agency of San Francisco. &#34;Red Harvest&#34;'s narrator and veteran Continental operative defies any idea of a glamorous or attractive crime fighter. He's short, pot-bellied, alcoholic, and resolutely cynical. He's living in an immoral world, where success comes to those who fight fire with fire. Like all of Hammett's protagonists, he has little use for the law, but lives by a personal code to which he strictly adheres. That doesn't make him especially ethical, only principled. But Hammett's characters, like Hammett himself, are coping in their own way with the widespread corruption that ruled America's cities in the 1920s and 1930s.<br /><br />&#34;Red Harvest&#34;'s opening paragraph is one of the best hooks I've ever read in a novel. It's fantastic. We are sucked into the mind of our narrator, the unnamed Continental operative, and we want only to read more about this man of such blunt wit. The Continental Op has been called to a town named Personville by the owner of the town's newspaper, Donald Willsson. He doesn't know what the job is, but before he can find out, the client is murdered. So the first order of business is to solve the murder. In doing so, our detective discovers how Personville got its nickname, Poisonville. Everything and everyone in this town is corrupt. Its citizens are ruled by bootleggers and low-lifes who retain their power through  indiscriminate violence. Even the town's former boss, Elihu Willsson, a wealthy industrialist who was not above murder in his own day, is now reluctantly under the thumb of the new crop of thugs. Our detective takes offense at Poisonville's powers trying several times to assassinate him in the course of his murder investigation, so he decides to stay and clean up the place. Little did he expect that Poisonville's rampant bloodshed would poison him, as he is seduced by the town's murderous ways.<br /><br />It's surprising to me that Dashiell Hammett wrote &#34;Red Harvest&#34; years before &#34;The Thin Man&#34;. &#34;Red Harvest&#34;'s style seems more developed and its characters better drawn than in the later novel.

And so is the book's shameless lack of justice. But perhaps Hammett  just chose a different  shock tactic in &#34;Red Harvest&#34;.

The violence is so bad that the Op never actually sees his client alive, but he sticks around to avenge his death.  The deep plot is as convoluted as any detective novel, but the basic plot of a man playing two sides against each other proved to be important in the history of film even more so than literature.<br />The Op was the original Man With No Name.  Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Western borrows both the stranger concept and the plot from Red Harvest.  Though the credit is usually given to Akira Kurosawa for his film Yojimbo, both films actually borrow their essence from Hammett.<br />It's not necessary to have seen either film to enjoy this story.  Overshadowed by the classic Maltese Falcon, Red Harvest deserves more ink than it gets.  It's here with Hammett that the noir detective novel was born.  The romantic notion of a poor detective who would rather live up to his own standards of justice than take a big payoff is a very American outlook.  I can only figure that such a character comes from the many assignments that Hammett got working for the Pinkerton detective agency and the many times that Hammett wasn't allowed to do the right thing.  Our detective is so virtuous under the standards of his own ethics that you admire him even when he is creating a bloodbath.<br />The most surprising thing is how well the whole book flows and quickly I read it.  Hammett has a great way of leaving each chapter with enough questions that you want to immediately read the next one.  He'll leave you with the conclusion of a boxing match and with a fighter that falls over with a knife in his back.

It is merely a shadow of that oldest of myths, namely, of gods giving laws to humans. In Red Harvest, a detective known as the Continental Op is the law, and much like Gods of old, he punishes those who transgress. <br />The Continental Op has been summoned to Personville (also known as Poisonville to those in the know) but when he gets there his client has been murdered. His client's father, a local business bigwig named Elihu Willsson, hires him to clean up the town.

But after doing their job, Elihu cannot just politely ask them to leave. So he offers the Op money to get rid of them any way he can. Out of a sense of outrage, justice, or just plain bloodlust, the Op accepts. <br />This novel almost seems a horror novel to me. There's a lot of blood, lots of murder, and the characters are all creepy and grotesque. For example, one character is described as \\""a bow-legged man with a long jaw like a hog's\\"". At one point in the bloodshed, the Op talks about \\""going out to feed\\"" as though he is a vampire who feeds on violence. It reminds me of the demonic descriptions of Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon. There's something very unsettling in Dashiell Hammett's books. Like H.P. Lovecraft's stories, you always sense some monster moving underneath the prose that might burn your eyes out if you saw it full on. <br />Having said this, except for that feeling of disturbance, Hammett is not the great writer that he is cracked up to be. From the 3 works I have read of his, he's not that much betteror worse than the typical contemporary crime writer. His characters seem pretty blank and empty but this actually helps out the stories which usually involve the most animalistic motives. It is an interesting experience to read his books, but I don't know if it's a rewarding or entertaining one. I guess if you want to feel unsettled, ill at ease, check his work out.

There is, however, no such animal as a bad Continental Op story, and this is one of the Op's adventures.  One of the most lamentable situations in contemporary publishing is the rather small number of Op stories in print.  It is occasionally possible to turn up one of the old anthology of Op stories that Hammett published in BLACK MASK, but these are getting harder and harder to find (though several of them recently appeared in the new Library of America edition of Hammett's stories).  BLACK MASK itself put out in the late forties, I believe, several issues collecting the otherwise uncollected stories.  My understanding is that Lillian Hellman, who held the copyright on Hammett's books until her death, would not allow these stories to be reprinted.  The copyright must be getting close to expiration, so perhaps all of Hammett's stories will once again be available.<br />I was fortunate enough to read all the stories that Black Mask collected in their special issues.  My access was through the marvelous holdings of the Beinecke Rare Book Library at Yale University.  I sat in the reading room where others were undoubtedly reading manuscripts of Boswell or Ezra Pound or Yeats, while I sat engrossed in Continental Op detective yarns.  My best guess is that there may have been enough stories to produce one or two more collections to supplement the two collections we already possess, THE CONTINENTAL OP and THE BIG KNOCKOVER.  I must admit that the quality of these stories were not overall up to the quality of those in the latter volume, which are in turn not quite up to the quality of the stories in the former volume.

They then gained control of the town, going from servants to masters; but no one gang gained control. The company owner then used his newspaper to try to advocate a &quot;civic reform&quot; campaign to regain control. His newspaper publisher son hired the Continental Op, but was killed before they meet. (Was this similar to Robert F. Kennedy's prosecution of organized crime?) Machiavelli's Letter to the Prince of Florence (p.9) tells of the problems with a mercenary army: they can takeover the government that hired them. Only a citizen army is proper to a republic. Creating a militia by arming the cirtizens of &quot;Personville&quot; could have put an end to these gangs, but the political control of &quot;Elihu Willsson&quot; would have ended as well. The 1877 strike in Pittsburgh's coal and iron industry led to the abolishment of the traditional local militia and its replacement by a state-controlled militia. Newly powerful corporations now controlled the state government, and the new &quot;National Guard&quot; developed into a strike-breaking force with the power of law. The Continental Op purges &quot;Personville&quot; and leaves, but the book doesn't tell how quickly new gangs re-appear. The corporate control continues, with its need for strike-breaking gunmen; they pop up like teeth in a shark. Corporate control of politicians and government may only be possible with this corruption. The politics of this novel guarantees that it will never be faithfully filmed by Hollywood, unlike some of his other novels. But this made it a best sell in 1929 and afterwards.",2001-08-27

It's a book about brutal people, both gangsters and politicians, who will do anything to keep their hands on the power that they've managed to get hold of. The Continental Op, Hamett's anonymous detective, finds that the only way to clean up Personville is to join the fray, and though his conscience bothers him, he fights fire with fire and matches the scummy crooks machiavellian move to machiavellian move.

In succession he confronts the murder of the publisher of the local paper, the murder of the police chief's brother, and the murder of a beautiful woman.  The publisher's father, convinced that local gangsters are responsible for his son's death, employs the Op to break up the organized crime stranglehold on Personville.  The Continental Op determines that he cannot quickly destroy the crimelords by lawful means, so he decides to work outside the law to destroy them.  The murder of the police chief's son provides him with a golden opportunity to maneuver the rival gangs into lethal conflict. During these investigations, peripheral characters drop like flies as rival gangs feud over turf.  The Continental Op continues his investigations, stirs up strife among the gangs, and tries to elude arrest himself as the dance of death lumbers to its bloody denouement.  It is near impossible to keep an accurate bodycount through the course of the novel.
