I should have known better!  The book was so much better.  There was so much more depth to the characters and their emotions, but isn’t that always the case?  The plot centers around Frank Wheeler; his job in the city and his picturesque family in the suburbs and as anybody who grew up in the suburbs can tell you, things are not always as they seem on the outside, though I’m sure that’s the case for many things.<br /><br />There are times when the novel slows down a little bit, but to me that added to the depth of Frank’s character and his narcissism.  There were also a few times when I had to make sure that I wasn’t actually reading “Mad Men: The Novel” because of the eerie similarities.  They just both show similar representations of the time period, which makes them reminiscent of each other.<br /><br />Overall, this book was a good read.  It kept me entertained.  Yates did an incredible job of painting a picture of the Wheeler family and their life. If you saw the movie, and thought it was boring, please give the book a try!  It is well worth the time and a much more involved story than the movie could portray.	2015-08-26

It's a novel which breaks the heart to read - not just because of the way Yates makes us feel for his characters, but the way it confronts the reader with themselves. It's a kind of Everyman morality tale, except there are no gods, there are no demons, there are no solutions. And yet...and yet..this is so far from some kind of nihilistic howl of rage and despair. What saves this, what makes it bearable is that Yates does not condemn his characters, indeed, he does not separate himself from them. Neither does he separate himself from us, nor us from them.<br /><br />However flawed the central characters are, their flaws are human, and a result of that mismatch between a hope of happiness and personal fulfilment, of individual striving and the long littleness which most of us will inherit. The genius of Yates (aside from the masterful writing) is that we are brought to care about these flawed, disappointed, bruised characters, because they are us. . Yates makes us peel off the mask of someone else's persona, and discover our hurting own, beneath<br /><br />The central characters, Frank and April Wheeler, see themselves as special, or about to be special, standing outside the mainstream. Frank views himself as `an intense, nicotine-stained, Jean-Paul Sartre kind of man'. He is working deep within a soulless corporate, a company making advanced calculation machines - on-the-verge-of computers. Frank sells them, but does not understand them. His workplace is full of corporate clones, but he believes himself different because he mocks them in his head, and consciously wears the mask of being one of them. He doesn't quite realise they are all consciously wearing the mask and believing themselves different. April had `attended one of the leading dramatic schools of New York less than ten years before' She wears this badge as something to set herself as more than the haus-frau she is, having married a man she has told herself (and him) is 'the most interesting person I've ever met' Frank believes April is `a first rate girl' almost out of his league. Neither see each other, or themselves, clear, without terror, hatred and rage at what their reality is. Needless to say, beneath the carefully constructed veneer, huge cracks are spreading.<br /><br />Their closest friends are Shep and Milly Campbell, a less shiny and glamorous couple but one who also believe they are somehow more than cut from a mould. Despite the close friendship, underneath they despise and distrust each other, as couples and an individuals<br /><br />The elderly real estate broker and her retired husband, Helen and Howard Givings, with the skeleton in a cupboard son, (John is an inmate in psychiatric hospital) give a third portrait of a marriage which is bleak, inside its superficial veneer. Yates offers us the small, lacerating image of the wife who prattles endlessly on in a pretence that everything in the garden is lovely, though his description of her physical life - tell-tale hands twisting in her lap - belie the bright, social manner. Meanwhile Howard sits blissfully, phlegmatically silent, reading the paper. He has turned off his hearing-aid, as is his habit and the two are in isolation, lacking awareness or willingness to be aware of each other.<br /><br />Yes, the book, with its inevitably tragic movement shows the bleak underbelly of the American Dream, but it goes far further - it shows the bleak underbelly of the hopeful, growing dreams of 'being special' which is part and parcel of adolescence and twenties, and presents the sour regret of maturity for opportunities missed, mistakes made, and the necessary accommodations which most of us will make. And where can we salvage a true meaning? Is there any hope? Yates doesn't offer much - in his view of Frank and April's parents, and what we see of the potential little Frank and April in their already neurotically developing, vulnerable children, Niffer and Michael, the previous generation set the seeds for this, and the next generation are already struggling hard to please and be whom they think their parents would like them to be, pretending also that the life-garden is full of pretty things, and studiously shutting their eyes to the hard, unforgiving rocks beneath<br /><br />And yet............in with the sour despair, there is a wit within the dialogue, the characters play their parts in being bravely ironic for each other - and ARE amusing, and do invite the reader to appreciate their sometimes mordant humour. It's the mark of a brilliant writer to do this, so that the book is lifted out of unremitting angst. The brittle, sophisticated surface is like some modern version of Restoration Comedy; the knowing wearing of the mask and of the misery beneath play brilliantly against each other. This is both darkly tragic and full of sharp, amusing touches, which makes the reader wince whilst laughing<br /><br />This is a wonderfully rich book, with a multiplicity of layers and meanings. One of those magical books where the reader discovers that they can go deeper and deeper, and discover more and more, that the craft of Yates' writing is extraordinary, the images he offers, both economical, subtle, and deep. We are not smacked in the face, instead, small touches, reflected upon, will bring more and more realisations, thoughts, reflections.<br /><br />As an example, the opening of the book is the staging of a play by a newly formed community theatre group. It is meant to be the foundation of an aspirational, sophisticated, intellectual circle of people who will challenge the status quo, who are more than duped swallowers of 1950s corporate, consumerist, sentimentalised capitalism. The play they are performing is The Petrified Forest, by Robert Emmett Sherwood, later made into a film with Leslie Howard, Humphrey Bogart and Bette Davis. The play/film has as its central characters a writer (Howard) trying to discover the meaning of existence, to find some reason for his being, some purpose, an aspirational artist who feels suffocated by the narrowness of her world (Davis) and someone living on the margins, outside the norms (Bogart) who is the challenge/catalyst. There are parallels in the lives of the central couple in Revolutionary Road, who are just such a pair, Frank Wheeler, still on the edge of that expansive, excited feeling from youth that he might `be something' and April Wheeler, his wife, whose dreams of being a fine actress never lived up to the reality of the modest talents she really had, but who is feeling that suffocation of the narrowness life offers, as a wife and (reluctant) mother. John Givings, the son of their landlady, an inmate of a mental hospital, brought out from time to time on rehabilitation visits, is the outsider catalyst whose analysis of the Wheelers, his parents, and society at large is the brutal, revealing lamp showing the Wheelers their own reality.<br /><br />And then, there is the title of the play `The Petrified Forest' - a forest is a lovely thing, dynamic, life giving, life creating, endlessly transforming through photosynthesis, sappy, magical - but, when petrified, ossified, it is stifled and stifling. There are echoes of this elsewhere - Giving's mother Helen, the successful real-estate broker, gives Frank a box of sedum plantings, for the garden he is in theory constructing. It's an unwanted gift, given at the wrong moment, and gets shoved in the cellar and forgotten. The box is discovered, later, by Helen `all dead and dried out', and she bemoans how `a perfectly good plant, a living growing thing' has been completely neglected.<br /><br />Recommended?

The result is disastrous and immediately sets the tone for the relationships and events of the novel. April, the lead in the play, is also the lead female protag. Her husband is Frank, and they are from New York, moved to the suburbs in the late 50's to raise their two kids. &#34;But not everything is as it seems.&#34; ha. Frank is a classic narcissist, a lovely realization Yates doesn't trumpet until well into the book—at first, Frank seems noble and sincere. If I had been a real person meeting the real Frank, he would have fooled me. April was bombastic and labile from the get-go, and I almost felt sorry for Frank—almost. Then I felt they were a perfect match of neuroses.<br /><br />Make no mistake, these are far from likeable characters—but they are fascinating. Enter Shep and Millie, their only &#34;friends&#34; in their small neck of the woods. Shep and Millie play the part of the beholden duo well, hanging on every word as Frank grandstands about the fictitious lives they all lead, and what an illusion it all is. April spends her time posing her long neck just &#34;so&#34;, and deferring to Frank—that is, when they aren't at each other's throats like rabid dogs.<br /><br />Then there's the nosy realtor with the insane son—ironically the only person in the book who is sane, frankly, and he's locked up at Greenacres.<br />So unfolds the drama of Frank and April and the superficial relationship they have carefully constructed, while decay rots them from underneath its foundation.<br /><br />This well-written novel is actually a scathing indictment of the culture we live in, the hypocrisies we live with, and the veneer we all use to fill in the festering holes.<br /><br />Clean, succinct writing, complex characters and a story that makes you feel as though you're wickedly encroaching on their private lives through their perfect picture window—Revolutionary Road is a delicious read, one I highly recommend.hypocrisies we live with, and the veneer we all use to fill in the festering holes.<br /><br />Clean, succinct writing, complex characters and a story that makes you feel as though you're wickedly encroaching on their private lives through their perfect picture window—Revolutionary Road is a delicious read, one I highly recommend.	2015-03-11

For all who read (or have read) this, please note the following quote from Yates: &#34;The book was widely read as an antisuburban novel, and that disappointed me. The Wheelers may have thought the suburbs were to blame for all their problems, but I meant it to be implicit in the text that that was their delusion, their problem, not mine.&#34;<br /><br />Also from a memo written by Yates six years before the publication of RR: &#34;If the suburbs are to blame- and they are to no greater extent than the 'artist' illusion...&#34;<br /><br />Those who read this book as a condemnation or examination of &#34;the other&#34; (i.e., a &#34;failed&#34; artist that sold himself out by moving to the suburbs) really miss the point. This is about our human capacity or propensity for self-delusion, and the way in which these delusions and the felt need to hold them affect (and damage) our lives. Frank Wheeler's problem is not that he lives in the suburbs but that he thinks that he's destined for &#34;something more&#34; and equally importantly the fact that that the idea of that &#34;something more&#34; is held in so much higher a regard than any aspect of his life as lived. Many who read this book as a condemnation of the suburbs may share some elements of the particular set of delusions, along with the underlying value system that supports them, with Frank Wheeler; while this increases the irony involved that they have this interpretation, the most important fact is that while the specifics of individuals' delusions vary, as does the intensity of their effects on them, the tendency itself is probably nearly universal (particularly in modern culture), and it is that that readers should be looking towards when reading this book. They should be looking inward and not outward.	2015-02-26

And that's a shame because Richard Yates at his best has very few equals and exceedingly few superiors as a writer. His finest work is easy to list: the novels &#34;Revolutionary Road,&#34; &#34;Easter Parade,&#34; and &#34;A Good School,&#34; and his short-story collections &#34;Eleven Kinds of Loneliness&#34;and &#34;Liars in Love.&#34;  They are all brilliant and all earn five stars. I urge you to read them.  But not all of Richard Yates's work is great or even good.  The late novels &#34;Cold Spring Harbor&#34; and &#34;Young Hearts Crying&#34; are indisputable disappointments that have sadly cast a negative light on his prior masterpieces.  Yates is one of those writers who can't catch a posthumous break.  I encourage you to dismiss that trend and to dig into the five works I praised.  You are in for a rare treat.	2015-01-09

Sometimes, a great work goes missing in the culturally appropriate hype surrounding the idea of the literary masterpiece. Revolutionary Road was published in 1961. It is possibly the perfect mid-twentieth-century novel of character and angst, and it has been largely forgotten. This is a great shame. Yet, Revolutionary Road  might have been written yesterday. Its concise and unfaltering portrayal of the existential failure of the suburbia-anchored middle class of the 1950s is as relevant today as it was then. Many of us still live in characterless housing environments; we still aspire to career comfort and financial success; and, as psychological entities, we still fail to understand who we are. This is noble subject matter, all the more difficult to write about given that the novel attacks and uncomfortably disrupts the middle-class value system upon which western society has, throughout the twentieth century, largely taken for granted. In every respect, Yates’s tale sets the scene, along with a few other brave novels and dramas of its ilk, for an examination of the capitalist aspirations and social mores which, from the early 1960s onwards, have been represented repeatedly in cinema and film to this day.<br /><br />The plot of Revolutionary Road  is deceptively simple. It is the tale of a young college-educated couple, April and Frank Wheeler, who have two young children, and who live at an address, Revolutionary Road, in a housing estate in Connecticut. They are part of a neighbourhood, which is fast becoming a real estate paradise, and their social life is almost exclusively in that neighbourhood. Unlike the disaster of the modern novel, which has the tendency too often to misidentify its protagonists to the point of boredom, Yates has that uncommon ability to capture the essence of a person and a situation in a few critical paragraphs. This is the principal joy of the story, out of which the destructive psychological drama of April and Frank’s suburban lifeunfolds. Yet, when one considers that Yates was writing during an era of dire moral censorship for cinema and film, the bravely-put personal opinions and descriptions of erotic and sexual life are, as far as they were capable of being depicted in print at that time, brilliantly observed and absolutely to the point. The novel, which has a haunting inevitability about it, flows without a sense of restriction or hesitation. It is time we brought Richard Yates back into the critical centre of our thinking about modern life. He is certainly worth it.<br /><br />This review is based on the novel and not the film, which I haven’t seen.	2014-12-27

His ability to describe scenes and ruminations of the different characters seemed very real. As the 'The New York Times Book Review' critic James Atlas remarked, the novel is flawless. However, the reason I gave it four stars instead of five was simply because of the tenor of the book. This baby is quite the jaded downer. There is very little joy on Revolutionary Road and only one minor character who seems to have his act together.<br /><br />It takes place in a 1955 western Connecticut suburb of New York City. The author's work was published in 1961, which was two years before the late Betty Friedan's cultural-changing 'The Feminine Mystique' gave voice to disgruntled suburban housewives. It seems Mr. Yates was ahead of his times, because he accurately portrays the disillusionment and superficiality of being a housewife, heck, or ANY suburbanite, for that matter, living the so-called American Dream. The book has much in common with the 1999 Oscar-winning movie 'American Beauty' and Sinclair Lewis's 1920 'Main Street.' Everyone tries to live up to the community's silly standards in this New England version of Levittown. Oh, and good luck finding any minorities in this thing. The major characters, Frank and April Wheeler, are in their late twenties, good-looking, sporting above-average educations, in great health, he commutes to the city, and to top it all off, they have the obligatory one six-year-old girl and a four-year-old boy. Heck, the only thing they were missing is a dog and a cat. But underneath all the sunny facades are some seriously insecure people. They're always second-guessing themselves and others.The entire group of them needed a major Dr. Phil intervention.<br /><br />I can not stress enough that 'Revolutionary Road' is very well written and an insightful work, but completely devoid of humor except for the very last line of the story.

Frank and April Wheeler have the perfect 1950s lifestyle - the nice house in suburbia, the two children; he with the daily commute to a good job in the city; she, a home-maker, beautiful and decorative - the middle-class, mid-20th century American Dream made real. But strip away the superficial and we find two people who have failed to be the people they expected to be, who are living every day with the disappointment of what they and each other has become. There is a desperation at the heart of this book - the desperation of rats caught in a laboratory maze.<br /><br />Although Yates takes us into the minds of most of the characters at points, we mainly see the world through the eyes of Frank Wheeler. The book begins as April takes part in an amateur performance of The Petrified Forest - a play with the central theme of artistic and intellectual worth trapped in a loveless and humdrum existence, but where tragedy leads to escape. No coincidence that this should be the play that Yates chose, and no coincidence either that the performance should fail badly, leaving April publicly humiliated. Already in these early pages, Yates has signalled his major themes of intellectual elitism, entrapment and failure.<br /><br />Frank once aspired to lead the life of an intellectual, perhaps to be a Hemingway, defying convention and rejecting the lifestyle of his parents. He was feted in his student days as one of the coming generation, a brilliant conversationalist who would (in some way that he never quite got around to pinning down) have an intellectual impact on the world. April - beautiful, cool, aloof - aspired to be a serious actress. Each attracted to the other's projected image rather than to the underlying person, they seemed an ideal glittering match, until the reality of pregnancy forced them down the path of conventionality towards earning a living and making a home.<br /><br />Now they are trapped - by their children, by society, but mostly by each other. As they fail to be what they anticipated they see their failure reflected back to them from the other's eyes. It is only when April comes up with a radical plan to allow them to regain their lost glamour as free-wheeling intellectuals that Frank begins to realise he may no longer have the courage to pursue this dream - to risk discovering that he lacks the intellectual wherewithal, the belief in which has been the foundation of his sense of snobbish superiority over his neighbours and colleagues. When April reveals that she is once again pregnant, for Frank it is an excuse to retreat back to the safety of his conventional life. But to April it's another trap - to keep her in a lifestyle she never wanted and to prevent Frank from becoming the man she thought she was marrying. For April, the coming child is her prison - for Frank, it is his escape.<br /><br />Yates is brutal to his characters, shining a light so bright there's nowhere for them to hide. And through them, shining a light on this '50s society, perhaps the last generation where women were still so irrevocably defined by motherhood and the men they married; and perhaps the first generation where men were beginning to question the role of masculinity in an increasingly white-collar world. Frank's ambivalence towards his father is based on a mixture of intellectual condescension together with an unacknowledged jealousy of his physical skills, embodied in the recurring image of his father's powerful hands.<br /><br />Post-war, we see a generation of ordinary men who had access to higher education, often as the first in their family to do so. Where for Gatsby the American Dream was about money, birth and beauty, Yates shows the '50s as a time of two dreams in conflict - the security of middle-class suburbia and the excitement of intellectual escape - with his characters caught between them. And yet Yates also seems to suggest that neither dream is worthy of pursuit - that somewhere along the way the lofty aspirations ofprevious generations have narrowed and shrunk down to this.<br /><br />The '50s were a time of huge change - the beginning of the decade still reflecting pre-war values and conventions, and the end looking forward to the surge of youth culture, sexual freedom and social upheaval that typified the '60s. Yates brings the period brilliantly to life in this shortish novel that nevertheless has space to look not just at the characters as individuals but also at the society and culture they inhabit. His depiction of Frank's workplace as a soulless maze of pointless paper-shuffling is superb, reflecting the growing struggle, for men in particular, to find some sense of fulfilment and worth when there is no physical input and no visible end result.<br /><br />Yates captures the language of the time so well that I could hear the dialogue being spoken in my head. These words could have been spoken at no other time and in no other place. And yet for all the talking in the book, there's no sense of communication - each character is ultimately alone, desperately trying to hide behind the image they project. There are moments of quiet beauty in the writing, and an integrity in the characterisation that leads the reader to empathise even when we see them stripped down to their worst flaws and insecurities. And perhaps we empathise most because he makes us fear that we recognise ourselves in there somewhere. A masterpiece.previous generations have narrowed and shrunk down to this.<br /><br />The '50s were a time of huge change - the beginning of the decade still reflecting pre-war values and conventions, and the end looking forward to the surge of youth culture, sexual freedom and social upheaval that typified the '60s.

Except they don't see themselves that way.  They feel they have nothing in common with their neighbors and think of themselves as destined for greater things.  Somehow, they've managed to convince each other that uprooting their family and moving to Europe will be just what the doctor ordered.<br /><br />Revolutionary Road by Richard Yates is a very well written novel about people suffocating under the burden of their own lives.  Even though most people would envy the lives they have.<br /><br />This is a compelling story with well fleshed out characters, dialogue that rings true and a completely believable narrative.  A great novel about life in 1950s America with an underlying theme that's timeless.  Very highly recommended.	2013-12-10

But when the day of change draws near, tensions mount as they have to confront whether they really want the change after all; and if they don't, what does that say about them?  This is not a plot of movement, but of stagnation, and the tension that builds with stagnation.<br /><br />2) Characters (5 stars) - Frank Wheeler is the intellectual consciously aware of the persona he is projecting--every movement is calculated, every moment compared against the ideal of what he should be doing.  He thinks this awareness is a mark of intelligence, of being more observant of life and its possibilities.  But is it?  Or is it just immature insecurity?  April Wheeler is the no-nonsense female lead--strong, sharp, but trapped in a 1950s America that offers her few outlets.  Then there are the neighbors--simpler, faker counterpoints to the Wheelers ... but are they really that different in the end?<br /><br />3) Theme (5 stars) - I thought this book did a wonderful job of exploring the 30 year old crises.  That time when you put aside the childhood dream and become your parents.  And how when the \\"intellectuals\\" reach this point they think they are the only ones who can see the falseness of modern life, and the missed opportunity for beauty and truth and nuance; while the uneducated masses bounce along, glassy eyed, happily chasing the shiny toys society offers them.  But is it really that simple?  Is anyone really so myopic?  Or does everyone see the silliness, and the division isn't the intellectuals vs. the simpletons, but those who can enjoy life vs. those who can't?  There's also a theme in here about dreams.  About how dreams are nice when you can't reach them because they offer you a different life you can daydream about.  But when dreams are there for the taking they become much scarier, they become hard work.<br /><br />4) Voice (4 stars) - Yates is an extremely talented writer.  His sentences are focused on minute psychological or sociological details, yet he still manages to not get the paragraphs bogged down, to have them flow smoothly and entertainingly from scene to scene.<br /><br />5) Setting (4 stars) - Suburbia in 1950s America.  The cul-de-sacs, the kids, the going to a job you hate.  It was all described well.<br /><br />6) Overall (4 stars) - At times I thought this might be a 5 star book.  But in the end, I just felt like it was missing the final 10% (maybe in plot) to keep it from being a masterpiece.  Still, I would highly recommend it.	2013-08-25

This is an honest couple who are desperately in love.  It's only when the young wife wants to be left alone after a poor amateur stage performance, while her husband seems unable to accept her simple wish, that the basic flaw in the relationship begins to make itself known.<br />You're left caring about both of the main characters, thinking that if only he could learn to let her have time to herself when she needs it, and he could learn to live without her approval at critical times, that their lives would be good.<br />Yet it's not this simple, and Yates gives the reader a great deal to think about.  The conversations veer from sweet to caustic, and the reader is pulled in.<br />The few items that are definitely out of the '50's are minor, and the personal interactions seems as relevant today, and as urgent, as they did when the novel came out in 1961.  Strange that it took until 2008 for a motion picture to be made, but perhaps that's a tribute to how good the book is:  That is is good enough to use for an outstanding motion picture after collecting dust fot 47 years!	2013-04-23

Frank and April are just shy of thirty, with two lovely children.  They live in a cozy house in the country.  Frank commutes the his job in the city and April is a homemaker.  It is the ideal life.<br />Or, more appropriately, the ideal lie.  There is trouble brewing under the surface.  They've given up their dreams of doing great things and living an interesting life, and instead live the life they are supposed to want.  They aren't happy, but they don't know how to talk about it, or how to fix it, and there doesn't seem to be a way out.  Until April comes up with a wild plan that they think could fix it.  And that's when everything falls apart.<br />The 1950's was a time of growth and unbridled potential for some, but for others it was a prison of social restrictions.  Yates addresses many issues that surfaced; listlessness of the returning soldiers, the lack of opportunity for women, the restrictive society rules, the expectations of the American Dream.  And what happens when desperate people reach the end of their rope.<br />This is not a book of action.  This is a psychological book, about thoughts, perspectives, and motives.

They are more like a couple of 1950s bohemians who somehow 'compromised' themselves to an ordinary life when the girl fell pregnant and then hate themselves for it.<br /><br />Chapter 1 reads well (otherwise it wouldn't get past any publisher's editor!) and has one good line referring to the odor of fresh loam from the fields coming through the car window as the Wheelers go to the play.<br />I found reading the rest of the book a bit of a labour.<br />Frank's masterly letter to mollify his associates in another division was amusing - and quite real to those familiar with sales managers.<br />The sparring with the institutionalised son of their realtor was very stilted : a blatant case of character creation solely to raise uncomfortable questions.<br />There is another great line when - during one of their less stormy periods - Frank admires April's legs on the couch as she speaks away fluently on some subject : \\"Never before had beauty grown more purely from truth.\\"<br /><br />But the bulk of the story read like an enauseating mixture of cliché.<br />Maybe it fell victim of the psycho genre trend of the day, making extreme what one simply wanted to highlight. For sure it focusses far too much on the vie intérieure of characters rather than on their real living. The notion that human nature - not least the issues raised when living together - would somehow disappear were they to simply drop out of mainstream job + mortgage lifestyle would never cut it in a novel today.<br /><br />All the same, I share a reaction with a previous reviewer : I have been looking into Yates' other work, expecially the short stories.	2012-10-12

Usually, I hate too much description especially describing scenary; but I loved the detailed and thorough accounts of each character.  Yates has a very special way of making me care about the lives of the characters; he could pinpoint an entire scene of characters, and with great descriptive detail I could feel emotions and understand what was  going on.  He could zero in on the minutia of life and I could relate to or ponder it when he decided to reveal something.<br /><br />I didn't think I would like the story.  I was wrong; I am glad. I found the Wheelers to be realatable in that I could see parts of myself in them.  I understood what it is to have a mundane little life but while thinking I should BE someone or somewhere else.<br /><br />Yates uses a lot of semi-colons which is helpful to me because I am always struggling to figure out when to use them.	2012-09-13

It's also about finding out that you're more frightened of that something more than you ever considered you'd be.  It's about play-acting at adulthood, about the frightfully difficult problems in maintaining a marriage, and also the nearly insurmountable gulfs between men and women.  Most of all, though, it's an awfully good representation of how we can be so easily swayed away from working toward what we think we can be, and falling into safety of useless diversion.<br /><br />Like writing Amazon reviews, I suppose.  Still, although the insights in Richard Yate's first novel have a certain amount of validity to them, they are also true only from a particular perspective - namely that of the thirtysomethings who populate the story.  As one who is on the other side of that hump, much of what the Wheelers go through in their tortuous journey strikes me as rather childish, in the same way that I can look back on that time as I experienced it and think of it also as childish.<br /><br />That doesn't mean that REVOLUTIONARY ROAD suffers as a novel for it.  In fact, it's very good - Yates hits very few false notes in as much as this is the type of story he is trying to tell.  It is captivating throughout, although I do think the ending partly a cop-out.  How much more horrible would it have been if the Wheeler's had been forced to continue on in the same manner!  The climactic finish actually inserts a note of unreality into a story that had before seemed a realistic picture of young adults meandering through their lives and wondering what to do about it.<br /><br />I feel as though I'm damning with faint praise, which isn't the tone I wanted at all.  I do feel, however, that this novel will have a different effect on readers depending on where they are in life.To me, the impact feels muted because my focus is on different things now - fifteen years ago, I probably would have thought it a masterpiece of poignant realism.  Today, I think of it as a well-crafted enjoyable read, and shake my head at all the energy I wasted when I was thirty wishing I was something I wasn't.	2012-08-30

With effortlessly beautiful writing and incredibly vivid characters, this book sucks you into the world of 1960s suburbia with all of its subtleties and quiet dramas. It is, in fact, the skill with which Yates develops his characters that makes this book so difficult to review and to completely enjoy.<br /><br />Revolutionary Road is the picture of perfect character-building. From the very first chapter, the use of dialogue and short, clear passages of description give the reader an incredibly strong sense of who Frank and April Wheeler really are. Right away, I felt like I knew these characters, like I had met them a thousand times before. While this is itself a rare accomplishment, Yates takes this book to the next level by subverting the reader's first perceptions of the characters. By slowly adding chapters from the perspective of characters other than Frank, Yates gives the reader a different angle on Frank's character, his marriage to April, and his relationship with his neighbors and friends. Slowly, the reader discovers more depth to both April and Frank's already round characters, and not everything that is discovered is flattering.<br /><br />It is this evolution of the reader's perception of the characters that makes this book so difficult to review or even completely enjoy. The truth is that there is one character who I absolutely hated more than I have hated any other character in any book, and possibly more than I've hated anyone in real life. I spent the whole book torn between wanting to know what happened next and wanting to throw the book across the room out of sheer anger and frustration with that character. In short, I wanted him to die in a fire. While I'll admit that it takes incredible skill to make a character so believably unlikable, and while I understand that the absolute horribleness of that character was crucial to the theme and plot, it also makes the book difficult to enjoy, or at least it did for me. I'm usually ok with unlikable characters, but this one hurt and frightened me on a deep emotional level, possibly because he was so real. Maybe I'm particularly sensitive to portrayals of spousal abuse and manipulation, but there were times when I considered just not finishing it, even though the writing was incredible. If it hadn't been required reading for a class, I might not have. That has never happened to me before, and I honestly don't know what to make of it.<br /><br />To be honest with you, I still don't know how I feel about this book. The writing was beautiful, easy to read, and incredibly enjoyable. The characterization was among the best I've ever seen. But, despite those two amazing qualities, that one character and all the horrible things he did to another character made reading this book difficult. Because of that difficulty, I cannot recommend this book to wholeheartedly. While I think that a lot of people would greatly enjoy it, there are people I know who would find this book too disturbing and emotionally intense, and because of that I cannot recommend it to everyone. If you don't mind reading a book that has abuse, manipulation, and a seriously messed up character in it, then I would recommend this book as one of the best examples of writing and characterization I have ever read.

This combination is well-suited and can give or take the other ingredients above, if all else fails they'll do just fine with alternate ingredients.<br /><br />Now, put the whole shebang together and see what you get; a bit of happiness, a lot of sadness, a lot of false-hatred, self-loathing, busy-beeing and a hell of a lot of emotions.<br /><br />OUTCOME<br /><br />Children are left to clean up all the mess and they miss out on their most important ingredients because they don't seem to want to combine with the children, children are just the dressing or the side salad or side sauce, something that's there but not necessarily what's thought about first, if at all. An after dinner mint is definitely required.<br /><br />There is much I can say about this novel but I'll leave it at that, a bit of fun with a recipe instead of the ramble of darkness I could go on about.	2012-03-31

Ms. Wheeler is supposedly a rare unique and colorful person with actual aspirations in life other than to conform with our rigid purposeless Christian society.  The entire notion of marriage is unfair to her.  She should have been able to abort her first child in order to avoid the bondage of her unwanted marriage.  Mr. Wheeler was able to see the 'truth' until he was offered an promotion and therefore more money and more accumulation of 'property.'  The solution to all this is revolution...in the form of tearing down all of our social constructs that were built upon Judeo-Christian worldviews.  A better world would not restrict individuals to any behavior other than self-serving behavior.  Only a state-controlled society could do such a thing.  Individuals would not be bound by anything other than their own personal choices (or contracts).  To me the saddest commentary is that almost noone who watches, reads, or becomes influenced by this thought pattern has any actual understanding of it.	2010-10-06

This sets the tone for the rest of the book, and the author's exploration of the themes of social aspirations, the desire the project oneself, and role-playing to meet or consciously balk social expectations.     Like the Laurel Players, everyone in the story knows that they are merely putting on a performance. They resent the trappings of middleclass life. Frank and April Wheeler get together with friends Shep and Milly Campbell to drink and put on a veneer of sophisticated and jaded ennui as they rail at the failure of the American dream and its lack of \\"authenticity.\\" So long as they can scoff at society and speak of it with derision, they can remain above it and be untouched by it. But no one really remains untouched or unaffected.      The story is told from Frank's perspective and he is the master of play-acting and self-image. Yates adeptly uses imagery to convey this. One of the prevalent images is that of mirrors. Frank is constantly checking his reflection in the mirror and adjusting his expression so that it reflects what he wants to project. The book also contains extensive descriptions of Frank's clothes and how he feels in them. Apparently, in this case, the clothes DO make the man. Frank literally fashions himself into the image he wants to project, always conscious that his projection in insincere. He feels that his scorn is heroic, that he can see things to which others are blind, he can understand things that are beyond their comprehension. His understanding, however, is limited to the extent to which he can control his world.     The façade of toughness hides the fact that he has a basic need. What Frank seeks most of all, from his father, from his wife, from society, is affirmation of his manhood. April is aware of this and when she suggests herplan make it possible to move to Paris so that he can realize his dream of the artistic, intellectual life he has always claimed to want, she appeals to the logic that means the most to Frank: \\"It's your very essence that's being stifled here. It's what you are that's being denied and denied and denied in this kind of life... You're the most valuable and wonderful thing in the world. You're a man.\\" He accepts this argument and is buoyed by it, feeling that \\"Never before had elation welled more powerfully inside him; never had beauty grown more purely out of truth; never in taking his wife had he triumphed more completely over time and space... He had taken command of the universe because he was a man.\\"      Frank's elation, however, is short-lived. Although he had always purported to want to move to France to pursue the dream of the intellectual and cultured life, in fact he is horrified because actually trying to succeed would leave him vulnerable to failure. April unwittingly comes to his rescue again, when it turns out that she is pregnant. Frank now has the excuse he needs not to go ahead with the plan. April is devastated, and the events that unfold as she tries to keep their dream alive spiral into tragedy.      Richard Yates's writing style is rich in images and character contrasts. Revolutionary Road explores a lot of the same themes as Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman: the sham of the middleclass dream, the ordinary man as hero (at least in his own mind), infidelity, entitlement, social convention and morality, rejection of and by family, a lack of affect. The difference is that whereas Willy Loman embraces the American Dream, Frank Wheeler attempts to disavow it, even as he is being sucked into it. Both eventually end up being destroyed by it. This is the sort of future that one could foresee for Willy Loman's sons. In fact the timing would be about perfect, with Death of a Salesman being written in 1947 and Revolutionary Road coming out in 1959.    Even a lot of the imagery that Yates uses is a tactic nod to Miller's original. Both works contain symbolic references to: seeds (DOAS), plants (RR); diamonds (DOAS), golden (RR), the rubber hose (DOAS), the rubber syringe (RR).    For all that is borrows from Miller's masterpiece, Revolutionary Road stands up on its own as an independent piece that is still relevant today. The book's Revolutionary Road leads to the suburbs, and there is no escape.	2010-09-30

What is especially impressive, as David Sedaris remarks on the blurb of my edition, is the way in which the main characters constantly deceive each other, and themselves.<br /><br />A fine story, written in clear honest prose. On the surface it is not a complicated novel, but it contains many subtelties and truths about the nature of suburban relationships, and its effects are certainly powerful.	2010-08-20

Some background may be helpful:  I hadn't watched the movie prior to reading this; I was steered toward it through my interest in the TV series Mad Men.  What I found in the book was a vivid, painful, disturbing portrait of suburban life, lived by couples who only have a vague sense of what it means to be happy and struggling to link success with fulfillment.<br /><br />One of the things that struck me was how timeless the story is.  Living, generally, the life of the Wheelers in Suburban America, I was genuinely surprised that so many issues spoken of over fifty years ago are relevant today.  Indeed, what I found so disturbing as I followed the story of Frank and April Wheeler was the extent to which I asked myself, \\"Is that me?\\"<br /><br />The language is straightforward and the narrative easy to understand.  It is surprising, then, at what a vivid, clear picture Yates creates of this sad, lost couple who can only wonder at the path that led them from beginnings of such promise.  The author gives brief but effective treatment of the couple's past and the impact on their lives of their parents, friends.  Supporting characters are likewise illuminated.  Some of the characters reminded me of what Holden Caulfield would have called 'phonies,' people relating to each other inconsistently with how they actually felt.  In the end, the novel is a biting critique of a time that most view with fond nostalgia - the economic boom that followed post WWII - revealed without prejudice, but rather simply and without pretense, as in a cold, bright light.  It is a story of bright and promising people getting stalled in a life of malaise; it is a story of a life lived falsely and a struggle to reconcile expectations and potential with reality.  I was moved deeply by the characters' struggles.  Though I found the story a tough experience, it is not a tough read: It was difficult to put down this book down.<br /><br />This book had maximum impact on me to the extent that it did because I approached it without expectations and reflected on it with introspection.  I appreciate books that affect or move me in some way for some time after reading them.  This is one such book, written intelligently and superbly crafted.because I approached it without expectations and reflected on it with introspection.

This was one of them. Much of what the characters do is reprehensible but the portrayal of them is never two dimensional. Even the odious Mrs. Givens, whose obsession with convention and appearances is, at times, almost cartoonish, was the one character who actually drove me to tears when, in a rare moment of insight, she clings to the bedpost and rues the fact that her feet are more like toads that what Cinderella might slide into a slipper. The scene is both humorous and heartbreaking. Heartbreaking because it is a brief moment when her social facade breaks down and we see that she is just as trapped, miserable and confused by the indignities of life as everyone else in the novel. This is not \\"feel-good\\" stuff. But it is honest, and as much as the author pokes fun at the faults of his characters, there are no villains. That would be too easy.     I grew up with parents very much like Frank and April. This book was worth more than years of therapy in helping to understand them.	2009-06-04

To my surprise, the novel actually ended up becoming interested in the story as I read, and wanted to finish the book (something I have rarely found when reading assigned books).  It is a pretty depressing book, and while reading it I despised every character (except for one or two minor characters) for one thing or another.

Overall, I wouldn't say that it is anywhere near one of my favorite books, but definitely something worth reading.	2009-05-29

Too bad the author is dead; so that I now feel a little callous in writing this commentary. The book was very entertaining and surely Richard Yates characterizes like say Steinbeck or Austin. Throughout my reading (was a real page turner) I would think him a little feminine in his detailed characterizations. I wondered if he was in fact gay. So he was ahead of his time it would seem. Apparently Yates was writing during the wholesome 50's about enlightened people that were culturally superior to the suburban fakers in Revolutionary Road Estates. The woman (April) was the heroin. Frank with his macho name but cowardly soul was a (hetero-basher's) stereotypical straight guy, emasculated by his slavish false vain efforts to please our beloved heroin. Only she is completely self centered. She doesn't care to try to help Frank become more of a man. And in the end we find that Richard's wonderful work is nothing more than a case for Roe v Wade (albeit ahead of its time). What a fool (I am). Snookered. Don't you be a fool also. There is no room for a normal Christian in 2009. Maybe a few women have died with coat hanger abortions, but how many fetuses/babies have died inauspiciously via frivolous abortions. 5 million to one. And in the coat hanger case, it is about the poor little women; never about the fetuses/babies is it. As a man (not that unlike the despicable hetero-Frank) I would (pray to have the courage when the time came to) die for my kids. Logically and spiritually it is altogether fitting Richard. Screw April. I never liked the name April anyway; funny that Richard would use a low class name for his culturally superior little coat hanger victim.	2009-03-21

Married or not, suburbs or city, housewife or career man, these details don't really matter.  What does matter is the inner dialogue you have with yourself.    Books and movies are often so harrowing because the thoughts are there on a page or on screen and they appear larger than life but really, in the course of a day how many times are you repulsed or angered by the very same person who earlier in the day captivated you, just like everybody in this book?    When you are alone you think about how you would like to be with someone and when you are in a relationship you are oftentimes dying to get your space.  These are only a couple in a number of battles you have with yourself, and only you will be able to devise the method to deal with them.    Frank and April aren't any different than any other married couple.  The truth is, they were both getting older and that is really everyone's main hang up.  The rest is just window dressing.	2009-02-04
US	52558610	R3QNRQUC8LLCID	0375708448	840034938	Revolutionary Road	Books	4	0	0	N	Y	Well written, if dated	I think the writing is first-rate.  The plot avoids making melodramatic martyrs out of the characters.  There is no portrayal of Frank and April has being these intrinsically Byronic repressed-artist types.  The closest the book comes to that are April's vague thespian ambitions.  What we have is more of a sense of unsettledness in the milieu of Eisenhower-era suburbia.      The interesting part of their characterization is the depiction of the events of their youths, April's loveless childhood and Frank's wanderlust and his vague sense that he was meant for something big.  Thus, it isn't just the intrinsic qualities of suburbia but the Wheeler's ill-adaptedness to it.    At the risk of giving too much away, the shifting in the perspective of the story to the Campbells from the Wheelers was a deft choice.  I have to think that having a mentally unbalanced character making the trenchant observations he makes in the book has a cliched feel to it (sort of like having a blind character be the most insightful).    I think that back in 1961, the idea of a dry rot lying inside 1950s suburbia was probably had more of an impact then it would now.  This is largely because the Wheeler's of the 1960s and 1970s were, in fact, more daring in living out of the box then their 1950s predecessors.  Likewise, the use of the consideration of abortion as a plot device would've carried more weight pre-Roe v. Wade.	2009-01-28

If you yourself struggle with where you are in life this is not exactly the best book to read.  Though set in the 50's I found it to still echo what I think a lot of people must feel that choose to live in the cookie cutter neighborhoods.      I truly believe that everyone grows up with an idea that they will be different.  That they will be doing something interesting in life.  There house will be amazing.  They will travel extensively.  They will be unique.        The characters in the book are very interesting.  The phrase \\"two ships passing in the night\\" best describes the interactions of a married couple that were so in love once but certainly never evolved as a married couple together.      I don't know why it took me so long to read this book.  But, I enjoyed it.  When Mrs. Givings gives her take on everyone at the end of the book I personally was over her for good.  I think we've all been able to say we know a Mrs. Givings.    The Campbell's I felt helped close the story out quite nicely.  The different perspectives. Yates nailed it, that at the end of the day people like to make other peoples drama their own.  It makes people feel better when they can say how sad someone elses life is and yet not see what their own is.  It makes them feel better about themselves some how.     Definitely a must read.  But, I wouldn't take this book on a vacation.  This is more of a winter read over a weekend.  It does not make you want to move to the suburbs that is for sure!	2009-01-27

How is that possible? How are American letters so bass-ackward that he isn't on 'The List' of greats along with Updike, Pynchon, Fitzgerald and Stegner? I mean, I studied English Literature in college and never read the guy!<br /><br />Okay, enough astonished protest. I'm also an obsessive fan of 'Mad Men,' which I now understand is so clearly influenced by this work that it's practically an adaptation in and of itself. The bitter world that Yates exposes resonates with us all, whether we are of the 50s, earlier or later generations; the facts remain the same. How Edith Wharton skewered society's tropes in the nineteenth century and Fitzgerald did the same to the 20s, I feel 'Revolutionary Road' does for the 50s. Yates is relentless in peeling back layer after layer of his characters' perceptions until they are left with nothing, and nothing is who they have become - or, perhaps, always were and just didn't know it. In a sense, it's like 50s gothic; this work is populated with wretches, leading wretched existences, only they see everything through the rose-colored glasses of glossy advertising and suburban dreams.<br /><br />I would unreservedly recommend this work. Having become a fan of Ian McEwan's character studies (which is how I think of his books), I feel that Yates has the same intriguing touch; his observations on human nature are astute and unforgiving. A beautifully executed book.	2009-01-02

Richard Yates' 1961 novel, \\"Revolutionary Road\\", is a classic that has taken far too long to get the recognition it deserves (considering Yates died in 1992).    With the Hollywood version coming out the best way to describe this haunting novel in cinematic terms would be: \\"American Beauty\\" meets \\"In the Bedroom\\" meets \\"The Ice Storm\\" and set in 1961.  Even with the 1960 sentiments throughout this novel still rings true for modern times and is completely accessible with its theme of unrealized dreams and feelings of being trapped in a life out of your control.    The Wheeler's are the perfect symbol of suburbia on the surface - but to look deeper you see the turmoil just out of eyesight.  The most pivotal character in the entire novel is that of John Givings, the institutionalized son of the Wheeler's realtor who hits to the core with every insightful barb that flies from his mouth.    I can only hope the movie version can come even close to the vision Yates has created in this classic tale.	2008-11-16

It's depressing, the characters are for the most part unlikable, at times it seems to drag, but I wanted to know how it ends. Richard Yates is a great writer and I like his style, but I don't think this is the type of book that you just LOVE.    I am always fascinated by novels with similar themes of disillusionment, etc. What I found most interesting about this book is the fact that the 1950s is the modern era in which the characters yearn for yesteryear. For me growing up, the 50s were always pointed to as the good old days, and it wasn't until the mid 60s that things started to change. I liked the descriptions of the kids zoning out in front of the TV and Frank describing how the men on TV are always portrayed as bumbling idiots while the wives have it all together. It's just funny to see that the same observations and complaints have been made for decades. People complained about the cookie-cutter houses then just as they do now about the McMansions.....    Anyway, it's not a classic, and if you're pressed for time, I don't know that I would spend what time I did have reading this particular book. Try Fitzgerald instead.	2008-10-16

However, this novel makes Mad Men look like Happy Days (but let's hope Mad Men doesn't jump the shark!)  It's pretty damned dark.  Written in 1961, it starkly portrays a not-so-young suburban couple completely disaffected with their lovely house, comfortable income,  adoring friends, affable neighbors, easygoing bosses, unbelievably well-behaved kids, and unprecedented Postwar American peace and prosperity.  (Presumably they also have problems with mid-century modern architecture, cool jazz, early rock-and-roll, and a new Alfred Hitchcock movie every year. What a drag.)  So disgusted with the godawful daily grind of living the American Dream,  all they can do is scream at each other, drink themselves to sleep every night, and plan to move to France.  Hello, what's their problem?  Well, the Wheelers' problem has nothing to do with living in \\"Conformist\\" 1950's Connecticut or any other place and time.  It has everything to do with: phenomenal self-delusion, reflexive deception, semi-functioning alcoholism, crappy childhoods, nonexistent parenting skills, and -- most of all -- a truly deeply messed-up marriage.  It's A Classic for good reason: extremely well-written, compelling, and brutally honest. Well worth reading, but not much fun.	2008-10-05

Frank and April Wheeler are a reflection of what happens when Americans settle for the comfort and empty promises of the suburban life. The characters often operate on such a superficial level that their level of self suppression is suffocating to themselves and their relatives. While reading this I could not help but reflect on my own life and ask myself if I settled for an empty suburban existence. My conclusion is that the people of Revolutionary Road found no happiness or joy from their children. In the end that is what was truly sad; the kids being raised by adults who were so depressed from their own dissatisfaction they could not provide the children with the love that they themselves had lacked when growing up. Perhaps that is the true message Yates was trying to get across; the dysfunctional cycle Americans have created by not being able to find meaning and happiness in their families.	2008-09-16
US	11265259	R2V23654NI0FB5	0375708448	840034938	Revolutionary Road	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Truly spectacular	I picked up REVOLUTIONARY ROAD because I found it in a bookstore for $4 and remembered seeing that this was being made into a movie starring Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet (and Kathy Bates is also in it... Titanic lovers rejoice!) and directed by Sam Mendes of American Beauty fame. Hmm.. a movie about suburban life starring two of the best actors currently working and directed by the man who directed the quintessential suburban movie? I had to check the story out, especially after seeing the rave reviews on Amazon.     The rave reviews are all deserved. This book is truly spectacular. I expect the only reason this book is not enormously popular today is that it takes such a devastating look at a time most Americans prefer to look at with nostalgia. The basic story is that of one couple, Frank and April Wheeler, who as a young couple looked very promising but after they had children before they were ready to, they slipped into this sort of suburban limbo. They are beginning to realize their lives are slipping into the boring suburban life of their neighbors that they constantly complain about. The story is about them, each now about 30 years old, trying to revitalize their boring lives of which they hate. Richard Ford puts it best in the introduction when he says that author Richard Yates \\"brought us - through art - near enough to life's palpable details that we can recognize our own lives, yet preserved for us a distance from which we can exercise judgment and be relieved that the Wheelers aren't us\\". Indeed, the Wheelers aren't simply your average suburban couple. They are in fact unique people in unique situations. While parts of their rocky relationship will seem familiar and hit home with many who read it, there is always that feeling that we are not in fact the Wheelers. This keeps this very grim novel from being too depressing.    Yates really does make all of his characters very intriguing, and their relationships with each other are very carefully constructed. His dialogue is very real, but it isn't the dialogue that really shines in this book, but rather Yates' extraordinary ability in articulating the thoughts of each one of these characters. This is what makes this book very hard to put down and ultimately makes it a true masterpiece. This may make it hard for the movie to truly capture Yates' brilliance, but I'm still crossing my fingers. If you are also someone who thought the movie sounded interesting and have a chance to read the book, I highly recommend you do so.	2008-08-24

'Revolutionary Road' is a fascinating yet rather depressing look at suburban American life in the 1950s.  A young couple, a precursor to yuppies, with a pair of kids have the car, the home, good looks - the works.  However in their eyes everything seems distorted, confused.  They discover that although they might be living the American dream it wasn't THEIR dream.  And the couple also find it hard to remember what they ever saw in each other.  To keep up appearances and perhaps hold up their marriage they come up with lofty ideas and endeavors which fail from the get go.  Unsurprisingly, unlike in Grimm's fairy tales they don't live happily ever after.    'Revolutionary Road' works beautifully on many levels.  The characterizations are drawn flawlessly.  The prose captures the suffocating existence of the main characters as well as the generally dysfunctional supporting characters.  The overall tone is subdued and understated.        Bottom line: the false promises of the American dream surface prominently in this deceptively clever novel.  Strongly recommended.	2008-07-12

Every paragraph, every sentence, every punctuation mark seems relentlessly perfect.  His unusual, unnerving realism, which has captivated Andres Dubus, Richard Ford, and so many others, lacks the fireworks of a DeLillo or the intricacies of a Pynchon, but offers the accessibility and the density of an American Tolstoy.    Revolutionary Road is a classic account of America's historic infatuation with joining in, but distancing from, the middle class. Yates give us a perfect book that proffers chills as well as thrills to any reader who has the fortitude to give its middle class characters a fair hearing.    No American writer has made occasionally unsympathetic, always unexceptional characters more interesting or more intelligible.    Not merely scary good, but truly scary great.	2008-06-19

It's a social novel about The Way We Live Now, only in this case Now is over 40 years ago and Yates' take on the plight of the poor souls marooned in corporate/suburban America has long since been digested and superseded. It still persists to some degree--in films like American Beauty, novels such as Tom Perotta's Little Children, and the brilliant TV show Weeds. But, American Beauty aside, contemporary takes on suburbia tend to be much less tragic and portentous.    Frank and April Wheeler, Yates 20-30-something protagonists are, in their own misguided way, dissidents struggling against certain stereotypically oppressive aspects of American life in the 50's: conformity; the tedium and banality of life in the suburbs and the mid-century corporate workplace (they live in Connecticut, Frank works in New York); in April's case, against a life of homemaking and childrearing. The problem is they don't seem to have very good intellectual resources for waging the struggle. The practical, material resources are probably there--they are well educated (at least Frank is), intelligent, they make a good impression, while not rich they are far from destitute. But they are hampered by all kinds of romantic illusions, illusions that keep them from coming up with a plausible escape plan, or making the most of the hand they are dealt. They are tormented by the idea that they are not living up to their best selves (and this is true) but they have utterly self-deluding notions about what their best selves are or how to bring them into being. They are so afraid of being corrupted by their environment that they hold themselves aloof from the life around them. Their aversion is largely aesthetic, but the pop psychological and sociological theories they use to explain to themselves why they are alienated are inadequate to the task. They want to lead lives of significance, but the best they can do is to concoct a vague and implausible scheme of moving to France, where the plan is for April to work as a secretary while Frank sits around the apartment trying to figure out what to do with himself. I mean, if they want to do something worthwhile with their lives, Frank could become a teacher, or, at the other end of the scale, go to work for the kind of high-powered advertising firm portrayed in Mad Men (he graduated Columbia and has a way with words). April could have, at the very least, volunteered to work at the NAACP.    Yates is an extremely accomplished prose stylist. He's a master of the vivid, transparent prose style that is the gold standard for writers of realistic fiction. He nails the details of life among the white middle class in the mid-to-late 50's, while at the same time painting it as a more complicated and conflicted time than popular stereotypes would have you believe. He has an extraordinary ability to make you feel like you are deep inside the consciousness of his characters while at the same time watching them from a great distance. And the central dilemma his characters face--how to live a worthwhile life in a world that often conspires against it--is not one that will go out of fashion any time soon.	2008-05-10

There is nothing more human then the raw emotional validity experienced when reading `Revolutionary Road'; a novel so steeped in what makes us a society you almost forget your reading a work of fiction on not the monologues of your own existence.<br /><br />The novel introduces us to Frank and April Wheeler, a young family living in Connecticut in the mid-1950s.  Frank works an office job he loathes and doesn't even completely understand, but the pay is good and that makes up for it.  April, once a free spirit, has become trapped in her suburban life with children she didn't plan on having and friends she can't remember liking to begin with.  Both Frank and April are living the American Dream, but that `dream' is not their own but the one forced on them by the consensus of society.  It's what everyone around them aspires to for reasons they can't even finger.  The apathy and frustration brought on by this unhappiness has begun to fray their marriage and so when we meet the Wheelers they are really at their breaking points.  In fact the first few pages bring about an explosive and violent argument that sets the tone for the rest of the novel.<br /><br />`Revolutionary Road' is the type of story that reaches to the pit of a person because it is so real and so believable that you find yourself instantly relating to the premise.  No relationship is perfect or `holy' and so when you read of the Wheeler's problems and concerns you realize that many of them are your own.  Their regrets and longings can be found in many of us and so that helps make this novel all the more `important'.<br /><br />At times `Revolutionary Road' can read like a black comedy for there are many details that play quite humorous, but like I've seen in novels like Tom Perrotta's `Little Children', it's the humor that ends up being the most heart breaking.  Most of life's humor is just a mask to hide the pain and frustration of reality.<br /><br />As Frank and April tackle the decision to pick up and leave this life behind, escape to a life that is better suited to their own dreams they find that this life is not so easy to leave behind.  As much at it repels them it refuses to let them escape and they find themselves enslaved to it in a way, prisoners of their own existence.  No one they talk to understands their motives for leaving everything behind.  They look at them like they are crazy; but most of these reactions are selfish in themselves.  As Frank and April seclude themselves their relationship becomes misleading as they appear to draw closer to one another; but unhappiness always leads to bitterness, and bitterness can only be masked for so long before it bares itself in disastrous ways.<br /><br />The ending of `Revolutionary Road' is as stunning as it is horrific, as fitting as it is unmercifully unjust.  It will leave you speechless yet elicit much debatable conversation.<br /><br />What makes truly great literature is the ability to connect with a person, and Richard Yates obviously understood that.  `Revolutionary Road' borrows beneath the skin and exposes our deepest darkest secrets.  It becomes a part of us, or we become a part of it; and that, my friends, is what a remarkable treat.e to a life that is better suited to their own dreams they find that this life is not so easy to leave behind.

I can be distrustful of hype when it surrounds a book, so all the praise for this one I read in advance left me a little wary.  I was happy to discover that all the acclaim is well deserved.  Yates really was a marvelous writer.  His style is clear, seemingly effortless, piercingly sharp and witty in surprising ways.  You can definitely see the influence of Yates' idol F. Scott Fitzgerald, but Yates was plainer (in a good way.)  Kurt Vonnegut compared \\"Revolutionary Road\\" to [[ASIN:0743273567 The Great Gatsby]]; but another good likeness would be to Vonnegut's own superb [[ASIN:0385334206 Breakfast of Champions]] with those two books' black humor, bluntness, and tragic view of life.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see how fans of [[ASIN:B000ANVQ0K Titanic (Three-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]] heartthrobs Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet react to them playing Frank and April Wheeler in the forthcoming movie version of \\"Revolutionary Road.\\"  These are two of the most difficult and, some would say, psychologically compromised characters in American fiction.  Yates' biographer in [[ASIN:0312423756 A Tragic Honesty: The Life and Work of Richard Yates]] wrote that Yates' joking, working title for his novel was \\"The Bullsh*t Artist\\"  and that fits Frank Wheeler.  He is an appalling jackass in his lies and betrayals of family and friends.  April proves to be his chief victim, but she is also a desolate instance of a soul arrested in development by emotional deprivation.  What makes your heart break for them despite their flaws is Yates' unerring sense of human commonality.  Apparently many find this novel difficult to read because it strikes too close to home.  You can definitely see your own defects in Frank and April without looking too hard.<br /><br />Although the supposed subject in this novel is the musty old gripe about 1950's American conformity, I think Yates' indictment was not really about America but the human condition itself.  Yates work is a powerful depiction of a certain place and time.  You really see the sights and smell the smells, as it were.  One can see the spiritual desolation of the time and why from certain perspectives what Tom Wolfe called \\"The Third Great (Spiritual) Awakening\\" in American history during the '60's and '70's was necessary and even desirable.  But Yates real theme was the inability of people to understand and put into words what their experience means.  You can see this clearly in the chilling little prologue to Part Three of \\"Revolutionary Road\\" where in a few well chosen paragraphs Yates demonstrates the insufficiency of language to describe eternity.  Over and over again the characters find themselves playing roles that they have stumbled into, using words they don't mean.  At the end of the novel one character thinks some Hemingway-like thoughts about how \\"the whole point of crying was to quit before you cornied it up.  The whole point of grief was to cut it out while it was still honest, while it still meant something.  Because the thing was so easily corrupted: let yourself go and you started embellishing your own sobs or you started telling about (them) with a sad sentimental smile and saying (he) was courageous, and then what the hell did you have?\\"  This is as close as the book comes to a credo.  Readers will have to make up their own minds whether that's enough; or whether their are spiritual, moral solutions to the terrible problems that beset Frank and April.  When I finished the novel I really was at a loss for words.  The closest feelings I had were back when I first finished William Styron's [[ASIN:B000GQHQJ6 Sophie's Choice]].  (Styron was another great tragedian who admired this novel.)  Fans of American fiction should not miss this one.  It deserves to be up there on the shelf with old F. Scott.erican fiction should not miss this one.  It deserves to be up there on the shelf with old F. Scott.	2008-02-26

Frank and April Wheeler are an attractive middle-class couple living in suburban Connecticut. On the outside, they appear to have it all: a lovely home, two beautiful children...basically a picture-perfect life. Behind closed doors, though, neither Frank nor April are happy with themselves or with each other. Frank has been stuck in the same mindless job for years, and April feels like she's just waiting around for her life to start. Both of the characters seek comfort outside of their marriage, but ultimately decide that the best thing to do is to pack up their family and move to Europe for a chance at a completely fresh start. Unfortunately, things don't go according to plan, and Frank and April continue on a downward spiral of lies, anger, and resentment, until tragedy ultimately ensues.<br /><br />I liked this book, but it was depressing as hell to read. Still, author Richard Yates offers an interesting perspective on the American dream, and even though \\"Revolutionary Read\\" was written more than 40 years ago, its overriding message about being disenchanted with life is something that will strike a chord with all readers, regardless of the time period they happen to be living in.	2007-11-28

Read Couples after Revolutionary Road and see what I mean, but let's face it: Yates is head and shoulders above the latest Post-Modern's whoever.  No, Yates was a storywriter in the Realism School.  He reminds me a bit of a contemporary, Walker Percy (The Moviegoer)  Where Percy's character's find or at least try to find God in 1950's New Orleans's, Yates', April and Frank never actually get a foot into church.  Their New York City Suburb is a purgatory of lawn mowers and suburban strivers. The 1950's dream, the migration into country homes, a cookie cutter cul-de-sac, it becomes The Hell. A bit romantic or over fevered this distrust of The American Dream?  Yes, but it seemed so real in the dark crevices of the Eisenhower years.  The intellectuals had read The Great Gatsby and Fitzgerald seemed to be a sage though his characters were definitely not the middle class. By the 50's there was the new weekend-leisure class, a poor cousin of Fitzgerald's protagonists.  The wishful world envisioned by April (not unlike Gatsby's muse), a girl that just can't seem to get to that next level where art and life come together in exquisite excellence; the disillusioned mother won't bring a baby into the holocaust of husband, home, and Leave It to Beaver.

Yates unflinchingly peels apart what it is like to be in your thirties, unsure of who you are and what you're supposed to be doing,  convinced that you're not living the life you were intended to lead.  The novel is also a brilliant character study of two people trapped in a marriage and in a life that neither wants, and how their self-deception leads to self-destruction.  The writing here is fantastic - it's urbane and cuts deep, yet is completely accessible and is full of sharp, caustic wit.

Richard Yates responds with a deeply disturbing counterportrait of what often happens behind closed doors: couples quarreling, and people who do not know how to communicate caringly.    Frank and April Wheeler look like the beautiful young couple that everyone dreams that they could be. They have it all: two beuatiful kids, a nice house, a steady income, and good friends.     But behind closed doors, you have binge drinking, nasty fighting, adultery, and thoughts of death and suicide.     The book is well written and carefully crafted. The couples in the book use a lot of profanity, particularly the expressions \\"G-d D--n,\\" and \\"Je-us,\\" which is interesting if only to highlight how these two persons are not involved in the lives of these people at all, except as terms of blasphemy.    The book's shattering conclusion will stay with you just as it does with Milly and Shep and Mrs. Givings.

Yates gives it to you straight, but in a way that's universal.<br /><br />It can be put more simply. You will laugh.  You will cry. Some of that will be from what actually happens within Revolutionary Road. Most of it will be because Yates can pull on heartstrings like no other writer.  This book represents an incredible writer at his best.	2007-06-08
US	49577356	R24J2NQVOSPU77	0375708448	840034938	Revolutionary Road	Books	5	7	7	N	N	The good intentions that paved the "Road" to hell	It is a suburban town populated with people with good intentions. But as we all know, the road to hell was paved with the acts of this kind of folks. Among those good acts is a play. It was supposed to be something simple, nice and sweet. A group of amateur  actors join to produce a play called \\"The Petrified Forest\\". But everything goes terrible wrong. Actually, embarrassingly wrong.<br /><br />This is the very first chapter of Richard Yates's \\"Revolutionary Road\\". This beginning sets the mood for the whole novel: something simple that was supposed to work fine, but ends terribly bad. The presentation of the play works as a metaphor for the Wheelers' marriage. They could be happy, but inner and outer forces force them to have a miserable life.<br /><br />Young, beautiful, with two lovely kids and with enough money to live peacefully, April and Frank Wheeler seem to be the perfect couple at the surface. But, as Yates allows us to see under the roof of their home, one learns that they have emotional issues that are destroying their union.<br /><br />The strongest force to separate them is the post-War melancholy. They can't relate to anyone else, let alone to each other. April and Frank has drifted apart, and what is left is emotional abuse that may destroy everything.<br /><br />Yates paints a portrait of a relationship that has no place to survive anymore. April doesn't love Frank any more - has she ever loved him?. Neither does he. So why do these people are still married? It was the time, it was the commodity of being together. The kids are a good excuse too. On the other hand, all this self-abuse has reached its peak, and they may not tolerate each other until the end of the narrative.<br /><br />\\"Revolutionary Road\\" reminds us of what the good prose is capable of doing. As Yates is painting his characters in their time, he is also painting us. Human beings are the same, no matter what, when or where. Always unsatisfied.	2007-05-13

US	13423226	R6HDSICY4TOFB	0375708448	840034938	Revolutionary Road	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Revolutionary Road is a must read	I picked up Revolutionary Road after reading a recent book review. I was not disappointed in Yates' classic book about a suburban couple trying to make sense of their lives as individuals and as a married couple. Even though the book is now 40+ years old it still has a great deal of truth about suburbia and the constant search for identity among people today.     Frank and April Wheeler (the main characters) have two children, but Yates quickly unfolds a plot in which both are faking their way thru a marriage and thru life. Frank Wheeler has become part of a huge bureaucracy and drones thru his days waiting for lunch and to home in the afternons while his wife is listless and wants more for herself and her future. They both make plans that amount to nothing and other characters (The Campbells, the Givings, etc...) are all people who are caught up in appearances and attempts to live the American dream (whatever that is). The book is sometimes funny, sometimes peculiar and sometimes tragic, but it never lets you down.     The book is bitter in many ways, but Yates writing style keeps you focused and the book could have easily been written in this decade given the psychological \\"angst\\" the people in the book suffer. It's a great read and worth the time/effort to pick up a copy.	2006-12-31

And the theme he wrestles with, that all of us long to be \\"first rate\\" but lack the courage to define and authenticate our lives, is poignantly familiar to us all.  As strivers who need external validation of our notions of success, we are more content to please our peers than to risk their disapproval and alienation. So we become the very bland stereotypes of mediocrity Frank and April Wheeler revile in their private conversations, contemptuous stage whispers that only underscore the depth of their own self-loathing.  The looming, inevitable tragedy of the Wheelers makes societal rubberneckers of us all...theirs is a slow-motion car crash we can't take our eyes off of.  To put the reasons for the Wheelers' crack-up in perspective, it helps to remember the words of Joan Didion who, while crediting the insights of Betty Friedan's \\"Feminine Mystique,\\"  recognized that \\"it is possible for people to be the unconscious instruments of values they would strenuously reject on a conscious level...\\" Neither April or Frank or any of the other main characters has the courage to leave the vapid predictability of their emotional cul-de-sac sane and alive. Richard Yates knows where staying on their familiar road will take them, and it is anything but revolutionary.  The irony is not lost on us; it is the neighborhood, and the nation, we have resigned ourselves to live in.	2006-09-03

Yates's narration is so free of gimmicks and flows so easily from the mind of one character to another that the reader is hardly aware in any conscious way of a switch. What I also found heartening in this book, and what reaffirms my love of literature, is Yates's way of getting at the subtleties of thought. When we see Frank Wheeler slip into a bit of negative thinking, fall for his own self-pity, or get caught up in bit of fantasy, we recognize that same trait in our method of thinking. This is what literature does best, or what makes great literature. What we read should remind us of who we are, awaken us to our own characteristics. <br />Revolutionary Road­ is particularly depressing because of its similarities to real life. We are given moments of fleeting hope, of grand aspirations that disappear in the drudgery of everyday life. As much as the novel is the story of how the suburbs consume those who thought they might be better it is also a story of how love fails the lovers. Not one thing amounts to as much as we initially make of it, and this is the truth that Yates gives us in this novel and the truth that I appreciate.	2006-08-10
US	36880260	R2A6O1XMBG3R2Z	0375708448	840034938	Revolutionary Road	Books	5	7	7	N	N	A Writer's Writer	Richard Yates is by far one of the best writers of the past 50 years. His work, other than Revolutionary Road had been underappreciated until the mid-1990's when people started reading his short fiction again. But Revolutionary Road is his masterpiece. Yates is a master storyteller whose work is, as many other reviewers have already said, is timeless. <br /> <br />This book revolves around Columbia graduate Frank and his wife April Wheeler and their suburban lives. Each feels unfulfilled in his or her own way, Frank, someone who while at Columbia is always told great things are in store for him after he graduates and figures out what he wants to do with his life, and April, who mourns an acting career that never took off and instead leaves her pining away her days as a bored housewife. What is remarkable about this work is its ability to capture the trapped feeling one gets when faced with the reality of one's mundane existence. Something always seems just  out of reach for these two and everytime you think their will be a change in their fortune, something happens to leave them right where they started.  <br /> <br />I cannot emphasize enough how fantastic this book is. As someone who studied creative writing, Yates amazes me with the rich texture of his language and the way he captures a person's mindset so perfectly.  <br /> <br />Add this book to the many you must always have at your side.	2006-06-15
US	51304688	R3UO76JHV5USVS	0375708448	840034938	Revolutionary Road	Books	5	17	17	N	N	Little Boxes	I had to keep looking at the copyright date of this book to make sure it really was published in 1961 instead of 2001; Yates so perfectly constructs its period that it's fun to ponder how brutally honest \\"Revolutionary Road\\" must have seemed when it first appeared on bookshelves. In this tale chronicling the now cliched \\"dark side of suburbia\\", Yates brilliantly narrates the story of April and Frank Wheeler, characters who exist in 1955 yet whose internal struggles are timeless.  Yates casts a wary, but never harshly judgemental, eye on the post-War American rituals of the cocktail hour, bridge games with neighbors, the obsession with having a well-trimmed lawn and turns them inside out, revealing the often ugly truths underneath, much in the way Grace Metalious had on rural life a few years earlier with \\"Peyton Place\\".<br /><br />But Yates does more with the story than write a simple blow by blow account of a family's disintegration; the author's prose is some of the most descriptive and lyrical that I have come across in some time.  Yates assigns such tragic weight to the Wheeler household, and the  environs of their developing Connecticut suburb, so deeply that the fall of this family could have occurred on Faulkner's watch.<br /><br />I think almost every generation belives they have been the ones to \\"discover\\" the ugly truths of suburban life; that it can be bland and soulless, when more attention is paid to the material needs and the individual triumphs in his own isolation.  The truth is that these ideas and more have been a critique of the United States suburban developments since they were first developed en masse in the post-war boom.  This novel anticipates books like Betty Friedan's 1963 polemic, \\"The Feminine Mystique\\", a book one can easily imagine April Wheeler devouring, and the social tumult of the 1960s.<br /><br />It is amazing how contemporary this novel *still* feels in the era of McMansions and SUV's. There persists in many that uncomfortable feeling; that though one may think we're above it all, that we are smarter or more cultured than our neighbors, the underlying fear that we are really just the same as everybody else is an unspoken fear that \\"Revolutionary Road\\" taps into perfectly.  It mights make us a little uncomfortable, but a shake up in our consciousness can always be good.<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel immensely and am glad Yates is getting some posthumous recognition as an important American writer.e may think we're above it all, that we are smarter or more cultured than our neighbors, the underlying fear that we are really just the same as everybody else is an unspoken fear that \\"Revolutionary Road\\" taps into perfectly.

The characters' neurosis begins to manifest itself and you realize what is truly at work in this ostensibly insipid setting.

While \\"Revolutionary Road\\" is often viewed as a commentary on suburban life in the 1950's, that is not how I look at it.  Neither the Wheelers  who are its focus, nor the two other couples who are important to the novel, are at all representative of the average suburban couple.  I view Revolutionary Road as an exploration of a flawed marriage between flawed people.  The Wheelers married before they had transitioned from youthful expectations and illusions, and neither partner is ready to make sacrifices in behalf of the other.  Their discussions, in which each tries to transform what he/she wants to do as being the best for both of them, sometimes border on the hilarious, but we are laughing at them, not with them.  Yet Yates makes these characters sympathetic and interesting. Yates does not do as well with their friends, but there is a grown up son with mental issues who is a great secondary character.  From my own experience, the son is realistic.  While he is a sad individual, his complete frankness and lack of tact, along with his acuity, is a loose cannon it is sometimes fun to watch in action.  Yate's writing is not showy, but he nails emotional nuances.	2005-10-31

Stylistically it's impeccable, more tightly constructed and better worded than just about any novel I've read.  All the characters feel vibrantly alive, even the minor ones.  Yates's understanding of humanity is almost unmatched; that this manages to be such an incredibly poignant book while dealing with the most mundane aspects of mid-twentieth century suburban life is quite remarkable.  The satire is sharp without interfering with the reader's empathy for the characters, though because the story is so thoroughly depressing one may overlook much of the humor.  The ending is devastating, as many reviewers have noted, yet even the simplest sentence-to-sentence transitions are often painfully observant.  A book to learn from and cherish.	2005-08-02
US	52566110	R1ZLNBWOGZCG4N	0375708448	840034938	Revolutionary Road	Books	5	64	66	N	N	A Terrible Honesty	When you say the name Richard Yates today you usually get blank stares. If you say Bellow, Cheever, Updike, Roth or Styron you get knowing nods. Yet Yates, to my mind, is easily the equal to any of the aforementioned names and belongs on the same literary shelf. He failed to find a wide and general fame before he died in 1992 (though, I believe, this book was up for the National Book Award in 1961 alongside Catch-22), and it is only recently that his name is being revived. He is revered by writers such as Tobias Wolff and Andre Dubus (who was a student of Yates').<br /><br />Without Yates there is no Raymond Carver; he was the natural heir to Fitzgerald and mentor to those writers willing to take up a dangerous literary thread: the exploration of the depths of our self-delusion, our virtually incessant need for self-validation, and most importantly, our progressive moral disintegration. Never flashy in his style, nor even particularly poetic or lyrical, spare in his descriptions which seem, in spite of their austere quality, to strike the mark with a terrible sharpness, Yates was a great genius of plain prose. His writing is like a bear trap, hidden in the leaves, waiting to slam shut and catch the reader completely unawares. This kind of writing should have gained a wider readership, but it did not. Perhaps because, like the bear trap, when it closes on you, it hurts.<br /><br />I myself had not been aware of Yates at all (something a writer friend found incomprehensible) until it was suggested I read Revolutionary Road. I read it, and I still have not recovered. Revolutionary Road is considered by many to be Richard Yates' best work. I think it is probably that and a lot more.<br /><br />This book is one of the most powerful works of fiction I have ever read and certainly belongs in the company of the best American fiction written after WWII. I say that without hyperbole. Yates was as close to genius as any of his contemporaries, and this book in particular is written so close to the bone that, after I had finished it I wondered how Yates himself survived the effort. Apparently he did, but only just. I do not know if I have ever used the word masterpiece in any of my Amazon reviews; I don't think so. I would like to use it now. This book is a masterpiece. This book reads like a string of thoughts coming from inside the reader's own mind. It's that good. And the end is so powerful that I found myself weeping. I felt as though I had been waylaid, sucker punched. I did not expect anything like that to happen.<br /><br />Having said that, it should not be thought that this book is some kind of \\"downer.\\" It is way beyond those kinds of simplistic descriptions, besides which, it is often very funny. The portraits of middle-class American people of the 1950's are concise and devastatingly honest. Depending upon where you are in your own life at the time you read it, it will obvously have different effects. Some people may hate it. For me it was nothing short of life-changing. I know that sounds exaggerated, but that is the effect this great work had on me. I encourage anyone who is interested in what great fiction writing really is supposed to be to read Revolutionary Road. Along with all these tags I have used, great, genius, masterpiece, etc., it should be remembered that the writing in Revolutionary Road is extremely accessible. The sentences flow effortlessly, the book has its own momentum.<br /><br />It should not be taken - from this review - that Revolutionary Road is one more swipe at an old and obvious target, the  alienated middle class suburbians who have had a bullseye on their backs for generations of authors, nor is it merely another scathing attack on the emotionally-removed characters of the soul-barren Fifties (though I must take pains here to mention that the author himself said exactly that, \\"I meant it more as an indictment of American life in the nineteen-fifties.\\")  While this is certainly a clear enough statement and we should take the author at his word, as a reader I have to take exception to this extent: the layers and depths Yates has uncovered propose - I believe - a greater intellectual and emotional map than even he had intended. While it is, as he says, an \\"indictment,\\" it is also a deeply compassionate book. The author's own pain at writing this shows a soul who is both furiously angry and filled with loathing yet desperately and almost fatally loving. So great is his skill that both these irresolvably conflicted emotions are able to co-exist on the page. Yates knew this life, and he seems to feel what the people he writes about here feel. He is not superior to his characters but lives in their skin. Rather than taking a broad brush to it, he goes at it with a finer tool and teases up the nuances so often lacking in the more obvious fiction of the genre. Once I had read the first sentence I felt a kinship with the writer. I was hooked. I hope this happens for you.<br /><br />NB: I have altered the last paragraph of my review slightly in order to include some of the information and insights which I have recently gained as a result of having read the brilliant and searing biography of Yates by Blake Bailey called, \\"A Tragic Honesty\\". I do suggest that the reader familiarize himself with Yates's work first by reading three or four of his novels and his collection of short stories before tackling this very well-written (and in its own right, painfully revealing) biography.at his word, as a reader I have to take exception to this extent: the layers and depths Yates has uncovered propose - I believe - a greater intellectual and emotional map than even he had intended.

They have a nice house, Frank has a job that is not too demanding and they have two small kids, so in essence all a couple can wish. Except, that they are not happy at all: April has not become the actress she wanted to be, they consider their neighbours and friends to be narrow-minded and they have fights over small matters that become so big that it is practically impossible to cope with it. In a last attempt to escape April decides that the family will move to Europe: she will work and Frank will finally have time to develop his talents. Frank does not exactly want to go, but he does not know how to tell his wife. And so the family heads for disaster without anybody noticing or knowing what to do about it.<br />This book was written in 1961, was nominated for big prizes together with such classics as Catch-22 and was forgotten after that.

He was doing his best to reconstruct the quarrel in his mind but it was hopeless. He couldn't even tell whether he was angry or contrite, whether it was forgiveness he wanted or the power to forgive. His throat was still raw from shouting and his hand throbbed from hitting the car-he remembered that part well enough-but his only other memory was of the high-shouldered way she had stood in the curtain call, with that false, vulnerable smile, and this made him weak with remorse.\\"<br />Nonetheless, the third section of \\"Revolutionary Road\\" moves from the internal life of the characters to a drama between the characters.

Another unmasking of the banality of the suburbs and the bland conformity of the 50s didn't strike me as particularly appealing or necessary.  Both of those things have been unmasked so often that I wonder why anyone bothers with either; there's nothing left to expose.  <br />The choice of target is also a little unfair: first, hypocrisy and small-mindedness are not localized in the suburbs to the extent that authors and filmmakers seem to think.  If a writer deliberately populates his story with caricatured materialistic bourgeois, then he shouldn't expect it to be a legitimate criticism of the age.   In any case, if an audience can separate themselves too easily from the people being described, the book has no sting - like American Beauty had no sting.  A real work of art should hurt a little.<br />But Revolutionary Road was not what I expected from the reviews.  Yates knows all of the pitfalls of the standard send-up of the middle class: the main characters in his story are not the usual suburban types, but people who consider themselves better than the dull people in their neighborhood; they mock the people that we, as readers, are so used to mocking, and become our surrogates.  <br />The real theme of this book is much deeper, and it transcends the era and even the plot of the book: what do people do when they are intelligent and spirited enough not to be satisfied with the conformity and blandness of their surroundings, but lack the drive to ever escape mediocrity, because they are, fundamentally, much more a part of their environment than they imagine?<br />The tragedy of this book is the discovery that you are, after all, perhaps not as extraordinary as you thought - and that has sting, because all of us, at some time, have thought that we were a bit better than the people around us, and most of us have realized with horror (although the realization doesn't always stick around) thatwe aren't as different, as far above them, as we thought.  Many of the moments in this book stick with you because they remind you of those moments when you came face to face with your own mediocrity, and challenges you to either be honest with yourself about what you are, or try sincerely to fulfill the ambitions that you have pursued so halfheartedly until now.<br />It's a hard lesson to deal with: I can tell why this book didn't sell.  The writing, by the way, is beautiful; scene after scene springs effortlessly to life, and you can't tell how much skill is involved until you go back and read it again.<br />I remember reading once that Yates - against the advice of his publishers - called this book Revolutionary Road because it seemed to him that the promise of the nation was petering out in the 50s, that the ambition and hope that had marked its founding had slowly led to a dead-end of uninspired and uninspiring prosperity (for some people, at least) - that the end of the revolutionary road had been reached.<br />This is overstated, and Yates's vision often seems to me unaccountably dark, as if he was blind to everything but his thesis.  Something about his outlook is right, though; the problem with the society isn't necessarily that it's hypocritical or conformist or mediocre, but that it produces people with such a horrible gap between aspiration and capacity - it gives them the leisure and intelligence to want a fuller life while robbing them of the backbone to get it.	2003-10-28

A recent biography has surmised that his refusal to insert happy Hollywood endings to his novels, which made adaptions of his books difficult, might have compounded the problem.  If American Beauty was written and set in the 1950's, Yates would have been the guy to write it.<br />Revolutionary Road is regarded by most (including Richard Ford in his excellent introduction) as Yates' masterpiece, a devastating look at the crumbling marriage and empty lives of a middle class couple living in the suburbs.  Frank Wheeler has a well-paying but mind-numbing job in the city, where he carries on a half-hearted affair with an office secretary.  His wife April is a bored housewife, after her effort to join a new theater group fails miserably in one of the novel's greatest (and most uncomfortable) moments.<br />Frank and April enlist the services of the same shady, over-eager realtor who convinced them to move to the suburbs, and try to sell their house so they can move to Paris and start afresh.  April and Frank seem to both doubt whether they will actually go through with the move, but their lives seem so empty to them in the suburbs they cling to the hope of a better life overseas.<br />Overall, the book is intense and yet very readable,  kind of a cross between Jonathan Franzen and a middle class Great Gatsby. The Wheelers see that green light but aren't going to reach it either.  I loved the scenes between April and Frank as they drove home from the ill-fated local theater premier, in which April seethes with anger and disappointment, and anything Frank says to try and help turns out to be exactly the wrong thing to say. You feel unsettled just reading the chapter, yet you can't put it down, like the desire to look at a car accident.<br />I am amazed that this book only recently came back into print, since the book seems as relevant today as 50 yearsago when it was written.  Maybe Oprah will rescue it in her rejuvenated book club.  Yates, the very embodiment of the destructive personality, was a chain-smoking alcoholic, who rarely ate anything but red meat. He put everything he had into Revolutionary Road, and it deserves to be read and re-read by modern readers.  Highly recommended.	2003-08-29

Yes, it's a scathing indictment of the emptiness at the heart of corporate capitalist suburban, status-seeking America but--as more than one perceptive reviewer had noted--it is, at base, an existential novel. April and Frank Wheeler aren't just suffering from suburban malaise; they're trying to battle the same nihilism that all intelligent people begin to battle once they look behind Oz's curtain and discover that the success game is a puerile illusion, a figleaf that cannot adequately cover up life's essential absurdity. In other words, this is a book that stares into the abyss--and the abyss stares back to horrifying effect. If you're not a conventional dullard, or don't want to be one, read this book. It may blast your life wide open, or just confirm dark truths you already know but keep under your hat for fear of being branded a naysayer and pessimist: a taboo thing to be in a society demanding that (to paraphrase Peter D. Kramer) we always be &quot;happy and productive&quot; even though life calls for a more complex response...	2003-07-25

REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is as well written and intriguing a book as you're ever likely to read - a true modern classic.  The plot concerns the increasingly unhappy marriage between surbanites Frank and April Wheeler.  Many other authors have explored similar territory, notably John Updike (e.g., \\"Couples\\").  However, no one has done so with such deft and beautiful writing.  The plot is ultimately somewhat incidental, and you'll likely figure out the resolution quite early.  However, the brilliantly realized characters, including friends and neighbors of the Wheelers, make the book so worthwhile.<br /><br />The meaning of the book is likely to vary for different readers; for example, many people may see a scathing yet subtle indictment of suburban life and values.  However, I read it more as as screed against the dangers of being unnecessarily dissatisfied with your life, particularly expecting brilliance where none exists.  Whatever meaning you attribute to the novel, it's extraordinary.  Most highly recommended!!!	2003-06-28

If you are a writer, if you even fancy yourself a bit ot a word-smith, you need to pick up this book.  I consider myself a pretty well-read guy, and I have never read anything more technically sound, more painstakingly thought out, or more tediously true and on point.  Yates uses a cast of characters that all delicately mesh together.  Either they somehow share the same worldview, or the same idiosycnricies or share similar heartaches or just plain have dramatic, traumatic lives.  In short, his characters are distinctly, almost painfully humane and fully round.  And Yates takes the time to develop each character from the inside out and then back outside to in.  I guess it's harder to explain than I expected but, trust me, this book is a tremendous read.  Richard Yates' is a wrier's writer if that's what you want to call him.  He leaves the reader saying \\"what he just did there, that point of view switch, that throughline, is f-ing amazing!\\"  He blew me away.  And the dialogue is effortless and perfect.  You will love this tale, mostly becuase of the characters, but hidden between the lines is a beautiful little lesson in love.	2003-04-29

It is the type of fiction that feels like an old blanket and the feel of the pearly winter sun on a childhood morning. I did not grow up in the fifties, but I cannot help but love this novel. The characters' indiscretions are complex and tragic; their unattainable goals and blase ideas (moving to Paris and write thirty years after those WWI expatriates) are heartbreakingly authentic. This novel has aged better than anything else I have read from the last fifty years. It is too bad that it has not become as well-received as Hemingway and Faulkner's classics. Be that as it may, as I grow old I will have this novel beside Moby Dick, Madame Bovary and the short stories of Anton Chekov.	2002-12-13

To read it is to see the world of 1955 without the usual props and gimmicky idealization. Revolutionary Road is Richard Yate's greatest novel--subtle and  realistic, it touches notions we rarely ponder: the Wheelers are not happy in ways that are seldom explored by suburbanites of early 21st century America. They have a sense of longing for something better. Irrepressibly and arrogantly, they aspire to a fallicious and outdated vision-becoming American expatriots in Paris. Their dreams lead to a tragedy unsettling and somehow touching.  If this is not the Great American Novel, I do not know what is. Thankfully, Yates does not make use of Heller's satire and Vonnegut's post-modern meanderings; instead, Yates explores the suburban dystopia without these ironic flourishes and sophomoric condemnations. He is Cheever without the poetry--a veritable Chekov of twentieth century America. This heart-wrenching story of foibles is as relevant today as it was in the fifties or 1961 when it was written. I realize that comparisons to great works have become de rigeur, but I must say that when I first encountered Yates, I felt as I had when I first discovered the works of William Faulkner or Franz Kafka. In retrospect, it is unfortunate that more will not have the pleasure of reading the Trial, Moby Dick or Revolutionary Road.	2002-09-21

With no belief system (philosophical, religious or otherwise) the characters in this novel flounder about helplessly looking for personal gratification, and come up empty. Convinced that they are, (or should be), superior to everyone else, they cannot find happiness or fulfillment in &quot;ordinary life&quot;. When they see (as they inevitably must) that they are human and have flaws, they cannot face them. Instead they are plunged into self-loathing and despair, and the resulting behavior makes the situation much worse. These characters need to grow up, look outside of themselves and try to give to others, but they are too neurotic and self-absorbed. Thus, I was left feeling numb and sad. The writing is excellent, and rings true because so many in our society (both today, and in the 1950's when this was written) share this unfortunate perspective.

Revolutionary Road can still stun after all these years, revealing the truths and fears that we all have first as young adults and then as aging misanthropes. (After experiencing such failures of young adulthood what else could we become?) Every word in this book rings with sharp clarity. It's actually frightening. The laughter we may utter from time to time while reading is a gutteral knowing laugh, both hideous and satyr like.  We laugh from the pain--the heart ripping, gut twisting turn of events. No one deserves to live out these terrible &quot;truths,&quot; but unfortunately we often do. And Yates presents it all casually in simple language and very straight forward. . .I think it was Swift who said satire is a glass in which everyone sees everyone but himself. And though I wouldn't definitiively call this book satire, it comes close except one can't help but see him/herself, mucking around in this detritus. . . Read the book.

What makes Yates' dark, decidedly cynical look at the '50s in &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot; so compelling is that it was written just a few years after the era it portrays.<br />Despite the book's obvious attack on various institutions and conventions of the time that contribute to the Wheelers' disintegration, Yates' most poignant focus is on individual morality and choice: Frank and April Wheeler are clearly products of their own grim, misguided and abortive motivations, rather than victims of their repressive, tacky, dead-end suburban existence.<br />Despite the author's rather vicious, excessively lurid character development, despite his emphasis to the point of overkill how poorly adjusted Connecticut suburbanites were in the '50s, despite the sometimes preachiness of the narrative, this is nevertheless a &quot;lost&quot; classic, very much worthy of being compared to &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot;<br />While the general tone of &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot; is one of hard-nosed realism, it is at some points remarkably touching, an aspect of the novel about which I've yet read little.<br />There's even a little supernatural intimation toward the end that -- out of place in this stark book as it may seem -- is further indicative of how complex, contemplative a work this is.	2001-10-17

But the limp prose, tepid plot, and silly characters that constitute this alleged buried classic refute this.  The language is plain-spoken, which would be fine if the characterization and plot dazzled, which they don't.  Frank and April Wheeler and their irritatingly precious children never grow, but always whine.  They repeat themselves until they dissolve themselves.  Anatole Broyard, as Richard Ford points out in this edition's introduction, was irritated by an ambiguity of presentation in the novel; he asked whether we're to take the Wheeler's travails as tight-lipped realism or scathing symbolism.  It's clear why Broyard would wonder this, as Yates himself doesn't seem to know.  Yates' idea of irony is so creaky and silly one wonders how its self-consciousness slipped past the reviewers.  The Wheelers see themselves as bohemians, though they are ostensibly suburban and most of all when they protest against suburbia.  The Givings boy is &quot;crazy&quot; and institutionalized, yet he's the only one who speaks the sane &quot;truth.&quot;  Hum, hum.  Yates' intentions are so transparent and vapid that by novel's end you'll want to unearth your copy of J.D. Salinger's &quot;Nine Stories&quot; to remind yourself that compelling and thoughtful prose on 1950s America does exist.	2001-08-17

I even read what the &quot;critics&quot; had to say about the book.  My own reading of the book was a very personal experience: it was something between the author and me.  As I read the book, it reminded me of my first visit many years ago to a fine art photography gallery, which exhibited absolutely beautiful black &amp; white photographs.  I walked up to one particular photograph and remarked to the gallery owner, &quot;That's kind of depressing.&quot;  He responded, &quot;It could be.&quot;  I actually bought that photograph and now view it as a remarkable, beautiful rendering of fallen sequoias in Sequoia National Park.  Those sequoias exhibit all their &quot;majesty&quot; despite their continuing and, eventually, total decay.<br />Unlike many of the posted reviews and comments about Revolutionary Road, I did not view the book as a sort of depressing depiction of life in 50's suburbia.  Perhaps that is because I grew up in 50's - 60's suburbia, and as a 50+ year old can now look back on the day-to-day experiences described in this book as hilarious.  Only one other reviewer apparently saw what I did.  While many people lived their daily lives like this, you learn to roll with the punches, to persist, to rise above your circumstances, and even to look back with nostalgia.  It was a much simpler time.  Sound incredible?  Remember what the gallery owner told me before I purchased my first photograph!  Perhaps it is what we bring to the reading that matters.	2001-08-11

You know what the funniest thing about this book is? It's a friggin page-turner. Rev Road became an obsession -- I thought about it when I wasn't reading it, and if I wasn't reading it or thinking about it, it was because I was telling everyone what an incredible book it is.    Rev Road is funny as hell. I mean laugh out loud funny. The support characters are one-dimensional, cartoonish, even, but that's all right because that's what makes them so horrifying. This book is the essence of how we screws ourselves up each and every day and live with ourselves. It's about pain. It's about how much we want to hurt the ones we love.    For the fans of David E. Kelley, lemme tell you: Remember how fantastic the first three seasons of Picket Fences were? How the characters would say these things to each other that nobody would ever dare say, things that cut right to the bone? Now imagine that and multiply it by a hundred -- in quantity and quality.

True, and true.  If you haven't read it, do; but I wouldn't exactly say rush to do it.  Yates hasn't aged all that well; there's an Elia Kazan feel throughout, of exaggeration verging on melodrama, and while Yates is sometimes capable of superb observation, he seems devoid of genuine sympathy.  April Wheeler is better than her husband --more vital, more perceptive --but beyond that, emotionally damaged and corrosive.  Many of the characters verge on being, though brilliantly drawn, typological cartoons.  Nonetheless, there's a certain inexorable fascination in watching Yates send these people lurching into tragedy; and this book is very influential: given the durability of the suburbs, there will always be &quot;suburban prose-poets,&quot; and they will always do well to study Yates before plunking away.	2001-05-31

Much has been made of its 50's, suburban setting; yet the characters are timeless.  Frank &amp; April, Shep &amp; Molly, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Givings are alive and not-so-well and among us today.  One thing that struck me was the characters have been described as \\"materialistic.\\"  Compared to Americans of the 21st century, they only had the smallest notion of what true materialism is all about.  They seem curiously innocent in that respect.  <br />Richard Yates is a giant of a writer who will make his way to the short list of great authors of the 20th century.  His capturing of the momentary feeling, the basic sham of the faces we present to the world cut very close to the bone.  Frank Wheeler receives the worst drubbing from readers and critics, I believe because we all see ourselves in Frank, and do not like what we observe.  Frank is a man capable of introspection, and his small façade as an intellectual, brilliant misfit in a dead-end job is not despicable, only mediocre, and he sees his own mediocrity.  This is what makes us uncomfortable, and what is painful, we dislike.  Shep is the flip side of Frank, but his face to the world is one of a regular guy, straight talking, practical and dependable; he is truly a sensitive romantic who has thrown his life away to be someone he doesn't even like very well.  Somehow we forgive Shep, but not Frank.  Mr. Yates does not have the same sure hand with the females; they do not come to life like the men.  The use of John Givings, the mad man as the catalyst and truth-sayer is a brilliant novelistic device.<br />I thought of John Marquand and John Cheever who were roughly contemporaneous with Richard Yates.  They had many of the same concerns, but did not have the incisiveness, humor and depth of Yates. You not only will enjoy the read, but I am sure will want to re-read and reflect upon this powerful novel.	2001-05-26

What is actually the beguiling feature of this story is the effort Yates made to write an *existential novel*.  The story does involve two somewhat pretentious, and lost, young Americans but the real story is: how do you get *unlost*? The husband and wife have two very different answers to this question. the husband, who covets a reputation as a courageous intellectual, is forever pontificating to his wife about quitting the bourgeois scene and committing to a life of meaning, regardless of the penury that is in their future living in Europe without jobs.  The truth is, he is a terrible coward, and he sinks ever deeper into his meaningless existence (applied a little heavyhandedly by the author so the point won't be missed). He continues, however,talking ever louder about what he will do.  His wife, who finally understands what he is trying to say, takes him at face value and tries to enable his expressed aspirations. She feels the meaning in her life will come by her sacrifice so that he can finally realize his potential as a thinker. She becomes the embodiment of his putative dream and it is really his worst nightmare.  As she begins to understand the extent of his weakness it becomes hers as well.  The result is true tragedy, in heroic style, for both of them.                                            This is an effort to use the then popular understanding of *existentialism* i.e. Jean Paul Sartre, in an entertainment.  the standard notions of *engagement*  are used....  This was a difficult task for a writer to attempt and one Mr. Yates came close to managing.  It is unfortunate that what he was really up to isn't better understood.	2001-05-10

I bought it on my way home, and have since read all of Yates' work more than once.<br />Yates is a great writer.  Clear, simple, powerful.  Honest, unflinching, observant, funny.  He writes about the everyday tedium of office work better than anyone.  Most important, he writes honestly about human self-destruction.  <br />This is often seen as another indictment on suburban living.  But the 'burbs don't do anything evil here.  It is the characters who destroy themselves.  Self-delusion, selfishness, ego.  The fascinating thing about this painful story is how much we can relate to the characters.<br />The end is a bit over the top, but the journey is a pleasure.  Illuminating, entertaining, horrifying.  Read it.	2001-04-30
US	49575877	R213WSF27G3U9V	0375708448	840034938	Revolutionary Road	Books	3	32	45	N	N	Stale look at American suburbs	\\"Revolutionary Road\\": brilliant work of almost forgotten genius?  Nah.  I found it to be quite dull, actually.  It reminded me of Updike's \\"Run, Rabbit, Run,\\" or Joyce Carol Oates' \\"Them,\\" two other stale indictments of American suburban life.<br />I know scads of readers love Updike's Rabbit novels - and it's apparent by the glowing reviews of \\"Revolutionary Road\\" that scads also love Yates' work - but I find novels about suburban couples engaged in suburban angst and turmoil to be quite boring.  Sure, the conflicts resonate with us:  most of us struggle constantly with the image of ourselves, feel the biting pangs of self disappointment.  But the characters in these books go nowhere with their conflicts.  Whatever happened to the strong, interesting character?  The original suburban angst books, Bovary and Karenina, at least serve up a steamy dish of feminine sexuality, hinting at a passionate - and quite human --  underbelly in an otherwise orderly-seeming existence.<br />\\"Revolutionary Road\\" is primarily about Frank Wheeler, a self-inflated and self-proclaimed intellectual who works in the marketing department of some faceless corporation.  He lives with a babely wife, April, in a little white house in the suburbs of New York.  There's also children in the picture.  Frank says he hates his job; April hates being a housewife and wants to move to Europe.  In the end, Frank's cowardice and increasing interest in his job combine with a new Wheeler on the way to pin the two to their meaningless, dull little lives.  Hijinks ensue: adultery, heavy drinking, death, brown-nosing, visits from a madman, a little jazz, and some extended babysitting.<br />Okay, I'm going to reveal the ending now, so turn away if you don't want to see:  April basically offs herself in the end, because she can't deal anymore.<br />I hate this silly ending.  No central character makes any adjustment at all during the book.  April is the only character with any hope of changing, with any hope orvision for the future, and what happens?  The first obstacle in her path leads her to suicide.  Basically, it indicates that the writer couldn't imagine his way out of the conflict, and reflects lazy plotting.<br />Oh well.  You will hate this review, surely, because you're in love with the book.  I'm sorry.  I freely admit that my expectations projected onto the book led me to my disappointment.  I also admit that I am prejudiced against the suburban angst book, perhaps because it's a bit too close to home for my own comfort.  But there are dozens of excellent examples of better books touching on the same topic, from Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.,  to Don DeLillo.  Even Kerouac had something interesting to say about the human condition bent under the wheel of conformity...	2001-04-18

I was recommended this novel by a creative writing instructor I had in  college who would eventually publish his own short stories influenced by the beautiful writing and intriguing dialogue of this novel.  I have also modeled my own writing off the writing of Yates.<br />Revolutionary Road is one of those books that you cannot forget because the writing is so vivid and real and tangible and the dialogue and characters are so believable.  Revolutionary Road is a tragic, dark novel about a failing marriage and the artificiality and isolation of 1950's suburban life.  The characters are tragic but real, and possibly people you know or have known in your own life.  Richard Yates was probably the most underrated author of all time - an author with the talent of Hemingway and Faulkner but without the recognition of the public.  Hopefully, people will begin discovering the beauty of this novel and seek out two others which are out of print, the Easter Parade and a Good School.<br />I highly recommend this book.  If you have an appreciation for the written word, you will truly love it.	2000-12-27

This is undoubtably a classic work of American Literature.  Like all truly great books it anticipates the hordes of suburban writers that  would follow him and yet Yates always surpasses the best of them.  This  book should stand along side &quot;Lolita&quot;, &quot;The  Recognitions&quot; and &quot;Desperate Characters&quot; as the  the  greatest American novels of the past 50 years.	2000-07-11

In any case, this is a very well written novel about narcissists who have no love or affection for anyone in their  lives: not their parents, not their spouses, not their friends.  Most  startling is their indifference toward their own children.  These  characters look at their small children and, even as they go through the  motions of parenthood, don't even see them as anything other than burdens.   As I read Revolutionary Road, I kept thinking, what kind of people don't  love their own children?  I think it is significant that none of these  characters gives a thought to God or religion of any kind: no church on  Sunday, no wondering what God wants from all of them.  Actually, this book  is a good advertisement for fostering religiosity or spirituality of some  kind in one's life. Solipsistic angst may be inevitable for people who  don't, in the parlance of 2000, &quot;get over themselves&quot;.  The  writing warrants three stars for this novel, but I can't really recommend  Revolutionary Road.  Better that readers go back to Steinbeck or even  Fitzgerald and read about existential problems in a moral context.	2000-07-07

Of all of Yates works, this is his favorite, and he has often been quoted as saying he was \\"cursed to write his best book first.\\" The story of the Wheelers and  all of their shortcomings is not so much about everything that is wrong  with the suburbs, but everything that is wrong with many of the people who  live there.  Yates uses his knack for creating memorable, flawed characters  that make fascinating mess out of their very believable lives. Frank is the  perfect coward, who stays in a job he hates, cheats on his wife, and has no  relationship with his children, while his wife April is self-centered,  moody and does not want to take responsibiliy for her own life. The novel  is brilliantly constructed, and has peeripheral characters as interesting  and deep as the central ones. This book is as good as anything written in  the last 50 years. Unfortunately, Richard Ford's introduction offers  nothing to this edition, but it is still nice to see this great novel back  in print.	2000-07-05
US	53070409	R12NTNQZLBT7RF	0375708448	840034938	Revolutionary Road	Books	4	91	94	N	N	The American Dream	A good job, a pretty wife, nice kids, and a home in the suburbs. This novel, written in 1961, is about a couple that lives this American Dream. But this pre-yuppie pair leads a life of exquisite monotony. He hates his  white-collar job; she stays home with the kids. One of their most frequent  recreational activities is to visit with another similar couple, and spend  a few hours shaking their heads and complaining about how unevolved  everyone else is. We smile ruefully as we read about them, thinking how  common these folks are. Or have we fallen into a trap by putting ourselves  in the same place by looking down on Frank and April as they look down on  others.<br />Frank and April Wheeler look forward to things: a part in a  little theater play, a move to Paris, an affair, a promotion. It would  seem, though, that for them happiness is only in the anticipation of  events. The story's participants also are deeply into playing roles with  their spouses, their co-workers, their friends, and above all with  themselves. There is no one in this book that you want to identify with.  Why? Is it because they are poor, hopelessly lost dullards, or is it  because they represent us in too many unpleasant ways? It's a sad story,  but one that makes you think about your own life, and the ultimate value of  what you have accomplished. While some of our culture has changed since  this book was written (we no longer sit in hospital waiting rooms smoking  cigarettes), its theme is as modern as can be.	2000-05-25

I felt like it was an old timer's version of the novel by J. McInterney (sp?) &quot;Brightness Falls&quot;. &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot;, too,   is culturally-centric, almost to the point that it  satires neurotic behavior between young white couples in the 1950's from  educated backgrounds. The characterization is rigorious and the story  shocks like electricity at times. However, I got this feeling that the  author made his characters surrender before they had a chance to evolve.	2000-02-27

Biology states that disection kills, but this marriage was moribund from the onset.  Every  literary device is used, some rather artlessly disguised, complete with  raving but soothsaying madman.  Grippingly interesting , involving and  realistic.  In the end, no &quot;deus ex machina&quot; appears to save this  doomed couple.  Excellent read.	2000-02-27

The book is far superior to Man in the Gray Flannel Suit in terms of its character development and ending.  The characters, appropriately named April and Frank Wheeler, are proto-yuppies, surrounded  by shallow suburban values. (This was written in 1961 and takes place in  1955.)  I found the part where they reminisce about old radio shows of the  '30's interesting, putting to rest the notion that baby boomers were the  first generation to indulge in nostalgia.  I thought this would be a good  vehicle for Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.	2000-02-21

I liked the writing, but disliked the  characters, and never really accepted the author's cynical, bleak vision.   Is there no nobility, love, kindness, truth, authenticity, beauty, heroism  in the suburbs? If you think not, you will find validation in this book.	2000-02-18

I think, however, that Yates ends up taking a cheap  shot at suburbia as a whole, in much the same way that the film American  Beauty does. Not one adult character is likable, or even happy. The  Bohemian within suburbia is terminally unhappy (Frank and April), as is the  &quot;typical&quot; suburbanite (Mrs. Givings). I was looking for a glimmer  of hope, but didn't find one. Maybe that was Yates's intention. A  thoroughly enjoyable read, however.	2000-02-17

It was absolutely by chance that I discovered Richard Yates for myself. I was of the strong persuasion that nothing that was worth reading was written after the 1920's. Since then I have read all of his works. He is a  writer who should be studied in schools. We cannot afford to neglect such  brilliancy, it just doesn't come around too often in our day and age. He is  a genius and if our time still manages to produce someone like Richard  Yates, all is not lost.	1999-06-12

Their lives start falling apart when they decide to move to Paris on a whim and the wife accidentally gets pregnant before they leave (they already have 2 children).  The story covers everything from the &#34;truths&#34; we tell ourselves about our lives to mental illness to childhood trauma and the inability the find satisfaction in everyday life.  The husband (thinks he) loathes his job; the wife hates being a housewife and mother.  Their view of themselves and each other is a real odyssey into human frailty, guilt, self-delusion and disappointment, but believe me, it's worth the read (even if you don't love sad novels).  This was apparently a sensation when it was published and I can't think of any reason why it should sink back into oblivion - it deserves our attention, and much of it.	2014-05-01

Yates is a skilled writer, and he has a point to make about society, but the book is so bleak, and he has such patent contempt for his characters that it was very difficult to read. His skill makes you want to find out what happens, but it is not an enjoyable journey. I read it for my book club, and most of us had the same reaction. The therapist in the group was the only one who didn't react with the need to shake off the book, and that's because she sees this kind of depressing behavior every day and has ways to shield herself from it.	2013-02-21

Yates was ahead of his time though because how many books and movies since have dealt with the dark side of idyllic suburban life and he got there first.	2013-01-12

Yates puts feelings into words like no other author I have ever read. This story is sad, but the charachters are very well developed, I honestly cared for both Frank and April. I felt that I understood the feelings of both main characters and could relate so well to many of their feelings. The reality of their story is haunting, and Yates has written it beautifully. This is what writing should be like. I could read this book again, It is easy to wrap yourself up in the writing style and feel with the characters. I wish there were more books as beautifully written as this one was. Richard Yates is an instant favorite for me, I would encourage readers to pick this one up.	2012-05-18

I ran across it while searching for stories set in the late 50s and early 60s. Who knew that post-war suburbia had been so decadent?! Sure there were the ad men who populated Madison Avenue, those geniuses who promised Americans their Lucky Strikes would always be 'toasted', but Revolutionary Road is set outside this sphere.<br /><br />The book opens with April Wheeler, the typical suburban housewife, doing a stint in community theater. The early pages aren't particularly captivating--I wondered if the book would even be worth finishing. But like a lot of great novels, I arrived at a certain point and realized I was reading something wonderful--can't remember just when I came to this conclusion either. (Much like taking Motrin for a headache and discovering, quite suddenly, that the headache left awhile ago, though the moment of its departure is impossible to pinpoint).<br /><br />The Wheelers are a young couple. Frank Wheeler, husband of April, believes himself superior to other men, and his wife shares this view. She indulges him despite his affairs outside the home--likely because she has had a tryst of her own. As the novel progresses, her indulgence and flattery reach crisis and pull the couple into a moderate bleakness. The conclusion of the book is horrific. I didn't realize how dark their lives had become until very near the end. I won't give the conclusion away here, but the sum of their conjoined psychosis is paid out in tragedy.<br /><br />Highly recommended	2012-02-20

I didn't care for the characters; granted this takes place in 1955 where men were the bread winners and women stayed home to cook, clean and raise the kids.  The main characters were self centered and after awhile they got on my nerves.  I started skipping chapters to just end the book.  I do not recommend this book	2012-01-18
US	48368188	RXEJERS6IGDLL	B001CBMX9C	840034938	Revolutionary Road	Digital_Ebook_Purchase	4	0	0	N	N	Timelessness of the 1950s	Revolutionary Road reminded me a lot of other books that I have read, especially those by Anne Tyler, which were written decades after Revolutionary Road.  It is not an easy, pleasant book but is filled with the hardness of human life.  Yates uses 1950s suburban Connecticut to paint a bleak picture of alienation in the midst of surface plenty and peace.  Alienation occurs on all levels of life - from spouses, from children, from parents, from neighbors, from work, and most desperately from self.  The book is so soaked in booze that much of the story seems to come through a haze of corrupted understanding and search for truths that people are unwilling or unable to face.      Unfortunately, this also leads to my misgivings about the book.  The writing is beautiful and precise.  Unfortunately, the characters are not.  Where I was supposed to empathize, I was unable to do so.  Where I was supposed to feel hope, I was unable to do so.  It was all a bit too soaked in booze.  If this was the intention, then kudos to Richard Yates.  But this part of the book left me feeling a bit disappointed.	2011-05-25

Revolutionary Road masterfully captures the tensions of marriage, the disparities between wanting to say something and what is actually said, and the escalating hpes and dreams that seem perfectly tangible and then wither away. While some of the plot, particularly toward the end, seems slightly formulaic, the overall novel is nothing short of a masterpiece.	2009-12-23

While Yates is a skilled writer, his main characters, Frank and April Wheeler, fail to illicit sympathy or even interest. This is truly unfortunate as the plot is a universal one. Many a young person, be that of the 20th century generation of \\"Revolutionary Road\\" or the 21st, has a dream of becoming someone unique, a dream often dashed by the need of making a living.<br /><br />April and Frank Wheeler are a young couple who consider themselves artists of some kind or other. While reliving their parents' lifestyle of suburbia, replete with home, kids, and Frank's mind-dulling job to pay for it, they ridicule the very life they're living. If truth be told, it's hard to feel empathy for the Wheelers. They're so completely self-involved that they have little time even for their children. When April Wheeler bombs in her community theater acting debut, she promptly gives up and blames everyone else but herself. Frank Wheeler, while protesting to despise his father's career choice, goes to work for the same firm. When April comes up with a nutty escape scheme so Frank can quit his job and \\"find himself,\\" the jig is up. While he agrees, he has no real intentions to go through with it. When Frank confesses an office affair, April's non-reaction doesn't ring true. At this point, the story disintegrates into one useless discussion after another, one silly scene followed by another. April has an affair with a neighbor she despises. Another neighbor's crazy son, the author wants us to believe, is the only character that speaks to the truth, but actually none of the characters are authentic. Tragedy follows tragedy as the story limps to an improbable ending.<br /><br />In \\"Revolutionary Road,\\" the real tragedy is that Richard Yates never fell in love with his own creation. With a writer, who didn't care to explore the true depths of his characters' emotions, I pronounce this novel DOA.otions, I pronounce this novel DOA.	2009-02-04

It ended up being all that I hoped it would be- powerful, emotional, never long-winded, with a compelling point-of-view. I went into it knowing that there were themes expressed in the book that had been addressed by other writers at other times; fortunately this is not a problem as Yates avoids all possible traps. I found the story to be unique and poetic, and it moved me profoundly.	2009-02-03
